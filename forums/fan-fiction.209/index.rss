      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">I've browsed through so many debates on proving/debunking time travel at this point, both here and elsewhere, that the point of them has become rather silly. I am a stern advocate for humanity needing a clearer idea of what TT entails before even starting to discuss possible ways to prove it to be real. When someone says &quot;how would you prove it if you were a time traveller?&quot; or &quot;how can you prove that John Titor was real/fake?&quot;, I just sort it in the &quot;if a tree falls in the woods and no one...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Has anyone seen the preview for The Butterfly Effect movie coming out next month? It looks awesome <a href="http://www.butterflyeffectmovie.com/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.butterflyeffectmovie.com/</a> It's about a guy that learns that he has the ability to change things he's done in the past. The special effects in the movie show the changes that happened as a result (using 3D morphing) He's faced with the consequences of changing the past only to have to go back to another time to fix the worse things...<br />

<br />
You must all first sing the song from Lost Horizionm, Liveing And working togeaher.Do it, dont ask why.<br />
<br />
Secondly time travel accidents can look like this.A time traveler materializes with half of his machine in a tree, is laying on the back half unconscious as if this had been a wreck.A large ice cream truck shows up that looks as if to be a gasoline tanker, however is full of ice cream and people are handing out free icecream...<br />

<br />
Simon &amp; Garfunkle - Hazy Shade of Winter<br />
<br />
Time, time, time, see what's become of me<br />
While I looked around<br />
For my possibilities<br />
I was so hard to please<br />
But look around, leaves are brown<br />
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter<br />
<br />
Hear the salvation army band<br />
Down by the riverside, it's bound to be a better ride<br />
Than what you've got planned<br />
Carry your cup in your hand<br />
And look around, leaves are brown now<br />
And the sky is a hazy shade of...<br />
