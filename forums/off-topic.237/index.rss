I have no idea about time travel or any other common topics that are being discussed on this forum, but I'll make sure to read everything, who knows, maybe I learn something useful in the process.<br />

I don't think I'll create too many topics or reply to those I read since I probably won't have anything relevant to add to the conversation, but, just in case, please excuse any horrendous English misspells, after all this ain't my 1st language.</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 18px"><b>Texans may be able to hunt feral hogs from a hot air balloon.</b><br />
</span><br />
In one of the more interesting pieces of legislation introduced recently, a bill has been introduced that would make hunting  feral hogs from a hot air balloon legal.<br />
<br />
House Bill 3392 would allow for a landowner, or someone with the landowner’s permission, to use a hot air balloon for hog hunting. Permits could start being issued as soon as September 1st of this year.  <br />
<br />
Good idea or bad ? and why ?</div>]]></content:encoded>

This area is shaped up now, as I had to legally lay this issue down, because it had involved in probability many hundreds of humans here on this world. In other words, not just myself, as I had and have a past affinity to this area.<br />

This is summed as yes' there is an active current connection...<br />

<br />
After watching Tucker Carlson's April 26th, 2017 episode, I decided that this needs to be said. American freedom is in grave danger. When our young college students do not believe in the same values that we have grown to love and cherish, we risk losing our freedom when these students grow up and enter the working force. These young folks will be our lawmakers, our lawyers, our judges, our policemen, our doctors, our teachers, our politicians, and our professors...<br />

Lava deltas are new land formed from lava that enters the sea and hardens in a wide fan shape. They are usually layers upon layers of sloping loose fragments and lava flow. They're awesome to look at and visit, but they can be very unstable and collapse...<br />
