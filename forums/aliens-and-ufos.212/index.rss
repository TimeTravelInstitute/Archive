According to John Lear and others, the Pentagon wanted to make a partial UFO disclosure documentary around 1973, and was the first attempt by the government to release information to the public. <br />
<br />
The result of this motivation was a documentary released in 1973, hosted by Rod Serling, (from The Twilight Zone). The documentary was called: UFOs: It Has Begun, but was originally titled UFOs: Past, Present and Future. It was produced by Sandler Films which is...<br />

 <br />
<br />
A live NASA feed allegedly picked up a transparent cylindrical object zooming past the ISS (International Space Station) this week.  It is shown in the photo above.  <br />
<br />
Of course, we need a lot more data to assume this is an alien object.  Was anyone up in the space station performing experiements?  Could it be space junk?  Or were aliens sending a banking cylinder down to earth to make a deposit?  haha.<br />
<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">One of the reasons people are skeptical of alien encounters is the huge technological barriers for space travel. The distances and time it would take to travel to Earth from another planet capable of sustaining life is insurmountable to some. If it is possible, it's highly likely an alien race would be insanely technologically advanced. Given this technological advancement, is it even possible for us to interact with them in any meaningful way?<br />

<br />
<br />
I haven't posted here in a while, but something crazy happened to me tonight.  I saw a UFO.<br />
<br />
<br />
While walking home from work, I noticed a green, flying object.  It caught my eye because it was an unusual color, and it was solid.  It wasn't flashing, nor were there any other colored lights.  I began recording it when I noticed it simply stopped near the Sear's Tower.  The videos are below.  I am open to any ideas as to what this could be.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">One of the most convincing UfO/alien sightings I have read, occured in 1994, at a primary school in Zimbabwe and was reportedly witnessed by 60 school children.  I remember a few years ago reading through some comments on a youtube link (concerning the school sighting) and saw a couple of comments of others who witnessed the UfO while travelling along a highway by car, within close proximity of the school.  Anyway, here is a link to an interesting video, of the children who are now adults...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">For aliens to reach earth, their technology would have to be far more advanced then ours. Also possibly they might have evolved so they no longer even need physical bodies. Maybe they no longer have the capability of speech as we know it, but have evolved to use a much more advanced method of communication.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if there are aliens, why would they actually bother contacting us ? Everything they need to know about us they could find out just by observation.</div>]]></content:encoded>

The creature would have to be able to live off CO2. Who is to say that it can't?  I...<br />

There have been numerous sightings of UFO's prior to some event occuring, which may suggest that the UFO's and the occupant(s) maybe &quot;observing&quot;.

Anyway, it is believe that the Pyramid of Sphinx was built by UFO's because of its perfectness, from the bricks  - measurement is exact and perfect and scientists believed that that type of knowledge has not existed during those era.

As time has passed, I find myself much less convinced by the idea.  Essentially, I learned that a lot of the underlying facts which support the theory are just flat out wrong.<br />

For example, the translations of Ancient Sumarian relied upon by Ancient Astronaut Theory are dead wrong.  There are examples of the proponents exaggerating...<br />
