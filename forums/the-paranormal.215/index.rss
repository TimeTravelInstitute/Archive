      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">I read and saw a video yesterday about yet another area that people are hearing strange sounds in the air.

I found a radio blog by Linda Moulton Howe that saws that they think this is from seismic activity, some articles think it is from fracking.  I personally have no idea what it is but I have heard it and at the time I wondered if perhaps I was getting an ear infection or something.  It is scary stuff...<br />

The video was in portuguese and I posted it with a quick translation I did. But, that thread was one of those lost in the migration from one forum software to another. I'll post it again sometime.<br />

<br />
Well partners, some time ago I posted a video of these two gentlemen called Rhett and Link talking about time travel. Also a while ago, I posted something about number stations, a mistery that I found very intriguing.<br />
Well, to my surprise, today's video on Good Mythical Morning (the show of the previously mentioned fellows) talks about not only the number stations but also about Benjaman Kyle, a guy PaulaJedi posted about.<br />

Anyway, they don't dive in in any of the subjects and...<br />
