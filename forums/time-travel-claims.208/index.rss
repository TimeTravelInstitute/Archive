After Nikola Tesla's death, the FBI ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings, even though Tesla was an American citizen.<br />

About Me<br />
Dash Motohito<br />
The time machine was first invented in the year 2011, still in itâ€™s nascent stage, it did not permit matter, but only energy to travel. I am currently in the year 2062 and am using a telereceptor in Japan to blog from. I am blogging back to the year 2011. I am Dash Motohito, and as of 2011, I am still unborn.<br />

By CHAD KULTGEN<br />
<br />
NEW YORK â€” Federal investigators have arrested an enigmatic Wall Street wiz on insider-trading charges â€” and incredibly, he claims to be a time-traveler from the year 2256!<br />
<br />
Sources at the Security and Exchange Commission confirm that 44-year-old Andrew Carlssin offered the bizarre explanation for his uncanny success in the stock market after being led off in handcuffs on January 28.<br />
