<br />
<br />
     There is still more to be gleaned in materials related to the Montauk projects.  This week alone I have seen several boggling write-ups on mind control going back into the late 1940's, that confirms my personal premises that Montauk could have been a fully active experiment in the late 1950's when I visited the Light at least twice.<br />

<br />
Hi, a few years ago when I was a teenager, I travelled with my family to Montauk, Long Island for a vacation there. We stayed at the Beach Comba (if that is how it is spelt) Resort. We spent most of the vacation renting movies FROM the hotel lobby, going to the beach, and exploring the area. It was alot of fun.<br />
<br />
I am aware some people will question my honesty about this, but I'm not lying. The Montauk base does exist, I'm not sure if that is a question...<br />
