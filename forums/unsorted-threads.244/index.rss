Biological Warfare facilities in Maryland, Utah, and Panama, and is<br />

<br />
I am a game developer and currently have a fairly large project in development which includes some time travel. Ive been thinking about it a lot and have been going back and forth on how the event of changing the past should work in terms of the games story. Ive been doing a lot of research on the subject and have been an avid fan of anything time travel related since I was a small child. I figured if I could get some well informed opinions then this would be the place to...<br />

<br />
I've experienced it a few times &amp; not really sure what to make of it. There was a feeling of being in the exact situation already &amp; it almost felt like something was being changed, an alternate path.. The mind is a weird place for sure. Almost seems like it's natures way of letting us correct in spirit/current time line what the body didn't do in the physical/past time lines.<br />

Some interesting things out...<br />

He has been a guest on the Bell show 2 times and you can listen to the interviews with him by going here (provided that you have RealPlayer, a sound card, and speakers):<br />

We were formed in 2007, and I took some time out of my days as a hobby. I eventually got it working. However after 3 trips which which are in this order. 1 hour, 3 hours, 5 years in the past. After the 3rd trip it caught fire in our yard where we test. I'm rebuilding it, and reached 1 hour in just 20 minutes on a pebble! The main reason I'm posting here...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">I want to start a time travel study group. This is NOT for skeptics, but for those who believe time travel is possible. The purpose of the group will be to try to build a time travel device using schematics from a number of individuals.

<br />
<br />
Sorry to disappoint some of you (if really exists anyone) but accept it... if a real time traveller came to <i>this </i>time, he surely wouldn't mind to make his travel public at least if we consider a sane human makes that journey.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seeing this section and those self-proclaimed &quot;time travellers&quot; it's funny, and interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's a shame, it seems that entropy also makes effect on the web forums. Greetings from 2014!</div>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
I just started wondering about realities of time travel and have come across one basic question.<br />
<br />
<i><b>If some event has already happened how can we undo it even if we travel faster than the light.</b></i><br />
<br />
Suppose if i was born in the 17th century on a planet X , and one day, at a particular time, i performed some action like throwing a ball. Now that event has already happened, notwithstanding the speed of light. If some one from other galaxy on planet Y, who is capable of...<br />
