      <title>Proper themes for TTI</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I've changed the default theme to one that's a bit closer to how TTI used to look. We're using TARDIS blue as the primary accent and we've recovered the logo <a href="https://timetravelinstitute.com/members/2/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="2" data-username="@Mop">@Mop</a> was originally using <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
There's a dark theme available also, and you can enable that using the theme selection menu in the footer:<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">To try and keep things somewhat uniform between TTI and Curious Cosmos, the chat feature here has been replaced with full Discord integration. <br />
<br />
This integration will place TTI members in a &quot;Members&quot; group on the server, and there is a &quot;Members Only&quot; channel there if you want to keep discussions from being interrupted by random guests dropping in.<br />
<br />
New threads, posts, and status updates will be broadcast to the #general channel as well <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hey guys!<br />
<br />
As an addendum to my December 2017 update, I've spun the <a href="https://curiouscosmos.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">CuriousCosmos.com</a> domain off into it's own new, fresh site.<br />
<br />
This site is reverting back to the Time Travel Institute name, and will remain on xenForo indefinitely. I've reverted the categories to the way they were pre-September 2014 as well, and over time I'll move things back to their original places as time allows.<br />
<br />
The reason we're doing this is two-fold:<br />
<br />
1: I made a commitment...<br />

<br />
The chat feature here at TTI will remain, but future Friday Chats will occur on Curious Cosmos:<br />

<br />
Every Friday from 5 PM to 9 PM PST, all of our members (and guests!) are invited to join us in our Discord channel! As of now, there's not really a set topic. We'll discuss whatever comes up, and since you're on this site, we'll probably be able to think of something...<br />

Starting this Friday, I'll be in the chatroom every week from 5PM to 9PM PST.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to chat about anything in particular, you're more than welcome to join me <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> We're pretty quiet these days, but hopefully having a weekly time to hang out will help things grow and we can get things back on track!<br />
<br />
There's no set topic, so we'll talk about whatever comes up. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite28" alt=":alien:" title="Alien    :alien:" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
If anyone has any ideas or something they'd like to contribute, feel free to drop me.a PM.<br />

Now, off to finish being sick (for my whole holiday break, lol) and to bring the New Year in in style.</div>]]></content:encoded>

I've re-enabled the chatroom feature and it should be visible up there in the navigation tab:<br />
<a href="https://curiouscosmos.com/chat/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">https://curiouscosmos.com/chat/</a><br />
<br />
We're still pretty slow, but I thought it was a good idea to put that back up anyways. I'll be in chat a couple times a day just to see if anything is happening, but will be posting a schedule showing when I'll be in there and available for extended periods of time<br />
<br />
Right now I'm thinking Fridays from 5 to 8 PST, but we'll see what works...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
If you're reading this, you've no doubt noticed that we're no longer running Discourse. I've spent the last week or two getting everything back on xenForo, and xenForo is where we're going to stay.<br />
<br />
When I bought the site from Mop in 2014, I promised to keep everything online because I believe that the threads we have here are a fascinating cross-section of internet culture. As a fan of &quot;internet archeology&quot;, there's all sorts of interesting and fascinating things here that you...<br />

The problem wasn't TTI but rather another site we host and operate on the same VPS. Regardless, it's something to think about. It's a reminder that come December 31, there will be no more TTI. So prepare accordingly. Make sure your survival kits are fully stocked.<br />

<br />
I'm here to give you a heads up on what's going on with the old messages. So far, I've recovered them, so they're safe and sound. Now I have to figure out how to format them so that they're usable and presentable. But let's be clear about some things:<br />
<br />
- You will be able to read the messages<br />
- You will NOT be able to reply to the old messages<br />
- You will NOT be able to post new messages in the old format (the old format is gone... kiss it good-bye)<br />
<br />
I'm giving you advance warning...<br />

We'll start simple and work our way from there. Right now, the question is &quot;Do you believe that time travel is possible?&quot;.<br />

Thanks,<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hi!<br />
<br />
We're using new banner code for the advertising banners at the top of the web page. It's suppose to permit &quot;rich media&quot; (Java, Enliven, etc.). Has anyone encounter problems with this (perhaps the whole page did not load, etc.)?<br />
<br />
Let us know by posting any details you can (or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@xone.net">webmaster@xone.net</a> with &quot;Bug&quot; as subject line if you can't post).<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
