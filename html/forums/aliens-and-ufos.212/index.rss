According to John Lear and others, the Pentagon wanted to make a partial UFO disclosure documentary around 1973, and was the first attempt by the government to release information to the public. <br />
<br />
The result of this motivation was a documentary released in 1973, hosted by Rod Serling, (from The Twilight Zone). The documentary was called: UFOs: It Has Begun, but was originally titled UFOs: Past, Present and Future. It was produced by Sandler Films which is...<br />

 <br />
<br />
A live NASA feed allegedly picked up a transparent cylindrical object zooming past the ISS (International Space Station) this week.  It is shown in the photo above.  <br />
<br />
Of course, we need a lot more data to assume this is an alien object.  Was anyone up in the space station performing experiements?  Could it be space junk?  Or were aliens sending a banking cylinder down to earth to make a deposit?  haha.<br />
<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">I will be very blunt and to the point on this asking, as this is slightly more than a hunch to me. So I will word this request very carefully.<br />
