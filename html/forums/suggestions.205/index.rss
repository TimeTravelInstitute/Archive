1. Create a style then dark style - TTI<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hello Site Support,<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have a RSS style feed to and back on forum posts in Curious Cosmos on the TTI website.<br />
<br />
The rationale is TTI should be a site for learning, peer review, and maybe one day an accredited institution. <br />
<br />
I wonder what would happen if you modeled the website like <a href="http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">Kaplan University | Online College Courses â€“ Campus and Online University</a><br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />

God bless.</div>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
Current Events and Politics forums need to be kept up with, stay on topic and adhere to all of our rules... But it'd be interesting to see the passionate debates and more extreme viewpoints that otherwise don't belong in &quot;civilized&quot; discussion.<br />
<br />
This forum, while not moderated, would still need to adhere to a FEW rules:<br />
<br />
*Nothing...<br />

We've bounced around to some different platforms, tried adding or removing features, experimented with sister-sites... The whole bit. None of it worked, and our community has suffered for it. I'm not pleased with that being the end result, but it is what it is, and it's time to move forward.<br />

In previous posts, I've said that I believe the future of TTI lies beyond the forums. That I need to pursue the site *I* want to be part of.<br />

<br />
<br />
I asked our host to set up an SSL certificate on the site last night so that we could enjoy some more secure browsing, but they botched the install. The site has NOT been hacked and nobody is stealing information, it's just the SSL certificate not being installed properly.<br />
<br />
<br />
As of now, I think I've fixed things to where attempts to visit the broken SSL...<br />
