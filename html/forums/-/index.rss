Now I am a time traveller of some ill repute, I have not travelled back from 2036 to get an ancient computer to save the world, I am from about five centuries in the future, it's still going. I am typing on one of your ancient keyboards with my bejewelled claws and laugh at your primitive software. This is us future people's usual reaction to your prehistoric computer systems. Ask me a question about the future, I might answer it.<br />

No, I am not buying...<br />

<br />
Therefore you could not have killed anyone as you never existed. Now this means your granny couldn’t have been killed by you. She didn’t die nine years old. This permits you to be born.<br />

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Quantum Hall annexes fourth dimension</b></span><br />
The quantum Hall effect, discovered in the 1980s, is an important fundamental effect in condensed matter physics that links topological states with electronic properties in two-dimensional systems. The quantized conductance is prescribed by an integer global topological invariant and is therefore protected against perturbations. Such invariants are characterized by a so-called...<br />
