								<div class="bbWrapper">TTA and Shawdow,<br />
 I will talk to you but please no name calling or I will not respond. Yes the numbers are hard but in no way as hard as what you will experience in the future without them. I will start by telling you my experience. I am married now for 17 years and have 2 children. The numbers started for me about  5 years ago. My husband has seen them for 14 years.  At the time I was going to church, a methodist church and had been for 10 years. When the numbers started I started hearing woices in church. I would leave every sunday in tears and very upset. The voice told me and I  quote &quot; This is not what I meant&quot; I assumed it was Jesus.<br />
So I quite going to church. It was to much for me to handle. My husband was upset because he liked church and was very involved.<br />
At that point I just didn't care. So I started staying home. The numbers became more numerous and I started looking for answers. One day in my back yard I said to Jesus if you exist you better tell me what the hell is going on or I am going to believe you are dead and buried. I was ready never to set foot in a church again. Well from then on I became telepathic. He would talk to me in my mind and tell me different things . I was very sick at the time so I ask him what was wrong. He led me to that information which is to bizzare to say here. I had to go through emotional healing work to cure myself it was not easy. He told me alot about sickness and why people are so sick and yes he introduced me to our alien brothers and sisters. Then he had to test me so I could claim my power. At first I thought I had met the devil himself but when I came to my senses I realized why he was being so hard on me. My husband and I were fighting about everything. I realized that every time I saw numbers we would fight or somebody would fight about something. I started using the numbers to condition myself to these events. I remember the first time I claimed my power. My family and I  were driving in the car and an argument broke out well I almost jumped right there and yelled myself but a few moments before I had seen the numbers so I knew what was coming. I just started laughing they looked at me like I was crazy. I was so proud of myself .It was my first lesson in self control.think a minute about the events that transpired around Jesus. He  did not loose control but those around him did Thats why he died. He showed them how mad they could get and they ended up killing him. they couldn't face their own demons so they took it out on him . Since then I use the numbers they don't use me. The world is going through a very tough time right now . You will need all the help you can get. It wont be easy for any of us. I have seen the future also but the things I have seen do not involve anyone having to travel through time. Humans are predictable to a certain extent. also there are those that can see from far away. looking down at he earth and know what events will transpire simply because they are out there and we are down here. There are certain things I cannot tell you because it is against universal law. You must learn for yourselves. Everybody is waiting for Jesus to return  The fact is he already has. remember he said he would come like a theif in the nite well thats true. He cannot save you it is against universal law but he can help you to save yourself. I have probably told you to much. But I am desperate to help you because I know what you are going through. My sources told me to tell you  that there are others who are using the number system and they are not good they use it as a signature for there work sort of like serial killers do. They always leave a message in there work. I think the events of 911 is just that, a signature.<br />
I know there are dark forces I have experienced them. The only way to stop them is to learn self control. Use the numbers to learn about yourself and whats going on. The only way dark forces can use you is if you let them. They cannot harm you or anyone else if you learn self control. I know its hard but you can do it. Once you get control the numbers will change in order to help you. They may ask you to move to a safe location. they may ask you to tell someone something Like I am doing now.Believe me I would never hurt anyone but the future depends on us following through. If this earth falls to dark forces it may be hundreds of thousands of years before we get another chance. If you allow yourself to move forward and learn this then maybe I will be given permission to tell you more. If you choose not to I will accept that and move on. It is your choice and I cannot take that from you. I would like to ask you to rethink your position on Jesus he is not a time traveler. He does travel astraly. The meaning is very simple about how he healed. It wasn't done with any devices from the future. the blind will see the dead will rise. It is all so very simple if you knew you would laugh and so ohh! how clever I would have never thought of that. but I cannot reveal that only he is allowed to tell you. Ask him and I bet he will show you. <br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Clara,<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I will talk to you but please no name calling or I will not respond.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
You mean, do not speak the truth? Nah, I rather speak the truth.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Yes the numbers are hard but in no way as hard as what you will experience in the future without them.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
So far, it sounds like the same old thing Clara, you want us to accept it, and allow them to exploit us.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I will start by telling you my experience. I am married now for 17 years and have 2 children. The numbers started for me about 5 years ago. My husband has seen them for 14 years. At the time I was going to church, a methodist church and had been for 10 years. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Well no wonder you don't like religions, you obviously must have had bad experiences with them, and growing up to I'm sure. Did you have religion shoved down your throat?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt; When the numbers started I started hearing woices in church. I would leave every sunday in tears and very upset. The voice told me and I quote &quot; This is not what I meant&quot; I assumed it was Jesus.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Well when I first heard the voices, it told me this: 'I am the Ancient One, who will come to you in new light to spread in the darkness of your delusions.'<br />
<br />
Visions of Jesus Christ surfaced in me afterwardsâ€¦ <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;So I quite going to church. It was to much for me to handle. My husband was upset because he liked church and was very involved.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear that. You were very aware that something was not right, and didn't accept it, because you knew it instinctly. You sure changed though.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;At that point I just didn't care. So I started staying home. The numbers became more numerous and I started looking for answers. One day in my back yard I said to Jesus if you exist you better tell me what the hell is going on or I am going to believe you are dead and buried.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Yes Yes, we've all gone through that moment. At one point or another most of us ask God the 'you better, or else' question.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I was ready never to set foot in a church again. Well from then on I became telepathic.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Been thereâ€¦ can't wait to hear how you took the turn into New Age doctrine. <br />
<br />
I'm just responding as I read, I'm quite in a hurry right now <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;He would talk to me in my mind and tell me different things . I was very sick at the time so I ask him what was wrong. He led me to that information which is to bizzare to say here.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Ahhhh, I thought you were finally going to level with us?<br />
<br />
Well that's okay, I can tell you what my voices said. At first they started off being very nice and patient. Then I started to wonder about the principles behind certain things it was mentioning to me to do. I then said 'but isn't that wrong' excuses and spins, just like the ones you gave is all I got. It wasn't until I started to go along doing things my own way, that it started to get a little hostile. Just because I wouldn't follow their path of ignorance, and don't ask any smart questions.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I had to go through emotional healing work to cure myself it was not easy. He told me alot about sickness and why people are so sick and yes he introduced me to our alien brothers and sisters.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
He? Who's He? The voice?<br />
<br />
I think I figured out why I didn't turn to your New Age doctrine <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
<br />
I never get sick, I haven't had so much as a sore throat in over 2 years. <br />
<br />
I was never brought down to my knees as to give up and turn to your fellow 'brothers and sisters from the sky' <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />. <br />
<br />
My combination of soul, with this phenomenon sure has developed something different. A breed that is undying and will not rest til justice is served. The TimeTravelActivist emerges out of this a fighter for the people. Not one to talk them into selling out, like some people.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Then he had to test me so I could claim my power.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Oh huh, now your taking spooky stuffâ€¦ 'Claim your power' define what that is for once.<br />
<br />
Bytheway, what did you think about Heaven's Gate and their philosophy? Sounds very similar to what your trying to sell to people here. A life in another world, with your 'brothers and sisters from the sky.'<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;At first I thought I had met the devil himself but when I came to my senses I realized why he was being so hard on me.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Well you know what. When I faced the Devil and his minions (meaning Time Travelers and their lackeys i.e. New Age followers) I pretty much knew who I was facing. My psychic abilities in my dreams probed deep enough to uncover their true agenda.<br />
<br />
Your seems more developed in your mind as faith and acceptance of what's happening to you. Without question any longer, I am sure.<br />
<br />
I have seen Time Travelers. I have had visions of being in the future, and meeting people I would someday meet. And I am pretty sure, CAT has too <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" />.<br />
<br />
This is Time Travel Clara. Just how ancient humanity didn't have the capacity to comprehend that maybe Angels could be future Time Travelers, using technology to make it seem that they were from God. Could very easily buy into people's strong faith and conviction and make them believe it, to get them to do what they wanted them to do.<br />
<br />
Just how what's happening with you.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;My husband and I were fighting about everything. I realized that every time I saw numbers we would fight or somebody would fight about something.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Like I said. Coming to the point of something, and seeing the numbers, indicate that Time Travelers have incurred your Time Line to come to this. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I started using the numbers to condition myself to these events. I remember the first time I claimed my power. My family and I were driving in the car and an argument broke out well I almost jumped right there and yelled myself but a few moments before I had seen the numbers so I knew what was coming. I just started laughing they looked at me like I was crazy.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Sounds more like that was the moment you sold out and gave up. You should have met me before you did. I might have been able to talk sense into you 5 years ago. If it didn't happen to me 3 years ago, though <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I was so proud of myself .It was my first lesson in self control.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
A grown woman, and barely learned self-control. And now you feel you understand this perfectly and are more spiritually superior then us to tell us what this phenomena is? <br />
<br />
Oh come on Clara, listen to your self.<br />
<br />
Try living through a tougher situation then just people arguing all around you. I can see why you still detach your self and don't like people disagreeing with you. You still haven't learned to handle situations like that. You just avoid them.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;think a minute about the events that transpired around Jesus. He did not loose control but those around him did Thats why he died.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
He died, because he knew he was destined to die and be martyred as a Messiah. <br />
<br />
And if Jesus was alive now, I'm pretty sure he would put you in check with this New Age/Acceptance of Evil/TimeTravelers/Manipluation and control of people crap, you keep putting a spin on. This is what it all basically is. Taken off the sugar coating and frosting and the cute little pink bow <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />, you see that under all that hype and goodness you thought it was. Is really just a plot to control people. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;He showed them how mad they could get and they ended up killing him. they couldn't face their own demons so they took it out on him .&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Is that why you got that way too when I exposed you? All this talk about loving everybody, sure changed. To having you call us all uncivilized and unenlightened. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Since then I use the numbers they don't use me.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Right, you just keep telling your self that. I am sure you believe it too.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;The world is going through a very tough time right now . You will need all the help you can get. It wont be easy for any of us.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
This is a tough time; I have to deal with New Age'rs who want others to sanction this someday. I have to work hard and fast to make sure they aren't left ignorant of the consequences. Would you like to help and show others 2 sides to this?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I have seen the future also but the things I have seen do not involve anyone having to travel through time. Humans are predictable to a certain extent. also there are those that can see from far away. looking down at he earth and know what events will transpire simply because they are out there and we are down here.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Your Alien buddies again, huh Clara?<br />
<br />
Well do you really think they would tell you exactly what their hidden agenda is?<br />
<br />
Tell me something people, if you found out tomorrow that there were aliens coming, wouldn't you like to know where they been and what they been doing all this time?<br />
<br />
They will never show them selves to you, because people like me and others will ask to many questions that will expose their whole conspiracy. Completely ruining religions and New Age doctrine, like Solara's. <br />
<br />
Maybe they should be exposed. Then maybe people would see that we really need to be independent, and choose our own path. Not the one they are forcing us to take.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;There are certain things I cannot tell you because it is against universal law. You must learn for yourselves.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Your so full of it Clara. You don't know jackâ€¦ If you did, you would tell us. As I have told everyone the secrets of their plans. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Everybody is waiting for Jesus to return The fact is he already has.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Even the Non-Christians? What about the Muslims, are they waiting for Jesus too? How about the hindu's? No? Then how about the Jehovah Witnesses?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;remember he said he would come like a theif in the nite well thats true. He cannot save you it is against universal law but he can help you to save yourself.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
And let me guess, accepting your New Age God and allowing your little green friends from your Uranus is the only way right? How convenient. <br />
<br />
You make a good New Age spokesperson. I hope you work on commissions, cause I sure ain't buying what your selling <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />. Selling out that is.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I have probably told you to much.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Hold on, wait, I think I know the end to this line <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> 'And now, I gotta kill you.'<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;But I am desperate to help you because I know what you are going through.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Spare me Clara, your only 2 years ahead of me with dealing with this. And others, 10 years or more. You appoint your self as truly knowing better and having the absolute truth to this. But you don't have it. <br />
<br />
The truth is this. You are a human being. You are in theory meant to live freely. You have the right to know what is happening to you, and who's doing it. To know the truth, and ask questions. <br />
<br />
You gave that up along time ago. You stopped asking questions, you already made up your mind that it's ethical for it to happen, and for your own good. And so you assume it's what everybody else going through this wants and will end up to.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;My sources told me to tell you that there are others who are using the number system and they are not good they use it as a signature for there work sort of like serial killers do. They always leave a message in there work. I think the events of 911 is just that, a signature.&gt;&gt; <br />
<br />
Clara, I'm beginning to think that you really have no idea what your talking about. <br />
<br />
Listen, if you also believe that, then how then would your case be explained as being good? How would you tell the difference between the bad ones and the good ones?<br />
<br />
Quit trying to PR and put a spin on everything. It is, what it is. And that is control. <br />
<br />
Bottom line.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I know there are dark forces I have experienced them. The only way to stop them is to learn self control.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
The Dark forces are the numbers. And we have evidence on Sept. 11th to prove it. They orchestrated this, and so it took place. Your then going to believe what ever your sources tell you, and say that it was the bad tribe of number inflicting creatures that are responsible. Oh pleaseâ€¦<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Use the numbers to learn about yourself and whats going on.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Why not just say what you're wanting to say? <br />
<br />
Tell the people to accept it? Come on, that's basically what your saying anyways.<br />
<br />
Accept being exploited. <br />
<br />
Accept being USED!<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;The only way dark forces can use you is if you let them.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Look, 5,000 were caught in the cross fire of these Time Travelers web. I am very certain that not all 5,000 chose the dark forces, which you speak. <br />
<br />
Do you have any idea what your even talking about?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;They cannot harm you or anyone else if you learn self control. I know its hard but you can do it. Once you get control the numbers will change in order to help you.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Yeah, help change the world to what they deem fit.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;They may ask you to move to a safe location. they may ask you to tell someone something Like I am doing now.Believe me I would never hurt anyone but the future depends on us following through.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
So your voices are asking you nicely? How convenientâ€¦<br />
<br />
They must know then, that you are speaking to the TimeTravelActivist, and are fearing being exposed. So of course they are being nice to you.<br />
<br />
How else would you feel being put on the spot, for millions of crimes that are staked against you? <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;If this earth falls to dark forces it may be hundreds of thousands of years before we get another chance.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
So that justifies it then? It's the end justifies the means approach huh?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;If you allow yourself to move forward and learn this then maybe I will be given permission to tell you more.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
So your claiming to have all the answers to our survival? <br />
<br />
Permission? So whatcha going to do, get down on your knees, put your hands together and say 'Please Master, tell me more, I think they are ready?'<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;If you choose not to I will accept that and move on. It is your choice and I cannot take that from you.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Though since you got here, you've been wanting to give us no choice, but to follow yours. And leave principles and humanity behind.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I would like to ask you to rethink your position on Jesus he is not a time traveler.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Clara, what exactly do you know about Time Travel?<br />
<br />
I am assuming not a thingâ€¦ Why don't we do this? Follow your own advice, and rethink your position in this world with rationality and common sense. Then reconsider all of this, and see what the calculations in your head add up to.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;He does travel astraly. The meaning is very simple about how he healed. It wasn't done with any devices from the future. the blind will see the dead will rise. It is all so very simple if you knew you would laugh and so ohh! how clever I would have never thought of that. but I cannot reveal that only he is allowed to tell you. Ask him and I bet he will show you.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Look, I won't resort to having to exploit what I know of my visions of Christ to make the case that he is a Time Traveler. But I will say this. Spend some time here thinking about Time Travel, and hearing others theories on it. Spend some time considering humanity's principles. And finally spend some time seeing how this all implicates freewill. Then maybe you'll sing a different tune, and realize what you were willing to have done to this world.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Look Clara, the only reason why your upset right now, is because people won't follow your interpretation of the numbers. Excuse me, but you didn't exactly win me over with your story.<br />
<br />
If that's what you believe to be true for your case, then go on believing it. Just don't expect everyone else to.<br />
<br />
Humanity will chose the path that is best, and hopefully not one where we will choose to be left ignorant.<br />
<br />
The only think you hate, is others questioning you. But it has to be done, or else we just accept and become like you.<br />
<br />
Just like the time you were in the car, and gave up 'claimed you power' you had it. You lost it, and laughed out of insanity, that you just couldn't take it anymore. <br />
<br />
You should have asked the questions that I asked: 'Is this ethical'? 'Does this justify it?' 'But what having people choose, and free-will?'<br />
<br />
Then you might have been able to come to this point knowing alittle bit more about who your dealing with, then what Solara brainwashed you to believe.<br />
<br />
'You will never stop us' is one of the few things it's said to me. Well I can sure well try <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
&lt;&lt;You are merely a man who does not wish to spend time learning anything.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Are you sure you are not the one guilty of that?<br />
<br />
Clara, a word of advice. Spend some time taking some Martial Arts Classes, I think it could help you. I don't think you truly comprehend what it means to be human anymore. To feel the surge of adrenaline and raw primal human instinct pump through your veins . Doing a little physical battle, is what you might need to understand what humanity really needs. And understand good and evil, and discipline your mind to not get so upset all the time when someone argues. <br />
<br />
Take Care,<br />

<br />
I have an interesting scenario to explain to you concerning seeing the double digits. Before you look up in faith to these numbers consider this.<br />
<br />
At work I have 2 different clocks that I look at.  One is on my computer as a screen saver and the other is on the telephone LED screen.<br />
<br />
I keep seeing the double digits constantly!!! Day after day!!! So I decided to fix the double crossing time traveling menaces!!!  I changed the clocks (18 minutes apart) so that they would not read the same exact time!  In doing so this is what happened.<br />
<br />
I would look at one clock and it would read 2:24pm and the other would read 2:42pm or 3:13pm on one clock and on the other 3:31pm or 4:35pm on one clock and on the other 4:53pm<br />
This went on throughout the whole day!<br />
<br />
They know I know its them!  Its just their way of playing a cat and mouse hide and seek game with me! They are trying to teach me that no matter how I attempt to deter them by altering the time they still have ultimate control!<br />
<br />
CONTROL WITH NO FREE WILL!!!<br />
<br />
CAT...</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">I am not trying to win anyone, whats to win anyway. I only ask shadow what he thought. Are we all to go to you TTA   before we speak or ask anyone a question. I have never met such a tyrant. You keep talking about free will then why don't you let others use theirs without you  having to critizize people. Shadow doesn't have to answer me that is his free will. You say you are trying to save people, from what? there is hardly anyone talking on this stream. Yes I guess we need you to save us from the evil monster lurking in space. From the boogie man in the closet or maybe from little green men. You who are so wise and clever and us poor little humans who can't think for ourselves need you to tell us what to do. Like I said this is a free world and I can say anything I want and yes you can say what you want to. go right ahead. I'm sure you will need to vent your anger towards me because you don't know what else to do with it. I am beginning to reaslize that that is your issue. You are mad at the world and everyone in it that doesn't agree with you. Thats such a horrible place to be. Well you will never win because we do have free will and I can listen to space people and little green men all I want and you can't do a damn thing about it.<br />
Just because your stuck in the numbers game doesn't mean everybody else is. Some of us are moving forward and we don't need you to tell us were making a mistake. So Shadow do as you please I am not trying to win you to anything. You know who you are.<br />

You said above &lt;there is hardly anyone talking on this stream.&gt;<br />
<br />
Thats because they are sitting back and reading all the facts!<br />
There is not anything more to say...<br />
<br />
Clara, I believe in G*D and I believe he is showing me the sceam of all things and the truth about what life is really all about.<br />
<br />
What &quot;facts&quot; have you supplied to plead your case that we really have free will?<br />
<br />
One cannot take a single step toward heaven without first grasping the universe and all its &quot;numerous&quot; parts. Its like walking into a library where the walls are covered to the ceilings with books in many different languages and subjects.  Its obvious to see that someone must have written all these books.  Maybe we dont understand the other languages in which they are written  But one can see a difinite plan in the arrangements of the books.  A mysterious order which one cannot comprehend but only dimly suspects. <br />
<br />
Clara, does this order suggest free will?<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">It depends how you look at it. Is  bin Laden using his free will? When you exercice your free will you  may just be hurting someone else or stopping them from using theirs. All things are allowed but in order to move from this reality you must learn to see differently. Unless people are taught how to use their free will for the benefit of all mankind then there will be more people like Bin Laden . The numbers gave me freedom because before I had no control now  I do. I know this is true because once I claimed my power I was not swayed by any ill wind that just so happened to blow  my way. We must learn to control ourselves not others. The numbers will change for you when you pass this milestone. but only if you want to. nobody is forcing you. Also which God do you talk to. I would be very careful who you call God they just may answer. also why don't you call your God and tell him to take the numbers away does he  not have the power to protect you from such. The numbers for me are from my friends who have claimed God status not to impose control but to help me learn how to live in a world that is mostly inhabited by darkness. It is my light that I may see. but what I see is my own behavior towards my fellow man . I can only change the world when I change myself. the free will part is that you may choose dark or light. It is your choice. but in order to see the light you must experience darkness. What doen't kill you only makes you stronger. My advice would be to start using the numbers to learn about yourself then everything will change for you . The numbers will transform and you will move on to the next adventure. But if this is not what you want it is your choice. Also how do you know that the god you pray to hasn't sent you these number  because you ask to be helped. Maybe its his or her way of moving you forward. Do you  think children like he lessons their teachers give them everyday, no I think not, but in the long run are students better in the future for having been taught by their teachers. You can learn this I am sure because I did and no you will not lose your free will. You seem to be so afraid of losing how do you know you will not gain if you never take the challenge. TTA thinks I am brainwashed and you may to but to me  I was a slave to myself and now   I have been freed. Here is a little message my friends told me to give you<br />
     There is a place where prisoners are kept in  solitary confinment. Sometimes the prisoners just show up missing.<br />
the prison Guards are puzzled as to how this is happening. They are so sure they have locked everyone in and there should be no means of escape but every now and then one is gone. But you see during the nite when the guards are asleep the shining ones walk through the walls and lead the prisoners to safety. occasionally prisoners become so afraid that they refuse to go with the shining ones they scream and holler because they are afraid it is a trick. The shining ones can do nothing to help them and must leave them in their confinement. It is very sad for the shining ones because they wish to free all such creatures from darkness. Well Suddenly a lot of prisoners were coming up missing. There were stories about these shining ones and the guards became concerned. They couldn't let all the prisoners escape because you see the guard knew nothing else but being guards. What on earth would they do with themselves. So the guards devised a plan. They would tell all the prisoner that the shining ones were evil and they would take them over the hill and eat them alive. They even told them that they had found the prisoners bones over the hill. The guards told the prisoners you must stay here where you are safe.  Well after that not many prisoners were rescued they were to afraid they would be eaten.This went on for many years and many died. The guards were happy that no one was coming up missing and their job was secure. The shining ones were sad so they divised a plan. They sent one of their own into the prison, which was very easy all he had to do was steal a loaf of bread. During the nite he would walk between  the walls and tell all the prisoners that they were being tricked that he had seen where  the shining ones  took them and it was a good place. Many prisoners believed and went with the shining ones but still many did not. to this day the prison still exist and the shining ones still do their nitely rescue. The only hope is that one day the guards will find something else to do with their time and decide to close the prison once and for all. Then the shining ones will be able to return to their own families knowing that no more prisoners need to be rescued.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Clara, sorry but it's not like that, I'm sorry you see it that way. I'm kinda in a hurry this Saturday, I have to get a few things done, before it gets to late. So I will not respond to your entire postâ€¦ just yet.<br />
<br />
But I will this one:<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I am not trying to win anyone, whats to win anyway.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
To win others to your 1 way cause. That's what's to win.<br />
<br />
And as I read in your second post, that's exactly what your trying to do.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I only ask shadow what he thought. Are we all to go to you TTA before we speak or ask anyone a question.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Again, you assume wrong about me. I only wish to have others listen to a 2 sided view of this. If I would to just allow your perspective to go unquestioned that would make you very happy and give only people 1 way of looking at it. And that is not the way to go about making decisions.<br />
<br />
As you can see how New Agers are so fanatical and will defend their alien masters to exploit us. You only see what you want to see. What's most convenient for your cause? Not the whole truth behind the agenda.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I have never met such a tyrant.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
That's critic. You avoid all disagreement, so you never really learned the term to call someone who doesn't agree with you. It's called a critic.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;You keep talking about free will then why don't you let others use theirs without you having to critizize people. Shadow doesn't have to answer me that is his free will.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
I can say the same to you. I wouldn't have to criticize you if you gave them more then 1 way of looking at it. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;You say you are trying to save people, from what? there is hardly anyone talking on this stream. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Just because no body is posting, that doesn't mean some aren't listening and reading. Some may be &quot;hmmm, which side sounds good for me to join.&quot; And that means all the difference in the world what someday people may sanction.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Yes I guess we need you to save us from the evil monster lurking in space. From the boogie man in the closet or maybe from little green men. You who are so wise and clever and us poor little humans who can't think for ourselves need you to tell us what to do. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Versus someone else who would rather have us accept this, and give up all human control to it, to something not yet fully comprehended. I feel that I understand what were up against, and am the best candidate to thus far to be the Activist against them. Someone has to speak on behalf of humanity, instead of wanting to sell it out.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Like I said this is a free world and I can say anything I want and yes you can say what you want to. go right ahead.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Thank you, I will. No need to throw a tantrum <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I'm sure you will need to vent your anger towards me because you don't know what else to do with it.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
OKâ€¦<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I am beginning to reaslize that that is your issue.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
You should be a fortune tellerâ€¦ your as phony as Miss Cleo and her and New Jersey/I mean Jamaican accent.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;You are mad at the world and everyone in it that doesn't agree with you.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
I am mad at the world if they become like you and #$*&amp; it up.<br />
<br />
How many more times must I make my case to you Clara for you to understand it. I want everyone, meaning everyone, to live free. Not for one group to come out of the ground and enslave it, and cause all of our principles of freedom and independence to go to hell.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Thats such a horrible place to be.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Tell me about it. I seen what you people can do.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Well you will never win because we do have free will and I can listen to space people and little green men all I want and you can't do a damn thing about it.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Your cockiness will be your un-doing. Don't under estimate humanity. You still have a lot to learn Clara. And your proud attitude is keeping you from listening to someone who isn't a part of your New Age sect.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Just because your stuck in the numbers game doesn't mean everybody else is.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Well it just so happens I only had the double digits 1 time this week. I am devising trail and error techniques against them. Understanding universal principles in my mind, I am learning how to resist and defend what little remains of my patience against them... Taking my self out of synch with them, and creating reality against them, they not very pleased about that, I can feel that. I have learned to resist them (to an extent) and will continue to defy them. <br />
<br />
I am the TimeTravelActivist, that is who I am. Humanities freedom fighter, Time Police and dedicated friend. I will never sell out my friendsâ€¦ NEVER!<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Some of us are moving forward and we don't need you to tell us were making a mistake.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
So you admit it then, you are making a mistake? Why drive everyone to it too? Me or any other activist (critic) telling everyone the truth behind this will save lives, and bring them to understanding. Moving forward, but at a cost of human freewill. You New Agers always leave that out of the brochures, why not tell them the way it is. And see if they still come willingly.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
TTA</div>

<br />
You are treating the number phenomna as if it were messages being sent. Maybe they are messages maybe they are not messages.<br />
<br />
A message implies a conscious SENDER. Too, it is the interpritation of the recieved data that determins what message is recieved. In other words it is the reciever who realizes &gt;A&lt; message content, and he must then guess at the motives of the sender. Wrong! You've just fallen into the same trap again because by trying to decern motive you have accepted the premise that there is a sender at all. It is possible that the number coincidences are dormant inanimate structures imbedded in the structure of time itself. How you choose to interpret, ignore or act on them is a choise you must make on your own, in real time.<br />
<br />
The numbers just turn out to be segments of synchronisity that you happen to notice. The question becomes &quot;how should one chose to deal with the phenomena of synchronisity in their lives&quot;?<br />
<br />
Is synchronisity working for us or against us? I have definitly seen it go BOTH ways. I believe that the psychicly gifted and the psychicly cursed will have opposite experiances in this reguard. The less informed just call it luck. If they are observent and build their own good karma they will do just as well as the rest of us.<br />
<br />
This does NOT mean that there are not malevolent miscreants and and angels in the psychic-spiritual-time realm screwing around with our best and worst efforts. It just means that one should be warry of &quot;gittin their ass bit off.&quot; Self rightous bickering ain't gonna help anything.</div>

<br />
today I went to see the movie The Mothman Prophecies.  ITS BASED ON TRUE EVENTS!!!  I REPEAT TRUE EVENTS!!! <br />
<br />
Numbers and dates and their relationship to worldly disasters play a strong message in this movie! It also gives a strong perspective of other unseen entities and their control over us.  The movie confirmed what I already knew.<br />
<br />
Throughout the whole movie I had chills on the back of my neck!  because coinciently everything that we have been discussing in this forum is linked to the movie!  My interpretation of the MOTHMAN is the angel of death. He is a manipulator and time traveler!<br />
<br />
This is a &quot;must see&quot; for you Clara!!!<br />
<br />
Clara am I suposed to have some insite on that message a friend gave you for me?  Because I dont have a clue how it relates to me? <br />
<br />

 Yes I agree with you shadow maybe it is in our DNA and our thoughts trigger the process. I have noticed that when I have positive thoughts the numbers become more positive. Negative thoughts and the numbers tend to show me trouble. Could it be that our thoughts create our reality. Also seeing the numbers could be a blessing. Do you think Bin laden sees numbers and if he did would it have given him a chance to change what he did. Well of course he must have been having negative thoughts Right, <br />
and he did not want to change what he did because in his mind what he did was right. so that being the fact can we still depend on what we think is right and wrong. seems that just doesn't work anymore. so the numbers give us a chance to move beyond right and wrong which brings us back to choice. I think the trick is not to get in the negative or positive but to balance the two. Black and white mixed together makes GREY do they not. When you make choices based in grey there is no duality. let me give you and example of this. If I get into an argument with someone in the past I thought that someone had to win, well usually nobody wins. So instead of fighting and giving away all that energy. I just make the    choice not to go there. I let the other person say what they want and just move on. since I have been on this post TTA has given me a lot of practice. He does want to fight with me but I love him and know that neither one of us will win because its a no win situation. But TTA I still value your opinion and will read what you have to say as long as it doesn't become a battle between us because I need my energy for living not fighting. So by all means state your opinion and let me state mine.<br />
Thank you TTA for given me the chance to grow. angels are light and demons are dark but when you mix  the two you get GREY.</div>

 <br />
you must make your own interpretation. It is for you to ponder. <br />
but only if you choose to. I am going to see that movie you <br />
mentioned it looks pretty cool. I Will let you know what I think. besides the numbers what other coincidences have you had. I will tell you one: several years ago when I was seeing the numbers I had a bizarre experience losing my purse. I went to the movies and left my purse in the seat. I got it back but all the money was stolen. a couple of weeks later I left it on the back of my car and drove off. When I did it flew in this parking lot of a second hand store. I got home and was so mad my husband was even madder because  I had credit cards and some money in it. Well I was seeing numbers at the time and keep telling my husband that something was strange. At that point I did not beleive it was just random. The next day this nice man called and said he found my purse. He actually brought it to my house. I gave him a $20.00 reward he was so nice. Then about a month later my husband and I were on a trip and I left my purse in a large candy shop. We left and got an hour from that shop before I realized my purse was gone. My husband was so mad at me he thought I was losing it (ha,ha) no pun intended. Well we drove all the way back to get it. When I got there The people in the store told me that a man had found it that lived in gulf shores<br />
I lived in pensacola florida at the time, I guess you all know about the ufo sighting there.Yes I lived in gulf Breeze when all that was going on. I have talked to the guy who wrote gulf breeze sighting, but thats another story. We decided to go back home and forget about the trip. I went home and waited, by this time I knew that I was not making me loose my purse something was trying to tell me something. When I got home that nite a man called and said he had may purse. WE drove to gulf shores to pick it up. He was very nice and I was glad to have it back for the 3rd time. Well I know something was up so I figured if  what ever it was could make me loose my purse then they could also talk to me so I said Go ahead tell me whats up. This was the answer: The three people who had my purse represented the 3 types of people on the earth the first one stole my money, the second one went out of his way to help me and bring it back, the third one gave it back to me but didn't go out of his way to help. Then there was a second message it said lose it you'll get it back. I knew that meant my house. That was hard because I had a nice house with a swimming pool. But I knew I had to move because I felt like I was in danger somehow living in florida. Thats why I lost my purse you see, lose it you'll get it back. Lose this lifestyle this house and go where we tell you and you will be fine and get it back. I did and now I live somewhere else and I'm fine and don't have that feeling anymore of being in danger. I have another nice house and have meet the nicest people in the world. so maybe in the future I will know why I wasn't safe in florida. Will I thank the numbers and losing my purse, you bet.  I know they made it happen 3 times in order to get my attention, 3's a charm. So when something bad happens don't look at it as just them driving you crazy they are probably trying to tell you something you just have to be smart enough to figure out the message. The trick is stay calm You can't get the message if you get all upset. My husband went crazy , losing your purse is a serious thing I knew something was up and I needed to listen. Maybe it was angels or alien or my friends from space or maybe I'm phychic and was feeling uneasy because subconsciously I knew I was in danger Maybe my subconscious was sending me a message who knows.<br />
I just know now I'm glad I left. Florida has dangerous energy.<br />
I hope you guys don't live in Florida.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Wow, you guys are good, I think u should write a book or something. Well, back to the topic, like my name says I am a tt, do you believe me? Probably not. Things are not to believe, they are to understand. There are a lot of poofs that time travel exists (archaeological for example), but there's this gap between people conciousness and facts. And about free will, the only thing that gives you freedom is your overall consciousness and most people on earth dont even know their own ignorance (that's true lack), you're being controlled by everything that's above your perception. cya <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /></div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">Its funny you should say above your perception. I was just thinking of that today. suppose this, what if something entered your room and you couldn't see it with your eyes. Say it was telepathic and you were telepathic too   you just didn't know it. Could it not tell you something and you would think it was your own thoughts. So what if this thing were bad and told you  to do something. YOu would actually think that you were thinking this right. Well maybe the numbers are trying to warn you that something is in your range that you cannot see . How can you fight something if you cannot see it. You would need some system that is in your perception to warn you of this intruder. With all the beings out of their bodies how do we know who is invading your space. Take this for example. Jeffery Daumer the killer said he heard voices right. They said he had mental problems. Maybe he was telepathic and really was hearing something talk to him. poor guy and nobody could help him.Have you read stephen Kings book called dreamcatcher it is kinda like this. When I first got into all this stuff. I meet this man who said he was a healer. Well he wasn't but he was interested in out of body travel. He ask me on several occasion if I had seen him at my house out of his body. the fact was yes I was seeing him in my dreams. Now I don't think I was dreaming. I started not liking this man but he would pop into my thoughts just out of the blue. I  started having sexual thought of this man and that  scared me because he was very unattractive and I'm married anyway. I started feeling his presence more and more frequently.  I became very annoyed and when I saw him he would ask me about being out of his body. The only thing I could do to stop him was to put up a mental gaurd. Every time I would feel his presence I would mentally put an X  over his face. I also sheilded  all the opening in my house by mentally projecting a barrier he could not cross. After just a week he started to fade. From then on every time he would ask me if I had seen him I would tell him no. It worked and now he is completely gone from my presence. This is called phycic defense. It can be very useful in the presence of something you cannot see. Maybe all these people who are doing all these random killings are really being controlled they just don't know it. Get this the day I meet the man that I spoke of I saw numbers also when I found his card in a chiropractic office because he was advertising himself as a healer I saw numbers. But the expeience taught me a lesson and led me to learn phycic defense so it wasn't all bad.<br />
Sorry about the spelling I probably need to learn that too. If more people were aware of this maybe we wouldn't have so much mayhem going on down here. I do know that American indians use lots of devices for phychic defense and I recently had a friend make me a dreamcatcher. But be careful don't buy one unless you know the person that made it is pure at heart. I do beleive some Indians put curses on them and then sell them to white people. I know you think I'm crazy. Well I thought people were crazy to until I had my own experiences. sorry I got off the subject we were suppose to be talking about time travel.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Clara,<br />
<br />
'What's to win over' you askedâ€¦?<br />
<br />
Is it not clear to you yet?<br />
<br />
How many followers do you think your New Age (Esoteric Christianity) site has?<br />
<br />
How many do you think you converted here, since a month ago?<br />
<br />
Now picture this: Multiply that number x100,000<br />
<br />
Now what do you get?<br />
<br />
You get thousands, perhaps millions of New Age followers, who will rather devastate the past and allow to be exploited by aliens. <br />
<br />
That's what to win over. And that is, what my mission is to stop. The way you people live your life and expect everyone else to, and misinterpret the New Testament is a crime against humanity.<br />
<br />
This is not a game Clara, this is serious. Thousands of lives are awaiting for answers, and your not giving them a 2 sided view to choose. Your prying on their fascination with Spiritualism, and are selling them out to a future where Time is used for Spiritual growth. <br />
<br />
Completely forgetting that it's wrong, and that it's exploiting humanity to do it.<br />
<br />
You take a human imagination, you take a person soul, and twist it and make it buy into this wonderful life, that your making them picture. But why don't you tell them that they have to give up their control to your Alien Masters. <br />
<br />
People, have you learned nothing about the Heaven's Gate Cult?<br />
<br />
Their New Age ideas are no different then Clara's and Solara's. <br />
<br />
They want a new life in a new world for everyone. Are you going to be willing to sacrifice your children to it, and make them grow up in a Earth where 1 sided views counter reason and human principles?<br />
<br />
As if this Nation isn't sissy enough, making compromises for every little group out there.<br />
<br />
Cults grow, and intent to shape this nation as their own. Their fanatical followers are scattered everywhere in our society, especially on the internet: In news forums (i.e. Clara), in other places of worship sites, in politics sites. Disseminating their 1 sided view and gaining supporters. Completely being biased towards anyone who does not see them as the 1 true faith, and path to God.<br />
Clara, your such an open person to all this New Age munbo jumbo stuff, just because you feel it's the way to be. You believe everything you hear and read. Your so into speculation, not into facts and reason, or critical thinking.<br />
<br />
That's what will be our downfallâ€¦ For if everyone becomes like you, and accept this, the TimeTravelActivist will be unable to stop the chain reaction you people have done.<br />
<br />
Trying to educate a mass of people who want this doctrine and fantasize about it as the gospel truth, well there is very little reaching them. <br />
<br />
And sometimes, it's better to just give up and let them have the world. Allow them to make the mistake and take innocents along with them. Then maybe, someday the tables will turn, and understand what the TimeTravelActivist tried to tell them centuries before this happened.<br />
<br />
More later,<br />
<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Though TTA and I have disagreed on certain issues in the past few days, I am going to agree with him on this one.<br />
<br />
Since the beginning of the modern christian age, to me, the religion takes on a cult-like appearence.<br />
<br />
This can not be expressed stronger than with the recent rise of new-age, end-of-times christian wackos.<br />
<br />
The most disturbing thing to me is the fact that they use the most touchy issue of human life (death, life-after etc.) and exploit our &quot;fear&quot; of it.  They tell us, Join the cult little children (confess, accept Jesus) or, God will damn you to hell (but he still loves you).  Who can say no to that?  A lot of death row inmates can't.  I've noticed a lot of re-birth among those, being shown on the news.<br />
<br />
Christianity, and most religion has taken on a new form for me, and I offer this simple analogy to show the evolution of religion, and how it has become obsolete.<br />
<br />
A man, in the year X is working on a problem, he knows it will take a long time, but he must work on it.  But one morning, a mystery man comes to his door and tells him, &quot;I know the answer, it may not be right, it may be, do you accept it?&quot;  The man thinks, and realizes he can take the shortcut, preach it to the masses, and no one will know the difference, now he can retire to the bahamas.<br />
<br />
With our scientific discovery, religion has basically been disproven, we think we know where the universe came from.  We know we were created through the process of evolution.<br />
<br />
In the days when religion was created, the earth was the center of the universe, the earth was flat, we were the only thing in the universe, which we did not know existed.  And finally when we started to realize these facts, the Roman Catholic church outlawed such practices, because they knew the truth would hurt.<br />
<br />
Knowing this truth, how can we believe in religion anymore?  We can believe in it, because the cult leaders tell us to.  Scientific knowledge is now religion, because it gives us the true answer, the thoughtful answer, and not the quick way out.<br />
<br />
So I'm not hopping on the bandwagon, maybe I'll go to hell.<br />
<br />
If you believe in something, does it truly exist?<br />

Hell was invented by the church to scare you into submission. also I do not know any new agers who beleive in hell either. I have read no new age material that would  hold this view. The fact is I don't think you even know what new age is all about your just blowing smoke about something you ain't got a clue about. You go live it and learn it then you can come back here and inform everyone about your experience. You sound like the church when they told Galileo the world was flat. <br />

		"articleBody": "TTA and Shawdow,\n I will talk to you but please no name calling or I will not respond. Yes the numbers are hard but in no way as hard as what you will experience in the future without them. I will start by telling you my experience. I am married now for 17 years and have 2 children. The numbers started for me about  5 years ago. My husband has seen them for 14 years.  At the time I was going to church, a methodist church and had been for 10 years. When the numbers started I started hearing woices in church. I would leave every sunday in tears and very upset. The voice told me and I  quote \" This is not what I meant\" I assumed it was Jesus.\nSo I quite going to church. It was to much for me to handle. My husband was upset because he liked church and was very involved.\nAt that point I just didn't care. So I started staying home. The numbers became more numerous and I started looking for answers. One day in my back yard I said to Jesus if you exist you better tell me what the hell is going on or I am going to believe you are dead and buried. I was ready never to set foot in a church again. Well from then on I became telepathic. He would talk to me in my mind and tell me different things . I was very sick at the time so I ask him what was wrong. He led me to that information which is to bizzare to say here. I had to go through emotional healing work to cure myself it was not easy. He told me alot about sickness and why people are so sick and yes he introduced me to our alien brothers and sisters. Then he had to test me so I could claim my power. At first I thought I had met the devil himself but when I came to my senses I realized why he was being so hard on me. My husband and I were fighting about everything. I realized that every time I saw numbers we would fight or somebody would fight about something. I started using the numbers to condition myself to these events. I remember the first time I claimed my power. My family and I  were driving in the car and an argument broke out well I almost jumped right there and yelled myself but a few moments before I had seen the numbers so I knew what was coming. I just started laughing they looked at me like I was crazy. I was so proud of myself .It was my first lesson in self control.think a minute about the events that transpired around Jesus. He  did not loose control but those around him did Thats why he died. He showed them how mad they could get and they ended up killing him. they couldn't face their own demons so they took it out on him . Since then I use the numbers they don't use me. The world is going through a very tough time right now . You will need all the help you can get. It wont be easy for any of us. I have seen the future also but the things I have seen do not involve anyone having to travel through time. Humans are predictable to a certain extent. also there are those that can see from far away. looking down at he earth and know what events will transpire simply because they are out there and we are down here. There are certain things I cannot tell you because it is against universal law. You must learn for yourselves. Everybody is waiting for Jesus to return  The fact is he already has. remember he said he would come like a theif in the nite well thats true. He cannot save you it is against universal law but he can help you to save yourself. I have probably told you to much. But I am desperate to help you because I know what you are going through. My sources told me to tell you  that there are others who are using the number system and they are not good they use it as a signature for there work sort of like serial killers do. They always leave a message in there work. I think the events of 911 is just that, a signature.\nI know there are dark forces I have experienced them. The only way to stop them is to learn self control. Use the numbers to learn about yourself and whats going on. The only way dark forces can use you is if you let them. They cannot harm you or anyone else if you learn self control. I know its hard but you can do it. Once you get control the numbers will change in order to help you. They may ask you to move to a safe location. they may ask you to tell someone something Like I am doing now.Believe me I would never hurt anyone but the future depends on us following through. If this earth falls to dark forces it may be hundreds of thousands of years before we get another chance. If you allow yourself to move forward and learn this then maybe I will be given permission to tell you more. If you choose not to I will accept that and move on. It is your choice and I cannot take that from you. I would like to ask you to rethink your position on Jesus he is not a time traveler. He does travel astraly. The meaning is very simple about how he healed. It wasn't done with any devices from the future. the blind will see the dead will rise. It is all so very simple if you knew you would laugh and so ohh! how clever I would have never thought of that. but I cannot reveal that only he is allowed to tell you. Ask him and I bet he will show you. \n                                Clara",
