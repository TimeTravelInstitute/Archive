								<div class="bbWrapper">The ancient traditions and scriptures from different continents talk about a <br />
<br />
race of serpent beings endowed with superhuman powers. The scriptural and <br />
<br />
folkloric resources are used to present more complete picture of them and <br />
<br />
their ancient and recent interaction with humans.<br />
<br />
There has been an unprecedented increase of interest in UFO and <br />
<br />
paranormal issues in official media. Some consider this to be a result of <br />
<br />
leaks from the intelligence community. The fact is that there has been wide <br />
<br />
and profound change of public attitude in this regard. An example of this is <br />
<br />
how the alien image underwent a significant change during the years, from the <br />
<br />
ridiculed &quot;little green men&quot; of the cartoons in the early fifties to the <br />
<br />
classical &quot;grays&quot; as benevolent &quot;space brothers&quot; in seventies. Later, however, <br />
<br />
they have become more and more malicious and associated with the phenomena of <br />
<br />
cattle mutilation and human abduction. This picture is probably the one most <br />
<br />
often associated with the word &quot;aliens&quot; nowadays.<br />
<br />
But in the past few years there appeared a new type of aliens: the <br />
<br />
&quot;reptilians&quot; (also called &quot;reptoids,&quot; &quot;sauroids&quot; etc.). The media and market <br />
<br />
became flooded by reptile/dragon/dinosaur characters. The entertainment <br />
<br />
industry made them almost omnipresent, from children toys and cartoons to most <br />
<br />
successful movies. This phenomena is analyzed to some extent in the file The <br />
<br />
Cult of the Serpent and others. Several &quot;alien files&quot; available on the internet present a compilation of manifold information about aliens <br />
<br />
in earth's history, presence and possible future as well as many of the <br />
<br />
related incidents regarding space and underground explorations. They also <br />
<br />
include quotations from various scriptures including the Bible and the Vedas. <br />
<br />
The term &quot;Veda,&quot; literally &quot;knowledge,&quot; the indologists usually apply <br />
<br />
to the four Vedas: Rg, Sama, Yajur and Atharva. However, in broader sense, it <br />
<br />
is also used for the related literature as the Puranas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, <br />
<br />
Itihasas etc. The fact that in these files the reptilians are associated with the Nagas of <br />
<br />
the ancient Vedic tradition is one of the reasons I have decided to write this <br />
<br />
article. <br />
<br />
Saurian Connection: Historical Background of the Serpent<br />
<br />
The snake (serpent spirit) has been a symbol of wisdom, eternity, healing, <br />
<br />
mystery, magical power, and holiness throughout most of the ancient <br />
<br />
non-western world. Its symbol is used today in medicine, and other healing <br />
<br />
professions, and its live descendants are hailed as sacred and used in <br />
<br />
everything from cancer drugs to sex potions. Serpent was worshiped in ancient <br />
<br />
Babylon, Mexico, Egypt, as well as many other places all over the world.<br />
<br />
The following passage is written by Soror Ourania (from &quot;Thelemix and Therion <br />
<br />
Rising&quot;) from the Gnostic point of view.<br />
<br />
&quot;The word Naga is rooted in Sanskrit and means &quot;serpent.&quot; &lt;Further meanings <br />
<br />
from the Sanskrit-English Dictionary by Monier Monier-Williams: m. &quot;not <br />
<br />
moving,&quot; a mountain (in Atharva Veda); the number 7 (because of the 7 <br />
<br />
principal mountains; any tree or plant (in Mahabharata); the sun.&gt; In the East <br />
<br />
Indian pantheon it is connected with the Serpent Spirit and the Dragon Spirit. <br />
<br />
It has an equivalence to the Burmese Nats, or god-serpents. In the Esoteric <br />
<br />
Tradition it is synonymous for Adepts, or Initiates. In India and Egypt, and <br />
<br />
even in Central and South America, the Naga stands for one who is wise.<br />
<br />
&quot;The &lt;buddhist philosopher&gt; Nagarjuna of India, for example, is shown with an <br />
<br />
aura, or halo, of seven serpents which is an indication of a very high degree <br />
<br />
of Initiation. The symbolism of the seven serpents, usually cobras, are also <br />
<br />
on Masonic aprons or certain systems in the Buddhist ruins of Cambodia <br />
<br />
(Ankhor) and Ceylon. The great temple-builders of the famous Ankhor Wat were <br />
<br />
considered to be the semi-divine Khmers. The avenue leading to the Temple is <br />
<br />
lined with the seven-headed Naga. And even in Mexico, we find the &quot;Naga&quot; which <br />
<br />
becomes &quot;Nagal.&quot; In China, the Naga is given the form of the Dragon and has a <br />
<br />
direct association with the Emperor and is known as the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;... <br />
<br />
while in Egypt the same association is termed &quot;King-Initiate.&quot; The Chinese are <br />
<br />
even said to have originated with the Serpent demi-gods and even to speak <br />
<br />
their language, Naga-Krita. For a place that has no serpents, Tibet, they are <br />
<br />
still known in a symbolic sense and are called &quot;Lu!&quot; (Naga). Nagarjuna called <br />
<br />
in Tibetan, &lt;becomes&gt; Lu-trub.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the Western traditions we find the same ubiquity for the Naga, or Serpent. <br />
<br />
One simple example is the Ancient Greek Goddess, Athena. She is known as a <br />
<br />
warrior Goddess as well as the Goddess of Wisdom; her symbol being the Serpent <br />
<br />
as displayed on her personal shield. Of course, in Genesis the Serpent is a <br />
<br />
Naga who instructs the new infant (humanity) in what is called the Knowledge <br />
<br />
of Good and Evil. The Christian church has, unfortunately transformed the <br />
<br />
Initiate-Teacher into a tempting and negative demon-character. An apocryphal <br />
<br />
tradition says that Apollonius of Tyana, while on a visit to India, was taught <br />
<br />
by the &quot;Nagas&quot; of Kashmir. (See The Life of Apollonius, by Philostratos) It is <br />
<br />
felt by many scholars of the Western Tradition that the life of Apollonius was <br />
<br />
taken from the New Testament, or that the narratives of the New Testament have <br />
<br />
been taken from the life of Apollonius. This is felt because of the undisputed <br />
<br />
and clear similarities of construction of that particular narrative.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naga is one of a handful of rare words surviving the loss of the first <br />
<br />
universal language. In Buddhism, Wisdom has always been tied, symbolically, to <br />
<br />
the figure of the Serpent. In the Western Tradition it can be found as used by <br />
<br />
the Christ in the Gospel of Saint Matthew (10:16), &quot;Be ye therefore wise as <br />
<br />
serpents, and harmless as doves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In all mythological language the snake is also an emblem of immortality. Its <br />
<br />
endless representation with its tail in its mouth (Ouroboros), and the <br />
<br />
constant renewal of its skin and vigor, enliven the symbols of continued youth <br />
<br />
and eternity.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Serpent's reputation for positive medicinal and/or life-preserving <br />
<br />
qualities have also contributed to the honors of the Serpent as STILL seen by <br />
<br />
the employment of the caduceus &lt;staff around which two snakes are wrapped&gt;. To <br />
<br />
this very day, the Hindus are taught that at the end of every Universal <br />
<br />
Manifestation (Kalpa) all things are re-absorbed into Deity during the <br />
<br />
interval between &quot;creations.&quot; He reposes upon the Serpent Shesha (Duration) <br />
<br />
who is called Ananta, or Endless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indoeuropean (Slavic) folklore<br />
<br />
The Slavic folklore often mentions snakes as the guards of treasures hidden <br />
<br />
underground or in caves closely following the Vedic tradition. Some of the <br />
<br />
snakes are said to possess a crown which is an interesting detail as we will <br />
<br />
see later.<br />
<br />
Although one may be tempted to discount the folklore as unreliable source <br />
<br />
there is certain evidence which seems to support it.<br />
<br />
Czech herpetologist Jiri Hales writes in his book &quot;Moji pratele hadi (&quot;My <br />
<br />
friends, the snakes&quot;) about his travels around eastern Slovakia in '70 in <br />
<br />
search of unusually great snakes and mentions several interesting accounts he <br />
<br />
heard from the local people. One even involves a military unit which was <br />
<br />
called to destroy an alleged 15 ft long snake. (Snakes of such length are <br />
<br />
unknown in this part of the world.) Another account pertains to a ranger who <br />
<br />
noticed a number of snakes in the forest crawling in one direction and out of <br />
<br />
curiosity followed them. Thus he has come upon a great &quot;snake king&quot; with a <br />
<br />
crown on his head surrounded by many snakes. Scared, he quickly left that <br />
<br />
place. Other accounts involve small children who claimed to play with great <br />
<br />
snakes and even communicate with them. Hales concludes that these accounts are <br />
<br />
credible as they include many details which a layman could not possibly make <br />
<br />
up without personal experience.<br />
<br />
North America: Hopi tribal tradition<br />
<br />
The Hopi legend is that there were two races, the children of the feather who <br />
<br />
came from the skies, and the children of the reptile who came from under the <br />
<br />
earth. The children of the reptile chased the Hopi Indians out of the earth. <br />
<br />
These evil under-grounders were also called Two Hearts.<br />
<br />
The Hopi Indian Legend of Creation tells of three different beginnings. One <br />
<br />
story says that Hopi have arisen from an underground paradise through an <br />
<br />
opening called Sipapu. The underground paradise was wondrous with beautiful <br />
<br />
clear skies and plentiful food sources &lt;cf bila-svarga&gt;. It was because of the <br />
<br />
existence of those called Two Hearts, the bad ones, that refuge was sought in <br />
<br />
the upper world by the Hopi, the peaceful ones. The underworld was not <br />
<br />
destroyed but was only sealed up to prevent the Two Hearts from rising upon to <br />
<br />
the surface world.<br />
<br />
The second story tells of the descent of the Hopi from the Blue Star of a <br />
<br />
constellation called the Seven Sisters. One version tells of their travel to <br />
<br />
earth on the back of Enki, the eagle. Grandfather, the Great Spirit, allowed <br />
<br />
the first man to select his home from the many stars of the universe. Enki <br />
<br />
told first man of his home earth, and brought him to visit. First man's <br />
<br />
exploration of the earth convinced him that this was where he wanted his <br />
<br />
children to be born and to grow. First Man returned to the heavens to tell <br />
<br />
Grandfather of his decision. Grandfather was pleased and granted to first man <br />
<br />
the right to call earth his home. First man soon returned to the green place <br />
<br />
or Sakwap with his family shortly afterwards. (Many of the hero stories <br />
<br />
throughout time and through many different cultures refer to a valiant group <br />
<br />
of seven.)<br />
<br />
These two legends remind of the story of Kashyapa Muni and his two wives, <br />
<br />
Kadru, the mother of serpents, and Vinata, the mother of Garuda, the divine <br />
<br />
eagle, mentioned later.<br />
<br />
Western Africa<br />
<br />
The Legend of Da<br />
<br />
The world was created by Nana-Buluku, the one god, who is neither male nor <br />
<br />
female. In time, Nana-Buluku gave birth to twins, Mawu and Lisa, and it is <br />
<br />
they who shaped the world and control it still, with their fourteen children, <br />
<br />
the Vodou, or lesser gods.<br />
<br />
In the beginning, before Mawu had any children, the Rainbow Serpent, Da, <br />
<br />
already existed - created to serve Nana-Buluku. The creator was carried <br />
<br />
everywhere in Da's mouth. Rivers, mountains, and valleys twine and curve <br />
<br />
because that is how the Rainbow Serpent Da moves. Wherever they stopped for <br />
<br />
the night, mountains arose, formed from the serpent's dung. That is why if you <br />
<br />
dig down deep into a mountain, you find riches.<br />
<br />
Now, when Nana-Buluku had finished creating, it was obvious that the earth <br />
<br />
just couldn't carry everything - all the mountains, trees, peoples, and <br />
<br />
animals. So, to keep the earth from capsizing, the creator asked Da to coil <br />
<br />
beneath it to cushion it - like the pads the African women and girls wear on <br />
<br />
their heads when they are carrying a heavy load.<br />
<br />
Because Da cannot stand heat, the creator made the ocean for the serpent to <br />
<br />
live in. And there Da has remained since the beginning of time, with his tail <br />
<br />
in his mouth. Even though the water keeps Da cool, he sometimes shifts around <br />
<br />
trying to get comfortable, and that's what causes earthquakes.<br />
<br />
Nana-Buluku tasked the red monkeys who live beneath the sea to keep Da fed, <br />
<br />
and they spend their time forging the iron bars that are the serpent's food. <br />
<br />
But sooner or later the monkey's supply of iron is bound to run out, and then <br />
<br />
Da will have nothing to eat. Famished with hunger, he will start to chew on <br />
<br />
his own tail, and then his writhings and convulsions will be so terrible that <br />
<br />
the whole earth will tilt, overburdened as it is with people and things, and <br />
<br />
slip into the sea.<br />
<br />
This legend mentions the serpent serving the creator god. This serpent <br />
<br />
resembles Ananta Shesha, who serves Vishnu as a bed and supports the universal <br />
<br />
structure. They are both situated at the bottom of the universe on the great <br />
<br />
ocean called Garbhodaka.<br />
<br />
Scandinavia<br />
<br />
The Norse Ragnarok involves the destruction of the earth and the abodes of the <br />
<br />
Norse demigods (called Asgard). It is said that during Ragnarok the world is <br />
<br />
destroyed with flames by a being called Surt, who lives beneath the lower <br />
<br />
world (appropriately called Hel) and was involved in the world's creation. By <br />
<br />
comparison, the Bhagavata Purana (3.11.30) states that at the end of Brahma's <br />
<br />
day, &quot;the devastation takes place due to the fire emanating from the mouth of <br />
<br />
Sankarshana.&quot; Sankarshana (Ananta Shesha) is a plenary expansion of Krishna <br />
<br />
who is &quot;seated at the bottom of the universe&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 3.8.3), <br />
<br />
beneath the lower planetary systems.<br />
<br />
In the Norse lore there can be found more connections to the Vedic tradition <br />
<br />
but they go beyond the present topic.<br />
<br />
Tibet<br />
<br />
Tibetan Buddhist perspective of the Nagas comes from Cho-Yang's &quot;Year of Tibet <br />
<br />
Edition&quot;:<br />
<br />
&quot;Among all the creatures of the six realms, humans are the most fortunate, and <br />
<br />
have the best opportunity for attaining the ultimate achievement. Gods and <br />
<br />
demi-gods dwell in immeasurable happiness, exhausting the fruits of their <br />
<br />
positive karma, and are too distracted with worldly pleasure to seek <br />
<br />
liberation from cyclic existence. Hungry ghosts and hell beings are too <br />
<br />
disturbed with suffering and animals are too dumb. Humans, who enjoy both <br />
<br />
pleasure and pain are the only ones who can seek liberation. (...)<br />
<br />
&quot;Unseen forces are believed to be as numerous as those we can see: in every <br />
<br />
pond, forest, tree, house, dwell creatures big and small, important and humble <br />
<br />
which occasionally appear to humans in various forms, as well as in visions <br />
<br />
and in dreams.<br />
<br />
&quot;All these creatures are believed to be ruled by the protectors of the ten <br />
<br />
directions. These deities include gods from the Hindu pantheon such as Brahma <br />
<br />
and Indra. They are gods, and though they are immensely powerful and believed <br />
<br />
to control all the forces of the universe they are not beyond the wheel of <br />
<br />
cyclic existence and thus cannot be an object of refuge for humans aspiring <br />
<br />
for liberation. They may or may not be sympathetic to the Buddhist doctrine, <br />
<br />
but their help and cooperation can be cultivated and is considered essential, <br />
<br />
since they control all other non-human creatures, gods, demi-gods and ghosts. <br />
<br />
Tantric rituals always include an offering to them at the beginning to assure <br />
<br />
their non-interference.<br />
<br />
&quot;The creatures dwelling in individual places are called Sa-dag or land owners, <br />
<br />
or guardian deities. They belong to the realm of demi-gods or ghosts - not all <br />
<br />
ghosts are miserable creatures, some are wealthy and powerful demons. They may <br />
<br />
appear to people as ghosts, demons, or in dreams in an infinite variety of <br />
<br />
forms, including the human one and may either help or harm depending on their <br />
<br />
disposition. Many of the creatures in lakes, ponds and rivers are nagas, or <br />
<br />
serpent beings who belong to the animal realm. They sometimes appear in the <br />
<br />
form of snakes, or as half snakes and half humans with elaborate jeweled <br />
<br />
crowns. They are believed to be infinitely wealthy and to owe their present <br />
<br />
form to a previous life of unethical generosity. &lt;Comment: This is called <br />
<br />
bhogonmukhi-sukrti, or pious activities that bestow material opulence. They <br />
<br />
are of godless nature but involve kindness to other beings, with a view toward <br />
<br />
material happiness.&gt;<br />
<br />
&quot;Human activity is bound to encroach on the well-being of living creatures <br />
<br />
including those of other realms. Coming to a plot of land and inadvertently <br />
<br />
building a house, cutting trees or mining and digging natural resources will <br />
<br />
upset nagas and sa-dags just as it does animals and insects in such a <br />
<br />
situation. It is said that sa-dags and nagas equate the unauthorized use of <br />
<br />
land and natural resources they occupy to pilfering their personal <br />
<br />
possessions. The weaker ones among them will undergo great hardship or die <br />
<br />
off, while the more powerful will react with anger and strike back at the <br />
<br />
offenders, inflicting disease, death, and sudden catastrophe. They will not <br />
<br />
necessarily strike at the humans having committed the harm, as most cannot <br />
<br />
identify the actual offenders, but at any human they see, and innocent people <br />
<br />
may fall ill or die for no apparent reason, or the whole area be affected with <br />
<br />
epidemics or cases of leprosy.<br />
<br />
&quot;The following story was related by a Dema Locho Rinpochey, from Drepung, and <br />
<br />
occurred in the 1950s in Tibet. One day, one of the monks who was responsible <br />
<br />
for having the trees in the debating square watered, developed a large sore on <br />
<br />
his thigh. Suspecting it was caused by harm from nagas, he asked Rinpochey to <br />
<br />
consult an oracle in a nearby village - a nun who was possessed by nagas - to <br />
<br />
find out the cause of his illness. The naga, speaking through the oracle <br />
<br />
admitted having caused the harm: 'Yes, it was I who struck at that monk.' When <br />
<br />
Rinpochey asked the reason, it replied: 'I was angry at humans for other <br />
<br />
reasons and I saw this monk's luck was down and that he was vulnerable, so I <br />
<br />
caused him to develop this sore'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans are most vulnerable to nagas and sa-dags when their luck is low, as it <br />
<br />
is said that any weakness is immediately apparent to these other-worldly <br />
<br />
creatures. In order to avert unlucky circumstances which may bring one harm, <br />
<br />
people hang up strings of different prayer flags bearing the image of a horse. <br />
<br />
The 'wind-horse' or Lung-ta is the symbol of one's luck. The Tibetan <br />
<br />
expression 'His wind-horse is running' or 'is broken' refers to this luck, and <br />
<br />
the prayer flags fluttering in the wind, a tradition of Bon origin, is <br />
<br />
believed to give the upper hand to one's wind-horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since humans cannot survive without some form of land exploitation and <br />
<br />
building, Tibetans take certain measures to prevent unnecessary mishaps. While <br />
<br />
the hanging of prayer flags is like a general preventive measure, that of <br />
<br />
avoiding harm which has no direct cause, more particular measures are sought <br />
<br />
when any kind of digging is involved. Whenever choosing a site for building, <br />
<br />
whether for a mandala, temple or house, a lama is consulted as to the method <br />
<br />
by which the nagas and sa-dag on the site might be appeased and treated. The <br />
<br />
lama will know something about them either through dreams, divination or <br />
<br />
clairvoyance. According to Buddhist tantric practice, there are other ways of <br />
<br />
performing rituals. These are: peaceful, increasing, forceful and wrathful. <br />
<br />
The methods that apply to pacifying creatures of other realms are peaceful and <br />
<br />
wrathful, and the rituals used are extremely varied, in type as well as in <br />
<br />
tradition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally, in either case, a ritual based on sutra called Tashi Sojong is <br />
<br />
performed, to bring good luck and please the dwellers. If performing tantric <br />
<br />
rituals, the lama will offer tormas to the sa-dag or nagas abiding on the <br />
<br />
land. Tormas are conical-shaped offering cakes which have been blessed in <br />
<br />
three ways by a highly realized being by mantras, where they are purified from <br />
<br />
any defilements of ordinariness, by meditational stabilization, by which they <br />
<br />
are made infinite and by gestures, or mudras, which ensure that the recipient <br />
<br />
is satisfied. The idea of this ritual is to offer gifts to the sa-dag and <br />
<br />
nagas in exchange for use of their land. It is a deal, a give and take <br />
<br />
situation like selling a house, and if the 'sellers' are satisfied, things <br />
<br />
will proceed smoothly. There are some situations, however, where the land may <br />
<br />
be owned by particularly powerful sa-dags, who will not want to give in to <br />
<br />
humans and will do their utmost to create obstacles and harm. Such places are <br />
<br />
known as 'rough'. The spirits and demons inhabiting them will be unyielding in <br />
<br />
their views and generally delight in causing harm to human trespassers causing <br />
<br />
illness and bad dreams. If the lama examining the land sees such a situation, <br />
<br />
he will either declare the site unfit for building, or deal with the situation <br />
<br />
using the wrathful method.<br />
<br />
&quot;Through the possibilities are vast, the most commonly used wrathful method <br />
<br />
for clearing a site from negative forces, is the 'throwing of ritual cakes' <br />
<br />
which is like using a bomb to send harmful creatures to another existence. The <br />
<br />
motivation of the lama is one of compassion, and knowing that the purpose of <br />
<br />
the project is beneficial one and that the being causing the harm is <br />
<br />
accumulating negative karma, he will actually help it by transferring its <br />
<br />
consciousness to another realm where it will be of less harm to other beings. <br />
<br />
Only a person with a higher level of realization is qualified to perform such <br />
<br />
a ritual.<br />
<br />
&quot;When obstacles are removed, the Lu Thaye, a very powerful naga believed to be <br />
<br />
constantly moving under the ground is dealt with. Sudden digging would disturb <br />
<br />
him, but his movements in a particular spot can be plotted astrologically, and <br />
<br />
a spot on the plot can be found where no part of his body would be present at <br />
<br />
the time of the first, symbolic digging. This would be followed by offerings <br />
<br />
of ritual cakes to pacify him. This done, the building could proceed without <br />
<br />
further interference.<br />
<br />
&quot;In some cases, sa-dags and nagas not only take offense at encroachment on <br />
<br />
their land, but at harm inflicted on certain animals they feel are their own. <br />
<br />
The following is a story which took place about eighty years ago in a remote <br />
<br />
area of Kham. The head of a group of nomads, feeling he was above the law <br />
<br />
against hunting wild animals which prevailed in his land, one day decided to <br />
<br />
go shooting. He went off with his rifle and spotted a beautiful stag. He aimed <br />
<br />
at it, and saw something like a golden stirrup between its antlers. He put <br />
<br />
down his rifle and stared, but could see nothing. He aimed and put down his <br />
<br />
rifle two or three times, seeing the stirrup appear and disappear, hesitated, <br />
<br />
and finally shot. The stag was hit by the bullet but escaped, leaving a trail <br />
<br />
of blood. That night, the man returned home, unable to find the carcass of the <br />
<br />
animal he had hoped to kill and suddenly became very ill. As he lay dying, he <br />
<br />
related to his kin the incident with the stag, regretting he had shot it and <br />
<br />
mumbling he should have known better, seeing such an unusual object as a <br />
<br />
golden stirrup between its antlers. He died that very night and his family <br />
<br />
concluded he was the victim of a revengeful sa-dag to whom either the stag <br />
<br />
belonged to or of which he had taken the form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Incense and vase-offering rituals, which were routinely performed by the <br />
<br />
Tibetan government and also by private individuals and lamas were not only <br />
<br />
meant as a remedy in case of drought or other calamities, but also as a <br />
<br />
regular preventive measure to bring about positive conditions. Non-human <br />
<br />
creatures were known for their liking of fragrant smells, and the tradition of <br />
<br />
sang-so, which was originally practised by the Bon to appease and please local <br />
<br />
deities, was later practised by Buddhists for the same purpose. In the case of <br />
<br />
vase-offering rituals, vases were filled with different precious metals and <br />
<br />
cereals, blessed by mantras, meditative stabilization and gestures and placed <br />
<br />
in lakes or other places throughout the country where nagas were known to <br />
<br />
dwell, as a boon to them. These gifts could be likened to presents offered by <br />
<br />
the king of one country to that of another, aimed at pleasing the recipients <br />
<br />
who reciprocated with timely rain, pure water and a disease free environment. <br />
<br />
They had ways of showing their liking in particular ways. Dema Locho Rinpochey <br />
<br />
recalls a time when Drepung Loseling college decided to renovate a small <br />
<br />
retreat house on one of their estates, a few hours from Lhasa. The place had a <br />
<br />
spring and was known for its important naga and sa-dag population. The college <br />
<br />
called on Rinpochey to perform a ritual to keep the nagas out of the way <br />
<br />
during the time of the restoration work. This involved attracting them into a <br />
<br />
mirror which was transformed, by the lama's concentration, into a very <br />
<br />
pleasant abode in which they were asked to remain, as honoured guests, until <br />
<br />
their usual dwelling was once more fit to stay in. Rinpoche also offered a <br />
<br />
bathing ritual to the spring, purifying any defilements it would have <br />
<br />
undergone during the work. He said that the next morning, the caretaker <br />
<br />
pointed out that the water was much more abundant than usual, a sign that the <br />
<br />
nagas who dwelled in it were pleased.&quot;<br />
<br />
Middle East<br />
<br />
&quot;The possibility that an ancient reptilian-saurian race may exist below the <br />
<br />
surface of this planet is not an idea which is relatively new. This infernal <br />
<br />
yet physical race has been referred to in spiritual and historical records <br />
<br />
which date back to the beginning of time. Ancient Hebrew history, for <br />
<br />
instance, records that our human ancestors were not the only intelligent, <br />
<br />
free-will beings who inhabited the ancient world. Genesis chapter 3 refers to <br />
<br />
the &quot;Serpent,&quot; which according to many ancient Hebrew scholars was identified <br />
<br />
with a hominoid or bi-ped reptilian being. The ancient Hebrew word for <br />
<br />
&quot;Serpent&quot; is &quot;Nachash&quot; (which according to Strong's Comprehensive and other <br />
<br />
Biblical concordances contained in itself the meanings: Reptile, Enchantment, <br />
<br />
Hissing, Whisper, Diligently Observe, Learn by Experience, Incantation, Snake, <br />
<br />
etc. all of which may be descriptive of the serpent-sauroid race which we have <br />
<br />
been referring to). The original &quot;Nachash&quot; was not actually a &quot;snake&quot; as most <br />
<br />
people believe, but actually an extremely intelligent, cunning creature <br />
<br />
possessed with the ability to speak and reason. It also stood upright as we've <br />
<br />
said, as did many of it's descendants, the small &quot;saurian&quot; predators which <br />
<br />
ambled about on two legs.&quot; (from &quot;The Cult of the Serpent&quot; file, edited by <br />
<br />
Branton)<br />
<br />
In the book of Genesis Elohim punished the Serpent for deceiving Eve by <br />
<br />
ordering him to crawl on his stomach from that time on. They (Elohim) also <br />
<br />
created enmity between human and serpent race.<br />
<br />
The book of Revelation describes eschatological accounts when the enmity <br />
<br />
between human and serpent race escalates into an open conflict: &quot;...And there <br />
<br />
was war in heaven: Michael fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought <br />
<br />
and his angels... and the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called <br />
<br />
the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world...&quot; (Rev. 12<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite16" alt=":love:" title="Love    :love:" />)<br />
<br />
There are other interesting biblical references to serpents and dragons in <br />
<br />
Psalms 44:19, 74:13, 148<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite16" alt=":love:" title="Love    :love:" />, Issaiah 13:22, etc.<br />
<br />
India: Nagas of the Underworld<br />
<br />
The Nagas are a race of serpent beings. Most often they manifest themselves <br />
<br />
with half-man, half-serpent bodies, although sometimes they assume the shape <br />
<br />
of a dragon, or appear in the guise of a cobra. They can take many different <br />
<br />
forms including snakes, humans with snake tails and normal humans, often <br />
<br />
beautiful maidens. A precious gem is embedded in their heads endowing them <br />
<br />
with supernatural powers including invisibility. Some are demoniac, some <br />
<br />
neutral or sometimes helpful.<br />
<br />
Nagas are divided into four classes: heavenly, divine, earthly or hidden, <br />
<br />
depending upon their function in guarding the heavenly palace, bringing <br />
<br />
rainfall, draining rivers or guarding treasures.<br />
<br />
In Burma, the Nagas combine elements of the dragon, snake and crocodile. They <br />
<br />
have guarded and protected several royal Burmese personages. They also give <br />
<br />
rubies to those they favor.<br />
<br />
They inhabit lakes and rivers, but their real domain is a vast underground <br />
<br />
region called Bila-svarga, or subterranean heavens. There they guard great <br />
<br />
amounts of jewels and precious metals. Here they dwell with their seductive <br />
<br />
mates, the Naginis who sometimes seduce humans.<br />
<br />
One such account is to be found for example in the Mahabharata. Arjuna, the <br />
<br />
son of King Pandu, was &quot;abducted&quot; by Ulupi, the Naga princess who enamored <br />
<br />
him, into the parallel realm in the river Ganges near Hardwar. After spending <br />
<br />
a night with her and begetting a son called Iravan, he returned back. This <br />
<br />
incident is also mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana 9.22.32. R. Thompson in his <br />
<br />
book &quot;Alien Identities&quot; uses this account to give an example of parallel <br />
<br />
dimensions.<br />
<br />
The Mahabharata story follows:<br />
<br />
&quot;When his residence was thus crowded with divinity, the darling son of Pandu <br />
<br />
and Kunti then went down into the Ganges water, to be consecrated for holy <br />
<br />
rite. Taking his ritual bath and worshiping his forefathers, Arjuna, happy to <br />
<br />
take his part in the rite of fire, was rising out of the water, O king, when <br />
<br />
he was pulled back in by Ulupi, the virgin daughter of the serpent king, who <br />
<br />
could travel about at her will and was now within those waters. Holding onto <br />
<br />
him, she pulled him down into the land of the Nagas, into her father's house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arjuna then saw in the most honorable house of the Naga king, whose name was <br />
<br />
Kauravya, a carefully attended fire. Dhananjaya Arjuna, son of Kunti, took <br />
<br />
over the duty of the fire, and without hesitation he made the offering and <br />
<br />
satisfied the sacred flames. Having done the duty to the fire, the son of <br />
<br />
Kunti then said laughingly to the daughter of the Naga king, &quot;Why have you <br />
<br />
acted so boldly, O shy and beautiful woman? What is the name of this opulent <br />
<br />
land? Who are you and whose daughter are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ulupi said: &quot;There is a serpent named Kauravya, born in the family of <br />
<br />
Airavata. I am his daughter, O Partha, and my name is Ulupi, lady of the <br />
<br />
snakes. I saw you, Kaunteya, when you went down into the waters to take your <br />
<br />
ritual bath, and I was stunned by Cupid. O Kuru child, now that the god of <br />
<br />
love has stirred me up so, you must welcome me, for I have no one else, and I <br />
<br />
have given myself to you in a secluded place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arjuna said: &quot;Dharmaraja Yudhisthira has instructed me to practice celibacy <br />
<br />
for twelve months, and I agreed; thus I am not my own master. I would like to <br />
<br />
please you, but I have never spoken an untruth. How can I avoid a lie and also <br />
<br />
please you, snake woman? If it could be done without hurting my religious <br />
<br />
principles, then I would do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ulupi said: &quot;I understand, son of Pandu, how you are wandering the earth, and <br />
<br />
how your elder brother has instructed you to practice celibacy: &quot;There will be <br />
<br />
a mutual accord that if any one of us mistakenly intrudes upon the others <br />
<br />
during their time with Drupada's daughter, then he must remain in the forest <br />
<br />
for twelve months as a celibate brahmacari.&quot; That was the agreement you all <br />
<br />
made. But this exile you agreed upon is in regards to Draupadi. You all <br />
<br />
accepted the religious vow to be celibate in relation to her, and so your <br />
<br />
religious vow is not violated here with me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your eyes are very big and handsome, and it is your duty to rescue those who <br />
<br />
are in pain. Save me now, and there will be no breach of your religious <br />
<br />
principles. And even if there is some very subtle transgression of your <br />
<br />
religious principles, then let this be religious rule, Arjuna, that you gave <br />
<br />
me back my life. My lord, accept me as I have accepted you, for it will be an <br />
<br />
act approved by decent people; And if you will not accept me, then know that I <br />
<br />
am a dead woman. O strong-armed one, practice the greatest virtue, which is <br />
<br />
the act of giving life. I come to you now for shelter, for you are an ideal <br />
<br />
man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaunteya, you always take care of the poor and helpless people, and I have <br />
<br />
gone straight to you for shelter and am crying out in pain. I beg you, for my <br />
<br />
desire is so strong. Therefore you must please me by giving yourself; it is <br />
<br />
proper for you to make me a satisfied woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sri Vaisampayana said: &quot;Thus addressed by the virgin daughter of the serpent <br />
<br />
lord, the son of Kunti, basing his actions on the religious law, did for her <br />
<br />
all that she desired. The fiery hero Arjuna spent the night in the palace of <br />
<br />
the Naga king, and when the sun rose he too rose up from Kauravya's abode.&quot;<br />
<br />
Similar story is recorded in the Harivansha, which is the addendum to the <br />
<br />
Mahabharata. Yadu, the founder of the Yadava family, went for a trip to the <br />
<br />
sea, where he was carried off by Dhumavarna, king of the serpents, to the <br />
<br />
capital of the serpents. Dhumavarna married his five daughters to Yadu, and <br />
<br />
from them sprang seven distinct families of people.<br />
<br />
Kumudvati, the Naga princess, married Kusha, the son of Rama, as described in <br />
<br />
the scripture Raghuvansha.<br />
<br />
The following account touches upon the issue of underground hominoid-sauroid <br />
<br />
conflicts.<br />
<br />
The Vishnu Purana speaks about the Gandharvas, descendants of sage Kashyapa <br />
<br />
and his wife Muni. Therefore they are also called Mauneyas. (According to <br />
<br />
Hindu Dictionary by Manurishi Foundation, the Mauneyas are a class of <br />
<br />
Gandharvas, who dwell beneath the earth, and are sixty millions in number.) <br />
<br />
They were fighting with the Nagas in the subterranean regions, whose dominions <br />
<br />
they seized and whose treasures they plundered. The Naga chiefs appealed to <br />
<br />
Vishnu for relief, and He promised to appear in the person of Purukutsa, son <br />
<br />
of King Mandhata, to help them. Thereupon the Nagas sent their sister Narmada <br />
<br />
to this Purukutsa, and she conducted him to the regions below, where he <br />
<br />
destroyed the Gandharvas. (According to the Ramayana similar Gandharvas were <br />
<br />
defeated by Bharata, the brother of Rama, and Hanuman.) The ninth khanda of <br />
<br />
the Bhagavata Purana also briefly mentions this story.<br />
<br />
The Bhagavata Purana narration is based on the incident which happened to King <br />
<br />
Pariksit. He was cursed by a young brahmana to die within seven days as a <br />
<br />
result of a snakebite. The boy thought the king had offended his father, who <br />
<br />
did not welcome the king in his ashrama being absorbed in deep meditation. <br />
<br />
Thus the king left after putting a dead snake on sage's shoulder. The king <br />
<br />
decided to accept the curse as a will of providence and sat down at the bank <br />
<br />
of Ganges to prepare for his death. At that time the great young sage Shuka, <br />
<br />
the son of Vyasa, arrived there and the king asked him to explain the most <br />
<br />
important knowledge meant for a person about to die. Thus the sage started to <br />
<br />
narrate the great Purana. As a result the king attained self-realization.<br />
<br />
His son Janamejaya, however, became angry at the serpents and to revenge his <br />
<br />
father's death he started a great sacrifice meant to destroy all the serpents <br />
<br />
but later he stopped it to please the sage Astika, their relative. (Astika's <br />
<br />
father was the sage Jaratkaru who married Manasa, the sister of the Naga king <br />
<br />
Vasuki.) The whole story is narrated in the Mahabharata, Adi Parva.<br />
<br />
The origin of the Naga race is described in the Mahabharata, Adi Parva:<br />
<br />
&quot;Long ago, in the godly millennium, Prajapati Daksha had two brilliant and <br />
<br />
sinless daughters, amazing sisters who were gifted with great beauty. Named <br />
<br />
Kadru and Vinata, they both became wives of the primordial sage Kashyapa, a <br />
<br />
husband who was equal in glory to the Prajapati. Being pleased with his <br />
<br />
religious wive, Kashyapa, with much happiness, offered them both a boon. <br />
<br />
Hearing of Kashyapa's joyful intention to let them choose an extraordinary <br />
<br />
boon, the two excellent women felt an incomparable joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kadru chose to create one thousand serpent sons, all of equal strength, and <br />
<br />
Vinata hankered to have two sons who would exceed all of Kadru's sons in <br />
<br />
stamina, strength, valor, and spiritual influence. Her husband awarded her <br />
<br />
only one and a half of these desired sons, knowing that she could not have <br />
<br />
more. Vinata then said to Kashyapa, &quot;Let me have at least one superior son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vinata felt that her purpose was satisfied and that somehow both sons would <br />
<br />
be of superior strength. Kadru too felt her purpose fulfilled, since she would <br />
<br />
have one thousand sons of equal prowess. Both wives were delighted with their <br />
<br />
boons. Then Kashyapa, that mighty ascetic, urging them to carry their embryos <br />
<br />
with utmost care, retired to the forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;After a long time Kadru produced one thousand eggs, O leader of brahmanas, <br />
<br />
and Vinata produced two eggs. Their delighted assistants placed the two <br />
<br />
sisters' eggs in moist vessels, where they remained for five hundred years. <br />
<br />
When the years had passed, the sons of Kadru hatched from their eggs, but from <br />
<br />
Vinata's two eggs her two sons were not to be seen. That austere and godly <br />
<br />
woman, anxious to have children, was ashamed. Thus Vinata broke open one egg <br />
<br />
and saw therein her son. Authorities say that the upper half of the child's <br />
<br />
body was fully developed, but the lower half was not yet well formed.&quot;<br />
<br />
This son was Aruna, the charioteer of Surya, the sun god. His brother was the <br />
<br />
powerful Garuda, divine eagle, who became the carrier of Vishnu. Garuda is an <br />
<br />
avowed enemy of serpents who are his food. Krishna mentions him among the most <br />
<br />
prominent representatives of His power: &quot;Among the Daitya demons I am the <br />
<br />
devoted Prahlada, among subduers I am time, among beasts I am the lion, and <br />
<br />
among birds I am Garuda.&quot; (Bhagavad-gita 10.30)<br />
<br />
Nilamata Purana, the ancient history of Kashmir, is centered around the <br />
<br />
original inhabitants of Kashmir, the Nagas. In the verses 232-233 it mentions <br />
<br />
their capital: &quot;O Naga, the dwelling of the Nagas is the city named Bhogavati. <br />
<br />
Having become a Yogi that Naga-chief (Vasuki) dwells there as well as here. <br />
<br />
But with his primary body, Vasuki, protecting the Nagas, shall live in <br />
<br />
Bhogavati. O sinless one, you (also) dwell here constantly.&quot; Bhogavati is also <br />
<br />
mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana 1.11.11. Its another name is Putkari.<br />
<br />
Bhagavata Purana gives the following description of Bila-svarga, the <br />
<br />
subterranean regions compared for their opulence to heaven (5.24.7-15):<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear King, beneath this earth are seven other planets, known as Atala, <br />
<br />
Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala and Patala. I have already <br />
<br />
explained the situation of the planetary systems of earth. The width and <br />
<br />
length of the seven lower planetary systems are calculated to be exactly the <br />
<br />
same as those of earth.<br />
<br />
&quot;In these seven planetary systems, which are also known as the subterranean <br />
<br />
heavens &lt;bila-svarga&gt;, there are very beautiful houses, gardens and places of <br />
<br />
sense enjoyment, which are even more opulent than those in the higher planets <br />
<br />
because the demons have a very high standard of sensual pleasure, wealth and <br />
<br />
influence. Most of the residents of these planets, who are known as Daityas, <br />
<br />
Danavas and Nagas, live as householders. Their wives, children, friends and <br />
<br />
society are all fully engaged in illusory, material happiness. The sense <br />
<br />
enjoyment of the demigods is sometimes disturbed, but the residents of these <br />
<br />
planets enjoy life without disturbances. Thus they are understood to be very <br />
<br />
attached to illusory happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear King, in the imitation heavens known as bila-svarga there is a great <br />
<br />
demon named Maya Danava, who is an expert artist and architect. He has <br />
<br />
constructed many brilliantly decorated cities. There are many wonderful <br />
<br />
houses, walls, gates, assembly houses, temples, yards and temple compounds, as <br />
<br />
well as many hotels serving as residential quarters for foreigners. The houses <br />
<br />
for the leaders of these planets are constructed with the most valuable <br />
<br />
jewels, and they are always crowded with living entities known as Nagas and <br />
<br />
Asuras, as well as many pigeons, parrots and similar birds. All in all, these <br />
<br />
imitation heavenly cities are most beautifully situated and attractively <br />
<br />
decorated.<br />
<br />
&quot;The parks and gardens in the artificial heavens surpass in beauty those of <br />
<br />
the upper heavenly planets. The trees in those gardens, embraced by creepers, <br />
<br />
bend with a heavy burden of twigs with fruits and flowers, and therefore they <br />
<br />
appear extraordinarily beautiful. That beauty could attract anyone and make <br />
<br />
his mind fully blossom in the pleasure of sense gratification. There are many <br />
<br />
lakes and reservoirs with clear, transparent water, agitated by jumping fish <br />
<br />
and decorated with many flowers such as lilies, kuvalayas, kahlaras and blue <br />
<br />
and red lotuses. Pairs of cakravakas and many other water birds nest in the <br />
<br />
lakes and always enjoy in a happy mood, making sweet, pleasing vibrations that <br />
<br />
are very satisfying and conducive to enjoyment of the senses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since there is no sunshine in those subterranean planets, time is not divided <br />
<br />
into days and nights, and consequently fear produced by time does not exist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many great serpents reside there with gems on their hoods, and the effulgence <br />
<br />
of these gems dissipates the darkness in all directions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since the residents of these planets drink and bathe in juices and elixirs <br />
<br />
made from wonderful herbs, they are freed from all anxieties and physical <br />
<br />
diseases. They have no experience of grey hair, wrinkles or invalidity, their <br />
<br />
bodily lusters do not fade, their perspiration does not cause a bad smell, and <br />
<br />
they are not troubled by fatigue or by lack of energy or enthusiasm due to old <br />
<br />
age.<br />
<br />
&quot;They live very auspiciously and do not fear death from anything but death's <br />
<br />
established time, which is the effulgence of the Sudarshana chakra of the <br />
<br />
Supreme Personality of Godhead.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the Sudarshana disc enters those provinces, the pregnant wives of the <br />
<br />
demons all have miscarriages due to fear of its effulgence.&quot;<br />
<br />
5.24.29-31:<br />
<br />
&quot;The planetary system below Talatala is known as Mahatala. It is the abode of <br />
<br />
many-hooded snakes, descendants of Kadru, who are always very angry. The great <br />
<br />
snakes who are prominent are Kuhaka, Taksaka, Kaliya and Susena. The snakes in <br />
<br />
Mahatala are always disturbed by fear of Garuda, the carrier of Lord Vishnu, <br />
<br />
but although they are full of anxiety, some of them nevertheless sport with <br />
<br />
their wives, children, friends and relatives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beneath Mahatala is the planetary system known as Rasatala, which is the <br />
<br />
abode of the demoniac sons of Diti and Danu. They are called Panis, <br />
<br />
Nivata-kavacas, Kaleyas and Hiranya-puravasis &lt;those living in Hiranya-pura&gt;. <br />
<br />
They are all enemies of the demigods, and they reside in holes like snakes. <br />
<br />
From birth they are extremely powerful and cruel, and although they are proud <br />
<br />
of their strength, they are always defeated by the Sudarshana chakra of the <br />
<br />
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who rules all the planetary systems. When a <br />
<br />
female messenger from Indra named Sarama chants a particular curse, the <br />
<br />
serpentine demons of Mahatala become very afraid of Indra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beneath Rasatala is another planetary system, known as Patala or Nagaloka, <br />
<br />
where there are many demoniac serpents, the masters of Nagaloka, such as <br />
<br />
Shankha, Kulika, Mahashankha, Shveta, Dhananjaya, Dhrtarashtra, Shankhacuda, <br />
<br />
Kambala, Ashvatara and Devadatta. The chief among them is Vasuki. They are all <br />
<br />
extremely angry, and they have many, many hoods - some snakes five hoods, some <br />
<br />
seven, some ten, others a hundred and others a thousand. These hoods are <br />
<br />
bedecked with valuable gems, and the light emanating from the gems illuminates <br />
<br />
the entire planetary system of bila-svarga.&quot;<br />
<br />
Divine connection<br />
<br />
Serpents have their special place in most spiritual traditions (as already <br />
<br />
shown above) where they symbolize either good or evil. In the Vedic tradition <br />
<br />
they are inherently related to some of its most important personages.<br />
<br />
Shiva<br />
<br />
Shiva (&quot;auspicious One&quot;), is one of the members of the trimurti (Brahma, <br />
<br />
Vishnu and Shiva). He is in charge of the material mode of ignorance <br />
<br />
(tamo-guna) bringing destruction of the universe:<br />
<br />
&quot;Yamaraja said: My dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but <br />
<br />
factually I am not. Above me, and above all the other demigods, including <br />
<br />
Indra and Candra, is the one supreme master and controller. The partial <br />
<br />
manifestations of His personality are Brahma, Visnu and Siva, who are in <br />
<br />
charge of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this universe. He is <br />
<br />
like the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth. The <br />
<br />
entire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a rope in <br />
<br />
its nose.&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 6.3.12)<br />
<br />
His position is between the living beings (jiva-tattva) and the Supreme Lord, <br />
<br />
Vishnu (vishnu-tattva), in the category of his own, shiva-tattva.<br />
<br />
Shiva is usually depicted in painting and sculpture as white or ash-colored, <br />
<br />
with a blue neck (from holding in his throat the poison thrown up at the <br />
<br />
churning of the cosmic ocean, which threatened to destroy humankind), his hair <br />
<br />
arranged in a coil of matted locks (jatamakuta) and adorned with the crescent <br />
<br />
moon and the Ganges (he allowed her to trickle through his hair). He has three <br />
<br />
eyes, the third eye bestowing inward vision but capable of burning destruction <br />
<br />
when focused outward. He wears a garland of skulls and a serpent around his <br />
<br />
neck and carries in his two (sometimes four) hands a deerskin, a trident, a <br />
<br />
small hand drum, or a club with a skull at the end.<br />
<br />
His paraphernalia symbolizes: moon - time measurement in months, three eyes - <br />
<br />
tri-kala-jna (&quot;knower of three phases of time - past, present, and future&quot;), <br />
<br />
snake around the neck - time measurement in years, necklace of skulls with <br />
<br />
snakes - changing of ages and begetting and annihilating of mankind. His <br />
<br />
association with the serpents is obvious from his epithets: Nagabhushana, <br />
<br />
Vyalakalpa (&quot;having serpents as ornaments&quot;), Nagaharadhrik (&quot;wearing <br />
<br />
serpent-necklaces&quot;), Nagaraja, Nagendra, Nagesha (&quot;king of Nagas&quot;), Nakula <br />
<br />
(&quot;mongoose,&quot; one who is immune from the serpent venom), Vyalin (&quot;one who <br />
<br />
possesses snakes&quot;), etc. Shiva is the main object of worship at Benares under <br />
<br />
the name Vishveshvara (&quot;master of the universe&quot;).<br />
<br />
One of his features is time (Bhagavad-gita 11.32: &quot;Time I am,&quot; Bhagavata <br />
<br />
Purana 3.5.26-27, Brahma-samhita 5.10), the separating factor between the <br />
<br />
material and spiritual world (Bhagavata Purana 3.10.12) and a medium to <br />
<br />
perceive the Lord's influence (Bhagavata Purana 3.26.16).<br />
<br />
Shiva's female consort is known under various names as Uma, Sati, Parvati, <br />
<br />
Durga, Kali, and Shakti. The divine couple, together with their sons - the <br />
<br />
six-headed Skanda and the elephant-headed Ganesha - are inhabiting the Mount <br />
<br />
Kailasa in the Himalayas as well as the Mahesha-dhama on the border of the <br />
<br />
material world (Devi-dhama) and the spiritual world (Vaikuntha or Hari-dhama).<br />
<br />
In the Brahma-samhita he is said to be another form of Maha-Vishnu, and is <br />
<br />
compared to a yogurt. Yogurt is nothing but milk, yet it is not milk. As <br />
<br />
yogurt is prepared when milk is mixed with a culture, the form of Shiva <br />
<br />
expands when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in touch with material <br />
<br />
nature. Since Shiva and Vishnu are aspects of one God, Shiva occurs as one of <br />
<br />
Vishnu's names listed in the Vishnu-sahasranama.<br />
<br />
The original father, Krishna, says, aham bija-pradah pita: &quot;I am the <br />
<br />
seed-giving father.&quot; That pita (father) is Lord Shiva, Shambhu, and material <br />
<br />
nature (goddess Durga) is considered the mother. By their sexual union are all <br />
<br />
conditioned souls inserted into the material nature. The impregnation of <br />
<br />
material nature is wonderful because at one time innumerable living beings are <br />
<br />
conceived. Bhago jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate (Shvetashvatara <br />
<br />
Upanishad 5.9). In this way Shiva is connected with both creation and <br />
<br />
destruction. Because of his marginal position between material and spiritual <br />
<br />
realm he is seemingly full of contradictions but these are reconciled on the <br />
<br />
transcendental level.<br />
<br />
Ananta Shesha<br />
<br />
Some of the Nagas are many-headed. Ananta, also called Shesha, the king of the <br />
<br />
Nagas, has unlimited heads. According to the Bhagavata Purana 5.25.3, He is <br />
<br />
the source of Rudra, an expansion of Shiva. When Krishna lists the most <br />
<br />
prominent representatives of His power, He says, ananta casmi naganam - &quot;among <br />
<br />
the Nagas I am Ananta&quot; (Bhagavad-gita 10.29).<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear Lord, at the end of each millennium &lt;here Brahma's life&gt; the Supreme <br />
<br />
Personality of Godhead Garbhodakashayi Vishnu dissolves everything manifested <br />
<br />
within the universe into His belly. He lies down on the lap of Shesha Naga, <br />
<br />
from His navel sprouts a golden lotus flower on a stem, and on that lotus Lord <br />
<br />
Brahma is created. I can understand that You are the same Supreme Godhead. I <br />
<br />
therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 4.9.14)<br />
<br />
Ananta is called Shesha as He is the residue or remainder of the universe <br />
<br />
during cosmic dissolutions. He is elaborately described in the Bhagavata <br />
<br />
Purana, 5th khanda, chapter 25. Ultimately He will destroy the world: &quot;At the <br />
<br />
time of the final devastation of the complete universe &lt;the end of the <br />
<br />
duration of Brahma's life&gt;, a flame of fire emanates from the mouth of Ananta <br />
<br />
(...). (Bhagavata Purana 2.2.26)<br />
<br />
Sage Patanjali, the author of Yoga-sutras, is considered by some to be an <br />
<br />
incarnation of Shesha. He is the author of the Mahabhashya, the celebrated <br />
<br />
commentary on the Grammar of Panini, and a defense of that work against the <br />
<br />
criticisms of philosopher Katyayana. His name allegedly represents that he <br />
<br />
fell as a small snake from heaven into the palm of Panini (pata - fallen, <br />
<br />
anjali - palm).<br />
<br />
South Indian Vaishnava philosopher and spiritual leader Ramanuja (11th <br />
<br />
century) is also considered an incarnation of Shesha.<br />
<br />
Balarama<br />
<br />
&quot;The foremost manifestation of Krishna is Sankarshana, who is known as Ananta. <br />
<br />
He is the origin of all incarnations within this material world. Previous to <br />
<br />
the appearance of Lord Krishna, this original Sankarshana will appear as <br />
<br />
Baladeva, just to please the Supreme Lord Krishna in His transcendental <br />
<br />
pastimes.&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 10.1.24)<br />
<br />
&quot;According to expert opinion, Balarama, as the chief of the original quadruple <br />
<br />
forms, is also the original Sankarshana. Balarama, the first expansion of <br />
<br />
Krishna, expands Himself in five forms: (1) Maha-Sankarshana, (2) <br />
<br />
Karanabdhishayi, (3) Garbhodakashayi, (4) Kshirodakashayi, and (5) Shesha. <br />
<br />
These five plenary portions are responsible for both the spiritual and <br />
<br />
material cosmic manifestations. In these five forms Lord Balarama assists Lord <br />
<br />
Krishna in His activities. The first four of these forms are responsible for <br />
<br />
the cosmic manifestations, whereas Shesha is responsible for personal service <br />
<br />
to the Lord. Shesha is called Ananta, or unlimited, because He assists the <br />
<br />
Personality of Godhead in His unlimited expansions by performing an unlimited <br />
<br />
variety of services. Shri Balarama is the servitor Godhead who serves Lord <br />
<br />
Krishna in all affairs of existence and knowledge. Lord Nityananda Prabhu, who <br />
<br />
is the same servitor Godhead, Balarama, performs the same service to Lord <br />
<br />
Gauranga by constant association.&quot; (Chaitanya Charitamrta, Adi-lila 5.10, <br />
<br />
purport by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada)<br />
<br />
Balarama appeared as Krishna's older brother and took part in Krishna's <br />
<br />
childhood pastimes in Vrindavana. He is the first direct expansion of Krishna. <br />
<br />
Balarama only had one wife, Revati, daughter of King Raivata, and by her He <br />
<br />
had two sons, Nishatha and Ulmuka. He is represented as having fair <br />
<br />
complexion, and clad in a dark-blue vest (nilavastra). His special weapons are <br />
<br />
the club (khetaka or saunanda), the plow (hala), and the pestle (musala). Thus <br />
<br />
He is called Phala, Hala, Halayudha (&quot;plow-armed&quot;), Halabhrit, Langali <br />
<br />
(&quot;plow-bearer&quot;), Sankarshana (&quot;one who attracts everything&quot;), Musali <br />
<br />
(&quot;pestle-holder&quot;). As he has a palm for a banner, he is called Taladhvaja. He <br />
<br />
represents guru-tattva, the principle of spiritual master.<br />
<br />
&quot;May the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Dhanvantari <br />
<br />
relieve me from undesirable eatables and protect me from physical illness. May <br />
<br />
Lord Rsabhadeva, who conquered His inner and outer senses, protect me from <br />
<br />
fear produced by the duality of heat and cold. May Yajna protect me from <br />
<br />
defamation and harm from the populace, and may Lord Balarama as Shesha protect <br />
<br />
me from envious serpents.&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 6.8.18)<br />
<br />
&quot;The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Freed from all sinful reactions are <br />
<br />
those who rise from bed at the end of night, early in the morning, and fully <br />
<br />
concentrate their minds with great attention upon My form; your form; this <br />
<br />
lake; this mountain; the caves; the gardens; the cane plants; the bamboo <br />
<br />
plants; the celestial trees; the residential quarters of Me, Lord Brahma and <br />
<br />
Lord Shiva; the three peaks of Trikuta Mountain, made of gold, silver and <br />
<br />
iron; My very pleasing abode &lt;the ocean of milk&gt;; the white island, <br />
<br />
Shvetadvipa, which is always brilliant with spiritual rays; My mark of <br />
<br />
Shrivatsa; the Kaustubha gem; My Vaijayanti garland; My club, Kaumodaki; My <br />
<br />
Sudarshana disc and Pancajanya conchshell; My bearer, Garuda, the king of the <br />
<br />
birds; My bed, Shesha Naga; My expansion of energy the goddess of fortune; <br />
<br />
Lord Brahma; Narada Muni; Lord Shiva; Prahlada; My incarnations like Matsya, <br />
<br />
Kurma and Varaha; My unlimited all-auspicious activities, which yield piety to <br />
<br />
he who hears them; the sun; the moon; fire; the mantra omkara; the Absolute <br />
<br />
Truth; the total material energy; the cows and brahmanas; devotional service; <br />
<br />
the wives of Soma and Kashyapa, who are all daughters of King Daksha; the <br />
<br />
Rivers Ganges, Sarasvati, Nanda and Yamuna &lt;Kalindi&gt;; the elephant Airavata; <br />
<br />
Dhruva Maharaja; the seven rshis; and the pious human beings.&quot; (Bhagavata <br />
<br />
Purana 8.4.17-24)<br />
<br />
Although Garuda enmity toward serpents is known from this verse it is clear <br />
<br />
that both Garuda and Shesha Naga are servants of the Lord Vishnu, or Krishna.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
Although this overview of the position of a Serpent in different traditions is <br />
<br />
far from exhaustive the conspicuous similarity of accounts from different <br />
<br />
cultural contexts hints that the Vedic tradition spread in the distant past <br />
<br />
over large parts of the world. This is also supported by the tradition itself.<br />
<br />
In this article we have traced the Serpent in various traditions, places and <br />
<br />
contexts which ultimately lead us to the transcendental realm. On this level <br />
<br />
the duality of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; ceases to exist as everything is of absolute <br />
<br />
nature. This puts an end to the Serpent controversy.<br />

		"articleBody": "The ancient traditions and scriptures from different continents talk about a \n\nrace of serpent beings endowed with superhuman powers. The scriptural and \n\nfolkloric resources are used to present more complete picture of them and \n\ntheir ancient and recent interaction with humans.\n\nThere has been an unprecedented increase of interest in UFO and \n\nparanormal issues in official media. Some consider this to be a result of \n\nleaks from the intelligence community. The fact is that there has been wide \n\nand profound change of public attitude in this regard. An example of this is \n\nhow the alien image underwent a significant change during the years, from the \n\nridiculed \"little green men\" of the cartoons in the early fifties to the \n\nclassical \"grays\" as benevolent \"space brothers\" in seventies. Later, however, \n\nthey have become more and more malicious and associated with the phenomena of \n\ncattle mutilation and human abduction. This picture is probably the one most \n\noften associated with the word \"aliens\" nowadays.\n\nBut in the past few years there appeared a new type of aliens: the \n\n\"reptilians\" (also called \"reptoids,\" \"sauroids\" etc.). The media and market \n\nbecame flooded by reptile\/dragon\/dinosaur characters. The entertainment \n\nindustry made them almost omnipresent, from children toys and cartoons to most \n\nsuccessful movies. This phenomena is analyzed to some extent in the file The \n\nCult of the Serpent and others. Several \"alien files\" available on the internet present a compilation of manifold information about aliens \n\nin earth's history, presence and possible future as well as many of the \n\nrelated incidents regarding space and underground explorations. They also \n\ninclude quotations from various scriptures including the Bible and the Vedas. \n\nThe term \"Veda,\" literally \"knowledge,\" the indologists usually apply \n\nto the four Vedas: Rg, Sama, Yajur and Atharva. However, in broader sense, it \n\nis also used for the related literature as the Puranas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, \n\nItihasas etc. The fact that in these files the reptilians are associated with the Nagas of \n\nthe ancient Vedic tradition is one of the reasons I have decided to write this \n\narticle. \n\nSaurian Connection: Historical Background of the Serpent\n\nThe snake (serpent spirit) has been a symbol of wisdom, eternity, healing, \n\nmystery, magical power, and holiness throughout most of the ancient \n\nnon-western world. Its symbol is used today in medicine, and other healing \n\nprofessions, and its live descendants are hailed as sacred and used in \n\neverything from cancer drugs to sex potions. Serpent was worshiped in ancient \n\nBabylon, Mexico, Egypt, as well as many other places all over the world.\n\nThe following passage is written by Soror Ourania (from \"Thelemix and Therion \n\nRising\") from the Gnostic point of view.\n\n\"The word Naga is rooted in Sanskrit and means \"serpent.\" <Further meanings \n\nfrom the Sanskrit-English Dictionary by Monier Monier-Williams: m. \"not \n\nmoving,\" a mountain (in Atharva Veda); the number 7 (because of the 7 \n\nprincipal mountains; any tree or plant (in Mahabharata); the sun.> In the East \n\nIndian pantheon it is connected with the Serpent Spirit and the Dragon Spirit. \n\nIt has an equivalence to the Burmese Nats, or god-serpents. In the Esoteric \n\nTradition it is synonymous for Adepts, or Initiates. In India and Egypt, and \n\neven in Central and South America, the Naga stands for one who is wise.\n\n\"The <buddhist philosopher> Nagarjuna of India, for example, is shown with an \n\naura, or halo, of seven serpents which is an indication of a very high degree \n\nof Initiation. The symbolism of the seven serpents, usually cobras, are also \n\non Masonic aprons or certain systems in the Buddhist ruins of Cambodia \n\n(Ankhor) and Ceylon. The great temple-builders of the famous Ankhor Wat were \n\nconsidered to be the semi-divine Khmers. The avenue leading to the Temple is \n\nlined with the seven-headed Naga. And even in Mexico, we find the \"Naga\" which \n\nbecomes \"Nagal.\" In China, the Naga is given the form of the Dragon and has a \n\ndirect association with the Emperor and is known as the \"Son of Heaven\"... \n\nwhile in Egypt the same association is termed \"King-Initiate.\" The Chinese are \n\neven said to have originated with the Serpent demi-gods and even to speak \n\ntheir language, Naga-Krita. For a place that has no serpents, Tibet, they are \n\nstill known in a symbolic sense and are called \"Lu!\" (Naga). Nagarjuna called \n\nin Tibetan, <becomes> Lu-trub.\n\n\"In the Western traditions we find the same ubiquity for the Naga, or Serpent. \n\nOne simple example is the Ancient Greek Goddess, Athena. She is known as a \n\nwarrior Goddess as well as the Goddess of Wisdom; her symbol being the Serpent \n\nas displayed on her personal shield. Of course, in Genesis the Serpent is a \n\nNaga who instructs the new infant (humanity) in what is called the Knowledge \n\nof Good and Evil. The Christian church has, unfortunately transformed the \n\nInitiate-Teacher into a tempting and negative demon-character. An apocryphal \n\ntradition says that Apollonius of Tyana, while on a visit to India, was taught \n\nby the \"Nagas\" of Kashmir. (See The Life of Apollonius, by Philostratos) It is \n\nfelt by many scholars of the Western Tradition that the life of Apollonius was \n\ntaken from the New Testament, or that the narratives of the New Testament have \n\nbeen taken from the life of Apollonius. This is felt because of the undisputed \n\nand clear similarities of construction of that particular narrative.\n\n\"Naga is one of a handful of rare words surviving the loss of the first \n\nuniversal language. In Buddhism, Wisdom has always been tied, symbolically, to \n\nthe figure of the Serpent. In the Western Tradition it can be found as used by \n\nthe Christ in the Gospel of Saint Matthew (10:16), \"Be ye therefore wise as \n\nserpents, and harmless as doves.\"\n\n\"In all mythological language the snake is also an emblem of immortality. Its \n\nendless representation with its tail in its mouth (Ouroboros), and the \n\nconstant renewal of its skin and vigor, enliven the symbols of continued youth \n\nand eternity.\n\n\"The Serpent's reputation for positive medicinal and\/or life-preserving \n\nqualities have also contributed to the honors of the Serpent as STILL seen by \n\nthe employment of the caduceus <staff around which two snakes are wrapped>. To \n\nthis very day, the Hindus are taught that at the end of every Universal \n\nManifestation (Kalpa) all things are re-absorbed into Deity during the \n\ninterval between \"creations.\" He reposes upon the Serpent Shesha (Duration) \n\nwho is called Ananta, or Endless.\"\n\nIndoeuropean (Slavic) folklore\n\nThe Slavic folklore often mentions snakes as the guards of treasures hidden \n\nunderground or in caves closely following the Vedic tradition. Some of the \n\nsnakes are said to possess a crown which is an interesting detail as we will \n\nsee later.\n\nAlthough one may be tempted to discount the folklore as unreliable source \n\nthere is certain evidence which seems to support it.\n\nCzech herpetologist Jiri Hales writes in his book \"Moji pratele hadi (\"My \n\nfriends, the snakes\") about his travels around eastern Slovakia in '70 in \n\nsearch of unusually great snakes and mentions several interesting accounts he \n\nheard from the local people. One even involves a military unit which was \n\ncalled to destroy an alleged 15 ft long snake. (Snakes of such length are \n\nunknown in this part of the world.) Another account pertains to a ranger who \n\nnoticed a number of snakes in the forest crawling in one direction and out of \n\ncuriosity followed them. Thus he has come upon a great \"snake king\" with a \n\ncrown on his head surrounded by many snakes. Scared, he quickly left that \n\nplace. Other accounts involve small children who claimed to play with great \n\nsnakes and even communicate with them. Hales concludes that these accounts are \n\ncredible as they include many details which a layman could not possibly make \n\nup without personal experience.\n\nNorth America: Hopi tribal tradition\n\nThe Hopi legend is that there were two races, the children of the feather who \n\ncame from the skies, and the children of the reptile who came from under the \n\nearth. The children of the reptile chased the Hopi Indians out of the earth. \n\nThese evil under-grounders were also called Two Hearts.\n\nThe Hopi Indian Legend of Creation tells of three different beginnings. One \n\nstory says that Hopi have arisen from an underground paradise through an \n\nopening called Sipapu. The underground paradise was wondrous with beautiful \n\nclear skies and plentiful food sources <cf bila-svarga>. It was because of the \n\nexistence of those called Two Hearts, the bad ones, that refuge was sought in \n\nthe upper world by the Hopi, the peaceful ones. The underworld was not \n\ndestroyed but was only sealed up to prevent the Two Hearts from rising upon to \n\nthe surface world.\n\nThe second story tells of the descent of the Hopi from the Blue Star of a \n\nconstellation called the Seven Sisters. One version tells of their travel to \n\nearth on the back of Enki, the eagle. Grandfather, the Great Spirit, allowed \n\nthe first man to select his home from the many stars of the universe. Enki \n\ntold first man of his home earth, and brought him to visit. First man's \n\nexploration of the earth convinced him that this was where he wanted his \n\nchildren to be born and to grow. First Man returned to the heavens to tell \n\nGrandfather of his decision. Grandfather was pleased and granted to first man \n\nthe right to call earth his home. First man soon returned to the green place \n\nor Sakwap with his family shortly afterwards. (Many of the hero stories \n\nthroughout time and through many different cultures refer to a valiant group \n\nof seven.)\n\nThese two legends remind of the story of Kashyapa Muni and his two wives, \n\nKadru, the mother of serpents, and Vinata, the mother of Garuda, the divine \n\neagle, mentioned later.\n\nWestern Africa\n\nThe Legend of Da\n\nThe world was created by Nana-Buluku, the one god, who is neither male nor \n\nfemale. In time, Nana-Buluku gave birth to twins, Mawu and Lisa, and it is \n\nthey who shaped the world and control it still, with their fourteen children, \n\nthe Vodou, or lesser gods.\n\nIn the beginning, before Mawu had any children, the Rainbow Serpent, Da, \n\nalready existed - created to serve Nana-Buluku. The creator was carried \n\neverywhere in Da's mouth. Rivers, mountains, and valleys twine and curve \n\nbecause that is how the Rainbow Serpent Da moves. Wherever they stopped for \n\nthe night, mountains arose, formed from the serpent's dung. That is why if you \n\ndig down deep into a mountain, you find riches.\n\nNow, when Nana-Buluku had finished creating, it was obvious that the earth \n\njust couldn't carry everything - all the mountains, trees, peoples, and \n\nanimals. So, to keep the earth from capsizing, the creator asked Da to coil \n\nbeneath it to cushion it - like the pads the African women and girls wear on \n\ntheir heads when they are carrying a heavy load.\n\nBecause Da cannot stand heat, the creator made the ocean for the serpent to \n\nlive in. And there Da has remained since the beginning of time, with his tail \n\nin his mouth. Even though the water keeps Da cool, he sometimes shifts around \n\ntrying to get comfortable, and that's what causes earthquakes.\n\nNana-Buluku tasked the red monkeys who live beneath the sea to keep Da fed, \n\nand they spend their time forging the iron bars that are the serpent's food. \n\nBut sooner or later the monkey's supply of iron is bound to run out, and then \n\nDa will have nothing to eat. Famished with hunger, he will start to chew on \n\nhis own tail, and then his writhings and convulsions will be so terrible that \n\nthe whole earth will tilt, overburdened as it is with people and things, and \n\nslip into the sea.\n\nThis legend mentions the serpent serving the creator god. This serpent \n\nresembles Ananta Shesha, who serves Vishnu as a bed and supports the universal \n\nstructure. They are both situated at the bottom of the universe on the great \n\nocean called Garbhodaka.\n\nScandinavia\n\nThe Norse Ragnarok involves the destruction of the earth and the abodes of the \n\nNorse demigods (called Asgard). It is said that during Ragnarok the world is \n\ndestroyed with flames by a being called Surt, who lives beneath the lower \n\nworld (appropriately called Hel) and was involved in the world's creation. By \n\ncomparison, the Bhagavata Purana (3.11.30) states that at the end of Brahma's \n\nday, \"the devastation takes place due to the fire emanating from the mouth of \n\nSankarshana.\" Sankarshana (Ananta Shesha) is a plenary expansion of Krishna \n\nwho is \"seated at the bottom of the universe\" (Bhagavata Purana 3.8.3), \n\nbeneath the lower planetary systems.\n\nIn the Norse lore there can be found more connections to the Vedic tradition \n\nbut they go beyond the present topic.\n\nTibet\n\nTibetan Buddhist perspective of the Nagas comes from Cho-Yang's \"Year of Tibet \n\nEdition\":\n\n\"Among all the creatures of the six realms, humans are the most fortunate, and \n\nhave the best opportunity for attaining the ultimate achievement. Gods and \n\ndemi-gods dwell in immeasurable happiness, exhausting the fruits of their \n\npositive karma, and are too distracted with worldly pleasure to seek \n\nliberation from cyclic existence. Hungry ghosts and hell beings are too \n\ndisturbed with suffering and animals are too dumb. Humans, who enjoy both \n\npleasure and pain are the only ones who can seek liberation. (...)\n\n\"Unseen forces are believed to be as numerous as those we can see: in every \n\npond, forest, tree, house, dwell creatures big and small, important and humble \n\nwhich occasionally appear to humans in various forms, as well as in visions \n\nand in dreams.\n\n\"All these creatures are believed to be ruled by the protectors of the ten \n\ndirections. These deities include gods from the Hindu pantheon such as Brahma \n\nand Indra. They are gods, and though they are immensely powerful and believed \n\nto control all the forces of the universe they are not beyond the wheel of \n\ncyclic existence and thus cannot be an object of refuge for humans aspiring \n\nfor liberation. They may or may not be sympathetic to the Buddhist doctrine, \n\nbut their help and cooperation can be cultivated and is considered essential, \n\nsince they control all other non-human creatures, gods, demi-gods and ghosts. \n\nTantric rituals always include an offering to them at the beginning to assure \n\ntheir non-interference.\n\n\"The creatures dwelling in individual places are called Sa-dag or land owners, \n\nor guardian deities. They belong to the realm of demi-gods or ghosts - not all \n\nghosts are miserable creatures, some are wealthy and powerful demons. They may \n\nappear to people as ghosts, demons, or in dreams in an infinite variety of \n\nforms, including the human one and may either help or harm depending on their \n\ndisposition. Many of the creatures in lakes, ponds and rivers are nagas, or \n\nserpent beings who belong to the animal realm. They sometimes appear in the \n\nform of snakes, or as half snakes and half humans with elaborate jeweled \n\ncrowns. They are believed to be infinitely wealthy and to owe their present \n\nform to a previous life of unethical generosity. <Comment: This is called \n\nbhogonmukhi-sukrti, or pious activities that bestow material opulence. They \n\nare of godless nature but involve kindness to other beings, with a view toward \n\nmaterial happiness.>\n\n\"Human activity is bound to encroach on the well-being of living creatures \n\nincluding those of other realms. Coming to a plot of land and inadvertently \n\nbuilding a house, cutting trees or mining and digging natural resources will \n\nupset nagas and sa-dags just as it does animals and insects in such a \n\nsituation. It is said that sa-dags and nagas equate the unauthorized use of \n\nland and natural resources they occupy to pilfering their personal \n\npossessions. The weaker ones among them will undergo great hardship or die \n\noff, while the more powerful will react with anger and strike back at the \n\noffenders, inflicting disease, death, and sudden catastrophe. They will not \n\nnecessarily strike at the humans having committed the harm, as most cannot \n\nidentify the actual offenders, but at any human they see, and innocent people \n\nmay fall ill or die for no apparent reason, or the whole area be affected with \n\nepidemics or cases of leprosy.\n\n\"The following story was related by a Dema Locho Rinpochey, from Drepung, and \n\noccurred in the 1950s in Tibet. One day, one of the monks who was responsible \n\nfor having the trees in the debating square watered, developed a large sore on \n\nhis thigh. Suspecting it was caused by harm from nagas, he asked Rinpochey to \n\nconsult an oracle in a nearby village - a nun who was possessed by nagas - to \n\nfind out the cause of his illness. The naga, speaking through the oracle \n\nadmitted having caused the harm: 'Yes, it was I who struck at that monk.' When \n\nRinpochey asked the reason, it replied: 'I was angry at humans for other \n\nreasons and I saw this monk's luck was down and that he was vulnerable, so I \n\ncaused him to develop this sore'.\n\n\"Humans are most vulnerable to nagas and sa-dags when their luck is low, as it \n\nis said that any weakness is immediately apparent to these other-worldly \n\ncreatures. In order to avert unlucky circumstances which may bring one harm, \n\npeople hang up strings of different prayer flags bearing the image of a horse. \n\nThe 'wind-horse' or Lung-ta is the symbol of one's luck. The Tibetan \n\nexpression 'His wind-horse is running' or 'is broken' refers to this luck, and \n\nthe prayer flags fluttering in the wind, a tradition of Bon origin, is \n\nbelieved to give the upper hand to one's wind-horse.\n\n\"Since humans cannot survive without some form of land exploitation and \n\nbuilding, Tibetans take certain measures to prevent unnecessary mishaps. While \n\nthe hanging of prayer flags is like a general preventive measure, that of \n\navoiding harm which has no direct cause, more particular measures are sought \n\nwhen any kind of digging is involved. Whenever choosing a site for building, \n\nwhether for a mandala, temple or house, a lama is consulted as to the method \n\nby which the nagas and sa-dag on the site might be appeased and treated. The \n\nlama will know something about them either through dreams, divination or \n\nclairvoyance. According to Buddhist tantric practice, there are other ways of \n\nperforming rituals. These are: peaceful, increasing, forceful and wrathful. \n\nThe methods that apply to pacifying creatures of other realms are peaceful and \n\nwrathful, and the rituals used are extremely varied, in type as well as in \n\ntradition.\n\n\"Generally, in either case, a ritual based on sutra called Tashi Sojong is \n\nperformed, to bring good luck and please the dwellers. If performing tantric \n\nrituals, the lama will offer tormas to the sa-dag or nagas abiding on the \n\nland. Tormas are conical-shaped offering cakes which have been blessed in \n\nthree ways by a highly realized being by mantras, where they are purified from \n\nany defilements of ordinariness, by meditational stabilization, by which they \n\nare made infinite and by gestures, or mudras, which ensure that the recipient \n\nis satisfied. The idea of this ritual is to offer gifts to the sa-dag and \n\nnagas in exchange for use of their land. It is a deal, a give and take \n\nsituation like selling a house, and if the 'sellers' are satisfied, things \n\nwill proceed smoothly. There are some situations, however, where the land may \n\nbe owned by particularly powerful sa-dags, who will not want to give in to \n\nhumans and will do their utmost to create obstacles and harm. Such places are \n\nknown as 'rough'. The spirits and demons inhabiting them will be unyielding in \n\ntheir views and generally delight in causing harm to human trespassers causing \n\nillness and bad dreams. If the lama examining the land sees such a situation, \n\nhe will either declare the site unfit for building, or deal with the situation \n\nusing the wrathful method.\n\n\"Through the possibilities are vast, the most commonly used wrathful method \n\nfor clearing a site from negative forces, is the 'throwing of ritual cakes' \n\nwhich is like using a bomb to send harmful creatures to another existence. The \n\nmotivation of the lama is one of compassion, and knowing that the purpose of \n\nthe project is beneficial one and that the being causing the harm is \n\naccumulating negative karma, he will actually help it by transferring its \n\nconsciousness to another realm where it will be of less harm to other beings. \n\nOnly a person with a higher level of realization is qualified to perform such \n\na ritual.\n\n\"When obstacles are removed, the Lu Thaye, a very powerful naga believed to be \n\nconstantly moving under the ground is dealt with. Sudden digging would disturb \n\nhim, but his movements in a particular spot can be plotted astrologically, and \n\na spot on the plot can be found where no part of his body would be present at \n\nthe time of the first, symbolic digging. This would be followed by offerings \n\nof ritual cakes to pacify him. This done, the building could proceed without \n\nfurther interference.\n\n\"In some cases, sa-dags and nagas not only take offense at encroachment on \n\ntheir land, but at harm inflicted on certain animals they feel are their own. \n\nThe following is a story which took place about eighty years ago in a remote \n\narea of Kham. The head of a group of nomads, feeling he was above the law \n\nagainst hunting wild animals which prevailed in his land, one day decided to \n\ngo shooting. He went off with his rifle and spotted a beautiful stag. He aimed \n\nat it, and saw something like a golden stirrup between its antlers. He put \n\ndown his rifle and stared, but could see nothing. He aimed and put down his \n\nrifle two or three times, seeing the stirrup appear and disappear, hesitated, \n\nand finally shot. The stag was hit by the bullet but escaped, leaving a trail \n\nof blood. That night, the man returned home, unable to find the carcass of the \n\nanimal he had hoped to kill and suddenly became very ill. As he lay dying, he \n\nrelated to his kin the incident with the stag, regretting he had shot it and \n\nmumbling he should have known better, seeing such an unusual object as a \n\ngolden stirrup between its antlers. He died that very night and his family \n\nconcluded he was the victim of a revengeful sa-dag to whom either the stag \n\nbelonged to or of which he had taken the form.\n\n\"Incense and vase-offering rituals, which were routinely performed by the \n\nTibetan government and also by private individuals and lamas were not only \n\nmeant as a remedy in case of drought or other calamities, but also as a \n\nregular preventive measure to bring about positive conditions. Non-human \n\ncreatures were known for their liking of fragrant smells, and the tradition of \n\nsang-so, which was originally practised by the Bon to appease and please local \n\ndeities, was later practised by Buddhists for the same purpose. In the case of \n\nvase-offering rituals, vases were filled with different precious metals and \n\ncereals, blessed by mantras, meditative stabilization and gestures and placed \n\nin lakes or other places throughout the country where nagas were known to \n\ndwell, as a boon to them. These gifts could be likened to presents offered by \n\nthe king of one country to that of another, aimed at pleasing the recipients \n\nwho reciprocated with timely rain, pure water and a disease free environment. \n\nThey had ways of showing their liking in particular ways. Dema Locho Rinpochey \n\nrecalls a time when Drepung Loseling college decided to renovate a small \n\nretreat house on one of their estates, a few hours from Lhasa. The place had a \n\nspring and was known for its important naga and sa-dag population. The college \n\ncalled on Rinpochey to perform a ritual to keep the nagas out of the way \n\nduring the time of the restoration work. This involved attracting them into a \n\nmirror which was transformed, by the lama's concentration, into a very \n\npleasant abode in which they were asked to remain, as honoured guests, until \n\ntheir usual dwelling was once more fit to stay in. Rinpoche also offered a \n\nbathing ritual to the spring, purifying any defilements it would have \n\nundergone during the work. He said that the next morning, the caretaker \n\npointed out that the water was much more abundant than usual, a sign that the \n\nnagas who dwelled in it were pleased.\"\n\nMiddle East\n\n\"The possibility that an ancient reptilian-saurian race may exist below the \n\nsurface of this planet is not an idea which is relatively new. This infernal \n\nyet physical race has been referred to in spiritual and historical records \n\nwhich date back to the beginning of time. Ancient Hebrew history, for \n\ninstance, records that our human ancestors were not the only intelligent, \n\nfree-will beings who inhabited the ancient world. Genesis chapter 3 refers to \n\nthe \"Serpent,\" which according to many ancient Hebrew scholars was identified \n\nwith a hominoid or bi-ped reptilian being. The ancient Hebrew word for \n\n\"Serpent\" is \"Nachash\" (which according to Strong's Comprehensive and other \n\nBiblical concordances contained in itself the meanings: Reptile, Enchantment, \n\nHissing, Whisper, Diligently Observe, Learn by Experience, Incantation, Snake, \n\netc. all of which may be descriptive of the serpent-sauroid race which we have \n\nbeen referring to). The original \"Nachash\" was not actually a \"snake\" as most \n\npeople believe, but actually an extremely intelligent, cunning creature \n\npossessed with the ability to speak and reason. It also stood upright as we've \n\nsaid, as did many of it's descendants, the small \"saurian\" predators which \n\nambled about on two legs.\" (from \"The Cult of the Serpent\" file, edited by \n\nBranton)\n\nIn the book of Genesis Elohim punished the Serpent for deceiving Eve by \n\nordering him to crawl on his stomach from that time on. They (Elohim) also \n\ncreated enmity between human and serpent race.\n\nThe book of Revelation describes eschatological accounts when the enmity \n\nbetween human and serpent race escalates into an open conflict: \"...And there \n\nwas war in heaven: Michael fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought \n\nand his angels... and the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called \n\nthe Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world...\" (Rev. 12:love:)\n\nThere are other interesting biblical references to serpents and dragons in \n\nPsalms 44:19, 74:13, 148:love:, Issaiah 13:22, etc.\n\nIndia: Nagas of the Underworld\n\nThe Nagas are a race of serpent beings. Most often they manifest themselves \n\nwith half-man, half-serpent bodies, although sometimes they assume the shape \n\nof a dragon, or appear in the guise of a cobra. They can take many different \n\nforms including snakes, humans with snake tails and normal humans, often \n\nbeautiful maidens. A precious gem is embedded in their heads endowing them \n\nwith supernatural powers including invisibility. Some are demoniac, some \n\nneutral or sometimes helpful.\n\nNagas are divided into four classes: heavenly, divine, earthly or hidden, \n\ndepending upon their function in guarding the heavenly palace, bringing \n\nrainfall, draining rivers or guarding treasures.\n\nIn Burma, the Nagas combine elements of the dragon, snake and crocodile. They \n\nhave guarded and protected several royal Burmese personages. They also give \n\nrubies to those they favor.\n\nThey inhabit lakes and rivers, but their real domain is a vast underground \n\nregion called Bila-svarga, or subterranean heavens. There they guard great \n\namounts of jewels and precious metals. Here they dwell with their seductive \n\nmates, the Naginis who sometimes seduce humans.\n\nOne such account is to be found for example in the Mahabharata. Arjuna, the \n\nson of King Pandu, was \"abducted\" by Ulupi, the Naga princess who enamored \n\nhim, into the parallel realm in the river Ganges near Hardwar. After spending \n\na night with her and begetting a son called Iravan, he returned back. This \n\nincident is also mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana 9.22.32. R. Thompson in his \n\nbook \"Alien Identities\" uses this account to give an example of parallel \n\ndimensions.\n\nThe Mahabharata story follows:\n\n\"When his residence was thus crowded with divinity, the darling son of Pandu \n\nand Kunti then went down into the Ganges water, to be consecrated for holy \n\nrite. Taking his ritual bath and worshiping his forefathers, Arjuna, happy to \n\ntake his part in the rite of fire, was rising out of the water, O king, when \n\nhe was pulled back in by Ulupi, the virgin daughter of the serpent king, who \n\ncould travel about at her will and was now within those waters. Holding onto \n\nhim, she pulled him down into the land of the Nagas, into her father's house.\n\n\"Arjuna then saw in the most honorable house of the Naga king, whose name was \n\nKauravya, a carefully attended fire. Dhananjaya Arjuna, son of Kunti, took \n\nover the duty of the fire, and without hesitation he made the offering and \n\nsatisfied the sacred flames. Having done the duty to the fire, the son of \n\nKunti then said laughingly to the daughter of the Naga king, \"Why have you \n\nacted so boldly, O shy and beautiful woman? What is the name of this opulent \n\nland? Who are you and whose daughter are you?\"\n\n\"Ulupi said: \"There is a serpent named Kauravya, born in the family of \n\nAiravata. I am his daughter, O Partha, and my name is Ulupi, lady of the \n\nsnakes. I saw you, Kaunteya, when you went down into the waters to take your \n\nritual bath, and I was stunned by Cupid. O Kuru child, now that the god of \n\nlove has stirred me up so, you must welcome me, for I have no one else, and I \n\nhave given myself to you in a secluded place.\"\n\n\"Arjuna said: \"Dharmaraja Yudhisthira has instructed me to practice celibacy \n\nfor twelve months, and I agreed; thus I am not my own master. I would like to \n\nplease you, but I have never spoken an untruth. How can I avoid a lie and also \n\nplease you, snake woman? If it could be done without hurting my religious \n\nprinciples, then I would do it.\"\n\n\"Ulupi said: \"I understand, son of Pandu, how you are wandering the earth, and \n\nhow your elder brother has instructed you to practice celibacy: \"There will be \n\na mutual accord that if any one of us mistakenly intrudes upon the others \n\nduring their time with Drupada's daughter, then he must remain in the forest \n\nfor twelve months as a celibate brahmacari.\" That was the agreement you all \n\nmade. But this exile you agreed upon is in regards to Draupadi. You all \n\naccepted the religious vow to be celibate in relation to her, and so your \n\nreligious vow is not violated here with me.\n\n\"Your eyes are very big and handsome, and it is your duty to rescue those who \n\nare in pain. Save me now, and there will be no breach of your religious \n\nprinciples. And even if there is some very subtle transgression of your \n\nreligious principles, then let this be religious rule, Arjuna, that you gave \n\nme back my life. My lord, accept me as I have accepted you, for it will be an \n\nact approved by decent people; And if you will not accept me, then know that I \n\nam a dead woman. O strong-armed one, practice the greatest virtue, which is \n\nthe act of giving life. I come to you now for shelter, for you are an ideal \n\nman.\n\n\"Kaunteya, you always take care of the poor and helpless people, and I have \n\ngone straight to you for shelter and am crying out in pain. I beg you, for my \n\ndesire is so strong. Therefore you must please me by giving yourself; it is \n\nproper for you to make me a satisfied woman.\n\n\"Sri Vaisampayana said: \"Thus addressed by the virgin daughter of the serpent \n\nlord, the son of Kunti, basing his actions on the religious law, did for her \n\nall that she desired. The fiery hero Arjuna spent the night in the palace of \n\nthe Naga king, and when the sun rose he too rose up from Kauravya's abode.\"\n\nSimilar story is recorded in the Harivansha, which is the addendum to the \n\nMahabharata. Yadu, the founder of the Yadava family, went for a trip to the \n\nsea, where he was carried off by Dhumavarna, king of the serpents, to the \n\ncapital of the serpents. Dhumavarna married his five daughters to Yadu, and \n\nfrom them sprang seven distinct families of people.\n\nKumudvati, the Naga princess, married Kusha, the son of Rama, as described in \n\nthe scripture Raghuvansha.\n\nThe following account touches upon the issue of underground hominoid-sauroid \n\nconflicts.\n\nThe Vishnu Purana speaks about the Gandharvas, descendants of sage Kashyapa \n\nand his wife Muni. Therefore they are also called Mauneyas. (According to \n\nHindu Dictionary by Manurishi Foundation, the Mauneyas are a class of \n\nGandharvas, who dwell beneath the earth, and are sixty millions in number.) \n\nThey were fighting with the Nagas in the subterranean regions, whose dominions \n\nthey seized and whose treasures they plundered. The Naga chiefs appealed to \n\nVishnu for relief, and He promised to appear in the person of Purukutsa, son \n\nof King Mandhata, to help them. Thereupon the Nagas sent their sister Narmada \n\nto this Purukutsa, and she conducted him to the regions below, where he \n\ndestroyed the Gandharvas. (According to the Ramayana similar Gandharvas were \n\ndefeated by Bharata, the brother of Rama, and Hanuman.) The ninth khanda of \n\nthe Bhagavata Purana also briefly mentions this story.\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana narration is based on the incident which happened to King \n\nPariksit. He was cursed by a young brahmana to die within seven days as a \n\nresult of a snakebite. The boy thought the king had offended his father, who \n\ndid not welcome the king in his ashrama being absorbed in deep meditation. \n\nThus the king left after putting a dead snake on sage's shoulder. The king \n\ndecided to accept the curse as a will of providence and sat down at the bank \n\nof Ganges to prepare for his death. At that time the great young sage Shuka, \n\nthe son of Vyasa, arrived there and the king asked him to explain the most \n\nimportant knowledge meant for a person about to die. Thus the sage started to \n\nnarrate the great Purana. As a result the king attained self-realization.\n\nHis son Janamejaya, however, became angry at the serpents and to revenge his \n\nfather's death he started a great sacrifice meant to destroy all the serpents \n\nbut later he stopped it to please the sage Astika, their relative. (Astika's \n\nfather was the sage Jaratkaru who married Manasa, the sister of the Naga king \n\nVasuki.) The whole story is narrated in the Mahabharata, Adi Parva.\n\nThe origin of the Naga race is described in the Mahabharata, Adi Parva:\n\n\"Long ago, in the godly millennium, Prajapati Daksha had two brilliant and \n\nsinless daughters, amazing sisters who were gifted with great beauty. Named \n\nKadru and Vinata, they both became wives of the primordial sage Kashyapa, a \n\nhusband who was equal in glory to the Prajapati. Being pleased with his \n\nreligious wive, Kashyapa, with much happiness, offered them both a boon. \n\nHearing of Kashyapa's joyful intention to let them choose an extraordinary \n\nboon, the two excellent women felt an incomparable joy.\n\n\"Kadru chose to create one thousand serpent sons, all of equal strength, and \n\nVinata hankered to have two sons who would exceed all of Kadru's sons in \n\nstamina, strength, valor, and spiritual influence. Her husband awarded her \n\nonly one and a half of these desired sons, knowing that she could not have \n\nmore. Vinata then said to Kashyapa, \"Let me have at least one superior son.\"\n\n\"Vinata felt that her purpose was satisfied and that somehow both sons would \n\nbe of superior strength. Kadru too felt her purpose fulfilled, since she would \n\nhave one thousand sons of equal prowess. Both wives were delighted with their \n\nboons. Then Kashyapa, that mighty ascetic, urging them to carry their embryos \n\nwith utmost care, retired to the forest.\n\n\"After a long time Kadru produced one thousand eggs, O leader of brahmanas, \n\nand Vinata produced two eggs. Their delighted assistants placed the two \n\nsisters' eggs in moist vessels, where they remained for five hundred years. \n\nWhen the years had passed, the sons of Kadru hatched from their eggs, but from \n\nVinata's two eggs her two sons were not to be seen. That austere and godly \n\nwoman, anxious to have children, was ashamed. Thus Vinata broke open one egg \n\nand saw therein her son. Authorities say that the upper half of the child's \n\nbody was fully developed, but the lower half was not yet well formed.\"\n\nThis son was Aruna, the charioteer of Surya, the sun god. His brother was the \n\npowerful Garuda, divine eagle, who became the carrier of Vishnu. Garuda is an \n\navowed enemy of serpents who are his food. Krishna mentions him among the most \n\nprominent representatives of His power: \"Among the Daitya demons I am the \n\ndevoted Prahlada, among subduers I am time, among beasts I am the lion, and \n\namong birds I am Garuda.\" (Bhagavad-gita 10.30)\n\nNilamata Purana, the ancient history of Kashmir, is centered around the \n\noriginal inhabitants of Kashmir, the Nagas. In the verses 232-233 it mentions \n\ntheir capital: \"O Naga, the dwelling of the Nagas is the city named Bhogavati. \n\nHaving become a Yogi that Naga-chief (Vasuki) dwells there as well as here. \n\nBut with his primary body, Vasuki, protecting the Nagas, shall live in \n\nBhogavati. O sinless one, you (also) dwell here constantly.\" Bhogavati is also \n\nmentioned in the Bhagavata Purana 1.11.11. Its another name is Putkari.\n\nBhagavata Purana gives the following description of Bila-svarga, the \n\nsubterranean regions compared for their opulence to heaven (5.24.7-15):\n\n\"My dear King, beneath this earth are seven other planets, known as Atala, \n\nVitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala and Patala. I have already \n\nexplained the situation of the planetary systems of earth. The width and \n\nlength of the seven lower planetary systems are calculated to be exactly the \n\nsame as those of earth.\n\n\"In these seven planetary systems, which are also known as the subterranean \n\nheavens <bila-svarga>, there are very beautiful houses, gardens and places of \n\nsense enjoyment, which are even more opulent than those in the higher planets \n\nbecause the demons have a very high standard of sensual pleasure, wealth and \n\ninfluence. Most of the residents of these planets, who are known as Daityas, \n\nDanavas and Nagas, live as householders. Their wives, children, friends and \n\nsociety are all fully engaged in illusory, material happiness. The sense \n\nenjoyment of the demigods is sometimes disturbed, but the residents of these \n\nplanets enjoy life without disturbances. Thus they are understood to be very \n\nattached to illusory happiness.\n\n\"My dear King, in the imitation heavens known as bila-svarga there is a great \n\ndemon named Maya Danava, who is an expert artist and architect. He has \n\nconstructed many brilliantly decorated cities. There are many wonderful \n\nhouses, walls, gates, assembly houses, temples, yards and temple compounds, as \n\nwell as many hotels serving as residential quarters for foreigners. The houses \n\nfor the leaders of these planets are constructed with the most valuable \n\njewels, and they are always crowded with living entities known as Nagas and \n\nAsuras, as well as many pigeons, parrots and similar birds. All in all, these \n\nimitation heavenly cities are most beautifully situated and attractively \n\ndecorated.\n\n\"The parks and gardens in the artificial heavens surpass in beauty those of \n\nthe upper heavenly planets. The trees in those gardens, embraced by creepers, \n\nbend with a heavy burden of twigs with fruits and flowers, and therefore they \n\nappear extraordinarily beautiful. That beauty could attract anyone and make \n\nhis mind fully blossom in the pleasure of sense gratification. There are many \n\nlakes and reservoirs with clear, transparent water, agitated by jumping fish \n\nand decorated with many flowers such as lilies, kuvalayas, kahlaras and blue \n\nand red lotuses. Pairs of cakravakas and many other water birds nest in the \n\nlakes and always enjoy in a happy mood, making sweet, pleasing vibrations that \n\nare very satisfying and conducive to enjoyment of the senses.\n\n\"Since there is no sunshine in those subterranean planets, time is not divided \n\ninto days and nights, and consequently fear produced by time does not exist.\n\n\"Many great serpents reside there with gems on their hoods, and the effulgence \n\nof these gems dissipates the darkness in all directions.\n\n\"Since the residents of these planets drink and bathe in juices and elixirs \n\nmade from wonderful herbs, they are freed from all anxieties and physical \n\ndiseases. They have no experience of grey hair, wrinkles or invalidity, their \n\nbodily lusters do not fade, their perspiration does not cause a bad smell, and \n\nthey are not troubled by fatigue or by lack of energy or enthusiasm due to old \n\nage.\n\n\"They live very auspiciously and do not fear death from anything but death's \n\nestablished time, which is the effulgence of the Sudarshana chakra of the \n\nSupreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\"When the Sudarshana disc enters those provinces, the pregnant wives of the \n\ndemons all have miscarriages due to fear of its effulgence.\"\n\n5.24.29-31:\n\n\"The planetary system below Talatala is known as Mahatala. It is the abode of \n\nmany-hooded snakes, descendants of Kadru, who are always very angry. The great \n\nsnakes who are prominent are Kuhaka, Taksaka, Kaliya and Susena. The snakes in \n\nMahatala are always disturbed by fear of Garuda, the carrier of Lord Vishnu, \n\nbut although they are full of anxiety, some of them nevertheless sport with \n\ntheir wives, children, friends and relatives.\n\n\"Beneath Mahatala is the planetary system known as Rasatala, which is the \n\nabode of the demoniac sons of Diti and Danu. They are called Panis, \n\nNivata-kavacas, Kaleyas and Hiranya-puravasis <those living in Hiranya-pura>. \n\nThey are all enemies of the demigods, and they reside in holes like snakes. \n\nFrom birth they are extremely powerful and cruel, and although they are proud \n\nof their strength, they are always defeated by the Sudarshana chakra of the \n\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, who rules all the planetary systems. When a \n\nfemale messenger from Indra named Sarama chants a particular curse, the \n\nserpentine demons of Mahatala become very afraid of Indra.\n\n\"Beneath Rasatala is another planetary system, known as Patala or Nagaloka, \n\nwhere there are many demoniac serpents, the masters of Nagaloka, such as \n\nShankha, Kulika, Mahashankha, Shveta, Dhananjaya, Dhrtarashtra, Shankhacuda, \n\nKambala, Ashvatara and Devadatta. The chief among them is Vasuki. They are all \n\nextremely angry, and they have many, many hoods - some snakes five hoods, some \n\nseven, some ten, others a hundred and others a thousand. These hoods are \n\nbedecked with valuable gems, and the light emanating from the gems illuminates \n\nthe entire planetary system of bila-svarga.\"\n\nDivine connection\n\nSerpents have their special place in most spiritual traditions (as already \n\nshown above) where they symbolize either good or evil. In the Vedic tradition \n\nthey are inherently related to some of its most important personages.\n\nShiva\n\nShiva (\"auspicious One\"), is one of the members of the trimurti (Brahma, \n\nVishnu and Shiva). He is in charge of the material mode of ignorance \n\n(tamo-guna) bringing destruction of the universe:\n\n\"Yamaraja said: My dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but \n\nfactually I am not. Above me, and above all the other demigods, including \n\nIndra and Candra, is the one supreme master and controller. The partial \n\nmanifestations of His personality are Brahma, Visnu and Siva, who are in \n\ncharge of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this universe. He is \n\nlike the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth. The \n\nentire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a rope in \n\nits nose.\" (Bhagavata Purana 6.3.12)\n\nHis position is between the living beings (jiva-tattva) and the Supreme Lord, \n\nVishnu (vishnu-tattva), in the category of his own, shiva-tattva.\n\nShiva is usually depicted in painting and sculpture as white or ash-colored, \n\nwith a blue neck (from holding in his throat the poison thrown up at the \n\nchurning of the cosmic ocean, which threatened to destroy humankind), his hair \n\narranged in a coil of matted locks (jatamakuta) and adorned with the crescent \n\nmoon and the Ganges (he allowed her to trickle through his hair). He has three \n\neyes, the third eye bestowing inward vision but capable of burning destruction \n\nwhen focused outward. He wears a garland of skulls and a serpent around his \n\nneck and carries in his two (sometimes four) hands a deerskin, a trident, a \n\nsmall hand drum, or a club with a skull at the end.\n\nHis paraphernalia symbolizes: moon - time measurement in months, three eyes - \n\ntri-kala-jna (\"knower of three phases of time - past, present, and future\"), \n\nsnake around the neck - time measurement in years, necklace of skulls with \n\nsnakes - changing of ages and begetting and annihilating of mankind. His \n\nassociation with the serpents is obvious from his epithets: Nagabhushana, \n\nVyalakalpa (\"having serpents as ornaments\"), Nagaharadhrik (\"wearing \n\nserpent-necklaces\"), Nagaraja, Nagendra, Nagesha (\"king of Nagas\"), Nakula \n\n(\"mongoose,\" one who is immune from the serpent venom), Vyalin (\"one who \n\npossesses snakes\"), etc. Shiva is the main object of worship at Benares under \n\nthe name Vishveshvara (\"master of the universe\").\n\nOne of his features is time (Bhagavad-gita 11.32: \"Time I am,\" Bhagavata \n\nPurana 3.5.26-27, Brahma-samhita 5.10), the separating factor between the \n\nmaterial and spiritual world (Bhagavata Purana 3.10.12) and a medium to \n\nperceive the Lord's influence (Bhagavata Purana 3.26.16).\n\nShiva's female consort is known under various names as Uma, Sati, Parvati, \n\nDurga, Kali, and Shakti. The divine couple, together with their sons - the \n\nsix-headed Skanda and the elephant-headed Ganesha - are inhabiting the Mount \n\nKailasa in the Himalayas as well as the Mahesha-dhama on the border of the \n\nmaterial world (Devi-dhama) and the spiritual world (Vaikuntha or Hari-dhama).\n\nIn the Brahma-samhita he is said to be another form of Maha-Vishnu, and is \n\ncompared to a yogurt. Yogurt is nothing but milk, yet it is not milk. As \n\nyogurt is prepared when milk is mixed with a culture, the form of Shiva \n\nexpands when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in touch with material \n\nnature. Since Shiva and Vishnu are aspects of one God, Shiva occurs as one of \n\nVishnu's names listed in the Vishnu-sahasranama.\n\nThe original father, Krishna, says, aham bija-pradah pita: \"I am the \n\nseed-giving father.\" That pita (father) is Lord Shiva, Shambhu, and material \n\nnature (goddess Durga) is considered the mother. By their sexual union are all \n\nconditioned souls inserted into the material nature. The impregnation of \n\nmaterial nature is wonderful because at one time innumerable living beings are \n\nconceived. Bhago jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate (Shvetashvatara \n\nUpanishad 5.9). In this way Shiva is connected with both creation and \n\ndestruction. Because of his marginal position between material and spiritual \n\nrealm he is seemingly full of contradictions but these are reconciled on the \n\ntranscendental level.\n\nAnanta Shesha\n\nSome of the Nagas are many-headed. Ananta, also called Shesha, the king of the \n\nNagas, has unlimited heads. According to the Bhagavata Purana 5.25.3, He is \n\nthe source of Rudra, an expansion of Shiva. When Krishna lists the most \n\nprominent representatives of His power, He says, ananta casmi naganam - \"among \n\nthe Nagas I am Ananta\" (Bhagavad-gita 10.29).\n\n\"My dear Lord, at the end of each millennium <here Brahma's life> the Supreme \n\nPersonality of Godhead Garbhodakashayi Vishnu dissolves everything manifested \n\nwithin the universe into His belly. He lies down on the lap of Shesha Naga, \n\nfrom His navel sprouts a golden lotus flower on a stem, and on that lotus Lord \n\nBrahma is created. I can understand that You are the same Supreme Godhead. I \n\ntherefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.\" (Bhagavata Purana 4.9.14)\n\nAnanta is called Shesha as He is the residue or remainder of the universe \n\nduring cosmic dissolutions. He is elaborately described in the Bhagavata \n\nPurana, 5th khanda, chapter 25. Ultimately He will destroy the world: \"At the \n\ntime of the final devastation of the complete universe <the end of the \n\nduration of Brahma's life>, a flame of fire emanates from the mouth of Ananta \n\n(...). (Bhagavata Purana 2.2.26)\n\nSage Patanjali, the author of Yoga-sutras, is considered by some to be an \n\nincarnation of Shesha. He is the author of the Mahabhashya, the celebrated \n\ncommentary on the Grammar of Panini, and a defense of that work against the \n\ncriticisms of philosopher Katyayana. His name allegedly represents that he \n\nfell as a small snake from heaven into the palm of Panini (pata - fallen, \n\nanjali - palm).\n\nSouth Indian Vaishnava philosopher and spiritual leader Ramanuja (11th \n\ncentury) is also considered an incarnation of Shesha.\n\nBalarama\n\n\"The foremost manifestation of Krishna is Sankarshana, who is known as Ananta. \n\nHe is the origin of all incarnations within this material world. Previous to \n\nthe appearance of Lord Krishna, this original Sankarshana will appear as \n\nBaladeva, just to please the Supreme Lord Krishna in His transcendental \n\npastimes.\" (Bhagavata Purana 10.1.24)\n\n\"According to expert opinion, Balarama, as the chief of the original quadruple \n\nforms, is also the original Sankarshana. Balarama, the first expansion of \n\nKrishna, expands Himself in five forms: (1) Maha-Sankarshana, (2) \n\nKaranabdhishayi, (3) Garbhodakashayi, (4) Kshirodakashayi, and (5) Shesha. \n\nThese five plenary portions are responsible for both the spiritual and \n\nmaterial cosmic manifestations. In these five forms Lord Balarama assists Lord \n\nKrishna in His activities. The first four of these forms are responsible for \n\nthe cosmic manifestations, whereas Shesha is responsible for personal service \n\nto the Lord. Shesha is called Ananta, or unlimited, because He assists the \n\nPersonality of Godhead in His unlimited expansions by performing an unlimited \n\nvariety of services. Shri Balarama is the servitor Godhead who serves Lord \n\nKrishna in all affairs of existence and knowledge. Lord Nityananda Prabhu, who \n\nis the same servitor Godhead, Balarama, performs the same service to Lord \n\nGauranga by constant association.\" (Chaitanya Charitamrta, Adi-lila 5.10, \n\npurport by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada)\n\nBalarama appeared as Krishna's older brother and took part in Krishna's \n\nchildhood pastimes in Vrindavana. He is the first direct expansion of Krishna. \n\nBalarama only had one wife, Revati, daughter of King Raivata, and by her He \n\nhad two sons, Nishatha and Ulmuka. He is represented as having fair \n\ncomplexion, and clad in a dark-blue vest (nilavastra). His special weapons are \n\nthe club (khetaka or saunanda), the plow (hala), and the pestle (musala). Thus \n\nHe is called Phala, Hala, Halayudha (\"plow-armed\"), Halabhrit, Langali \n\n(\"plow-bearer\"), Sankarshana (\"one who attracts everything\"), Musali \n\n(\"pestle-holder\"). As he has a palm for a banner, he is called Taladhvaja. He \n\nrepresents guru-tattva, the principle of spiritual master.\n\n\"May the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Dhanvantari \n\nrelieve me from undesirable eatables and protect me from physical illness. May \n\nLord Rsabhadeva, who conquered His inner and outer senses, protect me from \n\nfear produced by the duality of heat and cold. May Yajna protect me from \n\ndefamation and harm from the populace, and may Lord Balarama as Shesha protect \n\nme from envious serpents.\" (Bhagavata Purana 6.8.18)\n\n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Freed from all sinful reactions are \n\nthose who rise from bed at the end of night, early in the morning, and fully \n\nconcentrate their minds with great attention upon My form; your form; this \n\nlake; this mountain; the caves; the gardens; the cane plants; the bamboo \n\nplants; the celestial trees; the residential quarters of Me, Lord Brahma and \n\nLord Shiva; the three peaks of Trikuta Mountain, made of gold, silver and \n\niron; My very pleasing abode <the ocean of milk>; the white island, \n\nShvetadvipa, which is always brilliant with spiritual rays; My mark of \n\nShrivatsa; the Kaustubha gem; My Vaijayanti garland; My club, Kaumodaki; My \n\nSudarshana disc and Pancajanya conchshell; My bearer, Garuda, the king of the \n\nbirds; My bed, Shesha Naga; My expansion of energy the goddess of fortune; \n\nLord Brahma; Narada Muni; Lord Shiva; Prahlada; My incarnations like Matsya, \n\nKurma and Varaha; My unlimited all-auspicious activities, which yield piety to \n\nhe who hears them; the sun; the moon; fire; the mantra omkara; the Absolute \n\nTruth; the total material energy; the cows and brahmanas; devotional service; \n\nthe wives of Soma and Kashyapa, who are all daughters of King Daksha; the \n\nRivers Ganges, Sarasvati, Nanda and Yamuna <Kalindi>; the elephant Airavata; \n\nDhruva Maharaja; the seven rshis; and the pious human beings.\" (Bhagavata \n\nPurana 8.4.17-24)\n\nAlthough Garuda enmity toward serpents is known from this verse it is clear \n\nthat both Garuda and Shesha Naga are servants of the Lord Vishnu, or Krishna.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough this overview of the position of a Serpent in different traditions is \n\nfar from exhaustive the conspicuous similarity of accounts from different \n\ncultural contexts hints that the Vedic tradition spread in the distant past \n\nover large parts of the world. This is also supported by the tradition itself.\n\nIn this article we have traced the Serpent in various traditions, places and \n\ncontexts which ultimately lead us to the transcendental realm. On this level \n\nthe duality of \"good\" and \"bad\" ceases to exist as everything is of absolute \n\nnature. This puts an end to the Serpent controversy.\n\nby ssssSt. ssssSerPentine",
