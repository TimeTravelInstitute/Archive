<br />
<br />
        The secret of warp capacities lies in knowing why the light speed<br />
limit exists.  Understanding this technology will require an advanced<br />
understanding of reletivity.  In simple, how was the light speed limit<br />
arrived at in the first place?  That is the point as which we, thusly I,<br />
should begin.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
        Reletivity is a fascinating concept in that it states that objective<br />
observation is really subjective.  For example, from a planet's viewpoint,<br />
it's star appears to be moving and the world looks stationary.  If we look<br />
at the same system from the viwpoint as the star, the planet appears to be<br />
moving.  From the viewpoint of the galaxy, both will appear to be moving<br />
compared to a &quot;reletively stationary&quot; galaxy.  And it goes on like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we question which of these is the truth.  The only reasonable<br />
answer to this question is that all of these observations, and countless<br />
others which I have not mentioned, are all true. How can a contradiction be<br />
the truth?  Reletively!  Since there is no single universal reference point<br />
which we can all agree upon as absolutely stationary, we cannot discern if<br />
any of these reference points is truely stationary.  All movement must be<br />
measured reletive to a &quot;reletively stationary&quot; reference point since there is<br />
no objectively stationary reference upon which to base all movement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This being said, we can refer to ourselves as stationary.  If you have<br />
ever moved about in a vehicle which moves at a smooth accelleration, then you<br />
have felt a phenominon which is the basis for reletivity.  You feel stationary<br />
and objects you see through the viewports appear to be moving.  Should your<br />
vehicle drift forward, reletive to the vehicle directly beside you, you may<br />
try to stop your forward momentum even if it is the other vehicle, your<br />
reletively stationary reference point, which is actually drifting backwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Although it appears that I'm off course in this dissertation, this is<br />
an important concept.  With the exception of reference points, designated<br />
stationary or moving, you have no sensory clue that you are moving.  This<br />
leads us to question what will happen if you were to have a clue to movement<br />
outside of the reference point?  Absolute proof of such a thing would topple<br />
reletivity as we know it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we come to a point where we have just such an experament.  Without<br />
the above assertion, we will not arrive at reletivity.  It is an absolute<br />
belief that there is no such sensory proof which will shatter the stationary<br />
illusion of SMOOTH accelleration which leads to reletivity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You hop into your space ship, and move off to the nearest star.  All<br />
the time, you accellerate smoothly to maintain a 1 G environment.  There is a<br />
mirror above you, perpendicular to the nosecone.  Clearely, the light from<br />
your face moves to the mirror at C-(ship's velocity) and bounces back at<br />
c+(Ship's velocity) .  If you were to keep going for so long that you reached<br />
the speed of light, C, then the light moving toward the mirror would be moving<br />
at C-C or 0 units per second.  Your reflection would vanish.  Suddenly, you<br />
have sensory proof that you're moving.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't let the C+C case of the light coming back at you escape notice<br />
either.  The extancy of the constant C states that light has a fixed velocity<br />
through any medium, including the air of your ship.  As a result, light will<br />
always return from the mirror at C units per second.  Base a clock on this<br />
structure and something amazing will happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Assume that the clock is so large that a beam of light bouncing from<br />
the mirror would take 1 second to return.  That leads us to the equation that<br />
the distance to the mirror, D, is C/2 units.  The total speed of the light<br />
beam is C-V(Ship's velocity =V) for the outgoing leg and C for the incomming<br />
leg. ( C-V+C = 2C-V units per second)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point, we are using SPOTS &lt;Simultaneous Pulse Optical[BR&gt;Transmision System ] transponders, which can send and receive photon pulses<br />
from the same element.  It is important to note that this is isolinear in that<br />
the pulse moves directly forward in the exact direction that the ship is<br />
moving and moves directly back over the same path.  When the ship's velocity<br />
is C, then the photon pulses will move toward the mirror at the same speed as<br />
the mirror will be moving away from the SPOTS transponder.  The result is that<br />
time stops.  Up until this point, the return leg of the voyage taken by the<br />
photon pulse shortens by the same distance as the departing leg lengthens from<br />
the movement of the ship.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Even though all the points for a single, strait line, we have a<br />
triangle.  Now we do the experiment in the old way, where the sender and<br />
receiver elements of the photon pulse are side by side.  Now the photon pulse<br />
has to move across the ship as well as moving from front to back along the<br />
ship.  Something interesting happens.  The beam is moving toward the receiver<br />
throughout it's entire flight, thus, if the flight to the mirror is lengthened<br />
by the movement of the ship, this pulse hits the mirror off center.  If the<br />
mirror is not wide enough to reach between the centers of both the sender and<br />
receiver, then there is a speed at which the beam would miss the mirror.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This leads to an odd perception in which you, unaware that there is<br />
any reletive momentum, see space warping in the mirror.  Suddenly, you can<br />
see further to one side of the room, beside you, than you could.  It's a slow<br />
process, depending on the velocity increase during this time, however, you<br />
could eventually see the side of objects which face the mirror. Note, that any<br />
change in reletive velocity voids the guarantee of reletivity.  Acceleration,<br />
as used in this paper, refers to the movement of the bodies involved and not<br />
to a change in velocity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And now we get to the transverse experiment.  The mirror is now<br />
mounted on the port side, with the sender and receivers mounted at opposite<br />
ends of the Starboard wall.  The receiver is at the front of the ship and the<br />
sender is at the tail.  Now, viewed from outside, the photon pulse has to<br />
catch up with the mirror, and then catch up with the receiver.  If we were to<br />
compute the distance as viewed from outside the ship, it would be much further<br />
from the sender to the receiver, off the mirror, than it is from the inside of<br />
the ship.  Time is slowed. Interestingly, the opposite will happen if the beam<br />
was to be fired the other way, from front to back.  Time speeds up moving in<br />
that direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This stretching of time is spacial reletivity.  If we were to compute<br />
the triangle formed by the sender, mirror and receiver, it would be possible<br />
to arrive at the remarkable E=MC^2 as the amount of energy contained in 'dead<br />
mass,' but that is not our current concern, so we'll skip the exercise.  Yet,<br />
it is important to note that this formula expresses only the energy in the<br />
mass and not the energies which can be stored in it.  Heat, kenetic and the<br />
like are added to this.  That is important because the increase in kenetic<br />
energy as we approach C adds to the apparent mass of the body and is part of<br />
why we cannot exceed C within Normal N-Space &lt;time-space&gt;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The slowing down of time and the reletive increase in mass are the<br />
real reasons that FTL &lt;Faster than Light&gt; drive is considered impossible.  It<br />
is important that you know these effects, however, it is not important that<br />
we discuss them at length because they must NOT apply in the processes<br />
outlined in this paper or FTL drive, all of warp technology, will be<br />
invalidated.<br />
&lt;HR&gt;<br />
&lt;H1&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;           Starting Point.. &lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br />
<br />
                        ----------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Notice another odd effect.  All falling bodies are conducted through<br />
space at the same velocity under a gravitational accelleration.  Weight, and<br />
mass, seem to have no effect on gravitational accelleration.  This simple<br />
observation is the beginning of inertial bias, field accelleration and full<br />
blown spacial warping.  Although inertia is added to these bodies while they<br />
are in reletive free-fall, there is no difference in the way that the field<br />
of gravity reacts as a result of this increase.  In fact, the increase in<br />
mass which results from high velocity momentum actually adds strength to the<br />
gravitic field it generates.<br />
&lt;HR&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;H1&gt;<br />
              Reducing Inertia to a Speed.&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br />
<br />
              ----------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Matter is comprised of many small components which act as larger<br />
singular structures.  The exact nature of these components is purely<br />
theoretical, although it is known that such structures contain energy<br />
contained within quantum fields.  This of genesit particles, particles on the<br />
boundry between matter and energy such as photons, as bubbles of quantum<br />
forces which are full of pure energy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you wish to accellerate such constructions, you will notice that<br />
the whole structure will deform as the intertial forces along some connections<br />
propogate.  Inertia itself is an expression of this deformation in the way<br />
that the attempt to accelerate the body in one inertial state must move<br />
through the body and reach each component of the body in order for it to reach<br />
a stable rate of movement.  Clearely, the speed of inertia is the speed of<br />
sound through the medium in question.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the force which is applied to change the inertial state of a<br />
body is applied to a small portion of the body, the components of the body<br />
adjacent to that point will be moving reletively faster than the remaining<br />
portions of the body.  Contraction along the body will result in something<br />
called inertial compression which can cause stress failures in the mechanical<br />
and structural systems of the body in question.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound, like accelleration, is a compressional wave, thusly, the speed<br />
of sound increases proportionally to the density of the medium.  This velocity<br />
is not a matter of the compressability of the medium as virtually<br />
incompressable materials, the basis of hydrolic systems, experience the same<br />
increase in the speed of sound reletive to density.  Such compression is,<br />
rather, the ability of the medium to conduct isolinear momentum without<br />
excessive dispersion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
An increase in the speed of sound through a body does not result in<br />
the loss of inertia.  Conversely, it results in the increase in inertia since<br />
the entire body must be moved by the applied force, at the moment of inertia,<br />
rather than the applied force simply changing the inertial state of small<br />
parts of the body in any moment until the whole body is in its new, steady,<br />
inertial state.  This can be conveniently expressed as F=MA where force is the<br />
mass of the body times the acceleration.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
F/A=M therefore, the higher the inertial conduction (acceleration),<br />
the lower the mass which can be accelerated by it.  This action is also time<br />
dependant, posessing the property of quantum energy.  Quantum energy requires<br />
that the whole quantum of energy required to change a state must be applied<br />
in one instant or it will have no effect on the system.  There is never a<br />
'residual' in quantum energy.  None of the 'excess' energy from one moment is<br />
available to change the state of the body in the next moment.<br />
&lt;HR&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;H1&gt;<br />
                        Field Accelleration&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br />
<br />
                        -------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we reach the first principle of warp technology.  The main reason<br />
we exceed the light speed limit is inertia.  As a body approaches the light<br />
speed limit, C, it's mass will increase exponentially up to infinity at C.<br />
Our second problem is the 'time slip' which states that time must stand still<br />
to a body moving at C or the principle of reletivity will be violated.  I'll<br />
get to the second problem later.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Field accelleration refers to the accelleration of the body by<br />
applying the momentum to the components which make up the body rather than to<br />
the body itself.  The difference may seem small, however, it is profound.  In<br />
older forms of propulsion, force is applied from the power plants and is<br />
subject to inertia as it propogates through the body to change its inertial<br />
state.  With a field accelerator, the body is emersed in the field and biased<br />
to a certain inertial state.  There is no inertial effect since the force does<br />
not have to propogate across the body.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any quantum force of sufficient capacity can produce a warp field.<br />
Gravitation is the most often expressed force, however, electormagnetism is<br />
the most used force since it is the most controllable and understood.  It is<br />
also important to note that electroweak force, of which electromagnetic force<br />
is a subset, is kenetic whereas gravitostrong force is static.  Static forces<br />
are difficult to bias and often require an actual imbalance in the field to<br />
achieve the warp effect.  Kenetic forces have a polarity and can easily be<br />
biased in their natural flows without applying undue stress to the structure<br />
of the body involved.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Handling the 'time slip' problem is the most complex part of the<br />
system.  Although the field is external to the body and does not experience<br />
the distortion of time in itself, the body contained within the field have to<br />
cope with displacement as movement across vast distances in space result in<br />
movement through equally vast amounts of time.  This is an unacceptable<br />
consequince of warp travel.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Field acceleration handles this as well.  The body within the field<br />
experiences no inertia and is therefore in a state of stable inertia all the<br />
time.  Such bodies are moving at sublight velocities sufficiently small as not<br />
to experience time slip.  It is the surrounding space which is warped by the<br />
allererator field.  Quantum accleration of the entire field frame compresses<br />
space in an isolinear fassion.  <br />
&lt;HR&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;H1&gt;<br />
                        Time Dilation&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br />
<br />
                        -------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Two types of time disruption occur in faster than light (FTL) space<br />
flight; virtual and actual.  Actual time dilation is the difference between<br />
the reletive 'speed' of time within the warp field and time measured outside<br />
the field.  Virtual time displacement is the apparent change in time resulting<br />
from moving into space over distances so vast that your point of departure<br />
appears to move backward in time and your destination seems to move forward in<br />
time by an equally great distance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Virtual time displacement is the one which cannot be solved at present<br />
and the simpler of the two to describe, so I'll start there.  Since light<br />
moves at a constant velocity, moving faster than light will require light<br />
which leaves your point of origin at the present time to have to catch up with<br />
you.  That means that you could see yourself leaving port by stopping at the<br />
right point and using a powerfull enough theoretical telescope. If your<br />
departure was broadcast to your destination, about a light week into space,<br />
you could watch yourself leave your point of origin almost week after you<br />
arrived at your destination!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since higher life is also social life, this displacement has a real<br />
effect on the mental state of star age (Ketueen) races.  When you arrive at<br />
your destination, only hours after you leave port, a week would appear to have<br />
passed even though you did not really slip through time.  The real<br />
displacement is that your only contact between these points will have been<br />
limited to light speed limited communications.  This means less in the age of<br />
subspace radio, however, radio doesn't correct for your vision.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You see your point of origin moving back in time as you leave and your<br />
destination moving forward as you approach it.  At one time, this form of<br />
isolation posed a mental health threat to colonists.  They would sometimes<br />
look out into space and see a time before their home star was created.  Radio<br />
wasn't fast enough to counter this effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actual time disruption results in the dilation of time within the<br />
cabin of your ship as a result of it's forward momentum.  We reduce this by<br />
compressing space along isolinear chanels between navigational points so that<br />
we can move through space at sublight speeds while covering lightyears in<br />
seconds.  This dilation cannot be completely neutralized because the ship will<br />
be moving and ANY velocity results in this effect.  N-Stable drive compensates<br />
better than the I-Fix system, but the dilation is still there.<br />
&lt;HR&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;H1&gt;<br />
                      I-Fix Drive systems.&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br />
<br />
                      --------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Common warp drive units are in the I-Fix class since they do not<br />
involve moving through alternate dimensional vortexes.  They are fixed in<br />
N-space which is the same 4-dimensional time-space within which the ship<br />
originated.  These drive units rely on the principles of field accelleration<br />
to produce short-cuts between navigational points.  This works by producing<br />
strong enough quantum fields along an isolinear corridor to produce an<br />
apparent shortening of linear space between two points in N-space.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This effect is largely an illusion.  Space itself does not really<br />
fold.  The quantum field projected to appear just ahead of the body to be<br />
conducted along the warp chanel really accellerates the body in such a way<br />
that no inertia is experienced, thus it appears that space is moving and not<br />
the body being conducted along the chanel.  As a result, the body within the<br />
field 'tricks' N-space into refreshing the structure of the body at a distance<br />
from where it could actually have been while bounded by the light speed limit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I-Fix drive mechanics is a combination between superstring theory and<br />
aether theory.  Aether theory is the older of the two and was thought to have<br />
been disproven long ago, until revived by corrolaries of superstring theory<br />
and reletivity.  Superstring theory is essential to warp dynamics in that it<br />
allows the bodies involved to be conducted along the warp chanel as the energy<br />
they are made of rather than as completed structures.  If this was not<br />
possible, the quantum fields required to producte the warp effect would crush<br />
the body being conducted along them.  Such bodies must be absorbed into the<br />
fields during movement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aether theory expresses a material, called aether, through which<br />
magnetic waves propogate.  Gravity is expressed as the consumption of aether<br />
by mass, kind of like the 'vacuum' produced near the drain plug of a tub.<br />
Superstring theory expands on this to say that the aether is not consumed, but<br />
that it oscillates into another dimension to return at another point where<br />
there is reletively no mass.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Superstring theory is drawn from the fact that all 'solid particles'<br />
of matter can be diffracted by the 'double slit experament.'  This indicates<br />
that subatomic particles are not solid, but standing waves.  That leads to a<br />
new view of reality in that nothing is really solid.  Warp theory draws from<br />
this to allow for a quantum field to be constructed along a field-frame such<br />
that the body within the field is indistinguishable from the field.  At that<br />
point, the body cannot be destroyed by the field because there is no<br />
difference between the field and the body.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Reletivity also helps here.  Imagine that there are two stars, one on<br />
each horizon from where you are standing on a planet.  Your planet is orbiting<br />
its star away from one star and toward the other.  Since the speed of light<br />
must be a constant, and you would see it as higher on the star you are moving<br />
toward, there must be extra space compressed along the leading edge of your<br />
orbit to account for the additional distance the light from that star has to<br />
traverse to stay at a fixed speed.  Likewise, there has to be a stretching of<br />
space so that the light from the star you are moving away from does not appear<br />

                                N-Stable Systems.&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br />
<br />
                                -----------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
N-Stable drive units rely on the existence of dimensions which run<br />
along the same plane as N-Space yet have important differing properties.  For<br />
example, hyperspace is a dimension which is essentially empty and has no light<br />
speed limit.  These dimensions must run along the same plane as N-Space so<br />
that re-entry is possible after the distance required is traversed.  The<br />
extancy of such planes is not beyond the reach of probability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Extra-dimentional travel for short distances requires entry into a<br />
plane which matches the state of N-Space adequately for the survival of the<br />
passengers of the vehicle making the journey and a shift in phase which<br />
produces an effect which can be mapped onto N-Space as faster than light<br />
momentum for a fixed period of time.  The survival aspect of the requirements<br />
is understandable.  Mapping an effect onto N-Space as a fixed period of FTL<br />
movement is a bit more complex, but the entire process wouldn't be worth much<br />
without it.  Why bother using N-Stable drive if you cannot get anywhere you<br />
couldn't get just as easily without it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hyperspacial travel is a limited subset of wormhole travel.  A tunnel<br />
is created between two distant points in N-Space and the body travesing that<br />
distance jumps into it.  This is a subset of wormhole travel, and not real<br />
wormhole travel, since a wormhole has no real length.  True wormholes are<br />
direct connections between distant points in N-Space which can connect without<br />
regard for time or spacial distance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wormholes are like mirrors running in reverse.  You look at a mirror<br />
from the side and the mirror is an maybe inch thick.  The reflection in the<br />
mirror is close to two dimensional, and should be two dimensional.  Looking<br />
at the mirror from the front will yeild a reconstruction of 4 dimensional<br />
N-Space within the apparent space of the reflection.  There is no true limit<br />
to the amount of space which can appear in this 2-D matrix.  It will appear as<br />
large as the space being reflected by the mirror, and last as long as the unit<br />
of space being reflected.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With a wormhole, the effect is reversed.  You look into the wormhole<br />
and see the N-Space at a great, or not so great, distance from your current<br />
location.  It could be across the room or across the universe.  From the side,<br />
these locations will be separated by much more distance than they are through<br />
the wormhole.  Apparently, the length of the womrhole from the outside is<br />
many times as great as the distance within the wormhole.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Moving through the wormhole requires a reletive dimensional stabalizer.<br />
Any warp capable ship will be able to use the inertial field accellerator as<br />
a stabalizer and enter the wormhole.  The real problem being that wormholes<br />
are are dimensionally unstable with a tendancy to collapse across any particle<br />
of solid matter which enters them.  This effect is due to the quantum folding<br />
of N-Space which causes solid matter to hold its shape.  Warp fields reduce<br />
the body within them into a single field frame which appears to be a<br />
collection of genesit particles held suspended across a magnetic matrix.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hyperspace uses wormholes to move into a paralell dimensional space<br />
which can be reletively smaller than N-Space or where the light speed limit<br />
does not exist.  Since these dimensions overlap N-Space at every point,<br />
movement along these planes will allow you to re-enter N-Space through another<br />
generated wormhole at a distance so great that light could not cover the same<br />
distance in the same time frame.  The case where space is reletively smaller<br />
is the most like standard I-Fix drive, but it is not the only application of<br />
compressed space.  It is possible that the dimensions on the space you jump to<br />
can be twisted in such a way that your ports are directly adjacent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Perihelion is the most extreme case of spacial compression.  In this<br />
case, only a single point covers all of N-Space.  From perihelion, you can<br />
return to N-Space at any point in space-time without limits.  This is the<br />
domain of a special breed of FLT drive called star-navigation.  Bodies moving<br />
through perihelion using star-navigation are de-actualized for entry and then<br />
re-actualized by the star-navigator at their destinations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Spaces where the light speed limit does not exist also has an extreme<br />
case.  It is possible that additional planes which overlap N-Space use the<br />
same time-space, however, they use it in differing orders.  For example, time<br />
spent in one of these dimensions maps back to distance traveled at light<br />
speed.  This is not all that impressive unless you realize that lateral<br />
movement maps back to time in N-Space, thusly the body can return to N-Space<br />
before it left.  Since velocity is a matter of distance and time, the light<br />
speed limit technically does not exist in these dimensions.<br />

Now that the cold theory is basically finished, or as far as I intend<br />
to go for now, we can get into reducing the cold theory to practice.  This is<br />
the exciting part even though it is really just a matter of math and<br />
demonstrations of the concepts expressed to this point.  You are still years<br />
from reducing the hard science expressed here to your own working drive units<br />
even if you understand everything in the remainder of this thesis.  That's why<br />
you spend years in the academy....<br />

RGFC:&lt;/U&gt;<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Long ago, the military was looking for a way to evade missile radar<br />
on ships.  The experamanet was called the &quot;Philidelphia Project.&quot;  It worked<br />
by using a huge military degauser which cloaked the ship in question within a<br />
huge magnetic field.  This ship was not onle radar invisible, but actually<br />
vanished, to reappear many miles from its starting point.  Thusly began the<br />
application of spacial warp technology.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A book was written in an attempt to explain why this happened, and the<br />
entertainment industry built a story around it so that most people didn't even<br />
know that there was a factual basis to the whole thing.  This was an excellent<br />
cover for the dissemination of information and for keeping the general public<br />
from knowing what was really going on.  All the truth was generally available<br />
and nobody who was uninitiated cared to look.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From there, an experament began circulating through the underground<br />
based on the infamous millitary project.  The file containing this experament<br />
is called &quot;RGFC&quot; for 'Reletive Gravity Field Control.'  &lt;Title breakdown is[BR&gt;unconfirmed as of this writing.]  This experament can be very hazardous if you<br />
are not fully prepared for the incredible heat it will generate, so extreeme<br />
caution should be used if you decide to go through with it.  You will be<br />
working with 50 Kev DC power systems flowing through coils and that is very<br />
hazardous.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
RGFC starts with a thermoplastic tube about two feet long and 8 inches<br />
in diameter.  A field coil is wound around this tube, and a second coil of<br />
equal capacity is placed within the tube.  This tube is sealed, with care to<br />
be sure it can handle a great deal of heat and pressure, after flooding with<br />
glycerin.  The glycerin was the optimal electrolyte for the system when the<br />
file was last updated.  Both the internal and the external coils are charged<br />
to 50 Kev (DC), and then a 25 Kev power supply is split between the coils.<br />
Each of these three power sources must be independant to avoid crosovers which<br />
will drain the effect of this field wave guide.  Connect the negative lead of<br />
the 25 Kev (DC) power supply to the negative pole of the central coil's power<br />
and the positive pole to the positive pole of the outer coil's feed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The original design called for a third coil to run through the exact<br />
center of the whole thing as an antenna to inject frequencies into the<br />
complete apperatus, however this has been replaced by looping a coil around<br />
the outside of the completed wave guide.  This newer design makes for better<br />
field control.  Structurally, the field guide is two electromagnetic coils<br />
with a capacitent field across them.  A central iron bar might amplify the<br />
effect, however, it will also be subject to the same effect as the cores in<br />
high voltage transformers and deform from the pulses in the huge magnetic<br />
field.  Powdered iron would be a better choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;U&gt;<br />
Pionizer:&lt;/U&gt;<br />
<br />
                        -------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on this design, I came to the pionization core system.  In<br />
essence, the pionization core is a more efficient and mineraturized version<br />
of the wave guide described in RGFC.  Three elements are used, each one acting<br />
as the wave guide listed above, placed in a cone shape.  Exact specifications<br />
of the pionization core are too sensitive to be released here, however, I must<br />
detail how to use the completed structure.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Each pionization element has two power leads, and a pointed end.  It<br />
takes three elements to form a completed pionization core, mounted about a<br />
circle so that the three elements are 120 degrees apart.  (equadistant.)  This<br />
assembly is tilted so that the pointed ends, close to the center, but not<br />
touching, are above the assembly.  Antenna leads are fixed to the blunt end of<br />
each pionization element.  Three elements is the minimum which can be used to<br />
steer a phased array in 3-dimensions, and the angle of the elements adds to<br />
the controllability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The power leads of the three elements are tied together under the<br />
centeral ring, however, they must not enter the actual field produced.  Two of<br />
the elements are tied to the negative supply from the leads on the blunt end,<br />
with the third accepting the positive lead.  Keeping the points of the three<br />
elements close together allows the quantum disturbance to be maintained within<br />
the tight magnetic bottle.<br />
<br />
&lt;PRE&gt;  &quot; /*\ &quot;  &quot; + /-\  - &quot; &lt;/PRE&gt;<br />
<br />

&lt;U&gt;<br />
Element 117 &lt;Neutronium&gt;&lt;/U&gt;<br />
<br />
                        ------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we need an intense power supply.  Scientists theorize that the<br />
elements of the periodic table, which become radioactively unstable at about<br />
cesium in the periodic table, eventually return to stable elements.  This<br />
happens at Neutronium, element 117.  Neutronium is a black metal of massive<br />
density and semiconductive properties in the same class as Carbon, Silicon and<br />
Germanium.  We know this from its placement on the periodic table.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How does this give us power?  Since element 117 is the first stable<br />
element in the periodic table, and decrease in the gravitostrong quantum field<br />
will result in spontaneous degeneration of neutronium into a mass of matter<br />
and anti-matter.  This degradation is so fast that the inertia of the<br />
surrounding air is great enough to contain all but the magnetic energy<br />
emissions.  Since this is conducted across the pionization field, we can tap<br />
the power easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a missmatch in this form of matter anti-matter reaction which<br />
yeilds genesit particles.  Positive matter and anti-matter do not have the<br />
same mass.  Such an imbalance limits the stable state of the fuel burned in<br />
the reactor.  Overburning will result in the build up of genesit particles and<br />
possible mass residue formation.  Caution must be taken to keep the engines<br />
burning clean.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Element 117 is not the only element which can be burned in this way,<br />
however, as it is the densest element easily effected by this process, it will<br />
result in the highest energy production.  Heating the fuel increases the total<br />
energy production since it produces a corresponding reduction in nuclear<br />
stability before fuel burn is initiated.  This reaction is bottled by the<br />
quantum field containment system and thusly is not constrained by the low<br />
pressure requirement of magnetically bottled mass anti-mass reactors.<br />
&lt;HR&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;H1&gt;<br />
                        Aether burners.&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br />
<br />
                        ---------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The oscillations of quantum mass in the aether is another source of<br />
quantum energy.  Since aether theory makes atoms themselves into mechanical<br />
systems, it is required that these systems have a source of energy in order<br />
to be maintained.  Theoretically, aether burners draw their energy from the<br />
other dimensions into which the aether flows.  There is a huge amount of<br />
energy available if the aether flow itself can be tapped.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aether burners are like paddle wheels placed in the flow or aether as<br />
it flows out of our dimension through the quantum distortions of solid mass.<br />
Higher masses naturally have greater quantum distortions yeilding a larger<br />
aether flow.  While the aether is flowing between dimensions, it leaves low<br />
pressures surrounding the masses involved, and this causes reletive motion<br />
between any two masses which have aether flows associated with them.  In short,<br />
gravity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actual aether cannot be burned.  If it was consumed, the universe<br />
itself would experience a much higher enthropy level than it does.  Eventually,<br />
the universe would collapse inward upon itself as the fabric of aether into<br />
which space is woven would grow steadily smaller.  Observed reality is better<br />
served by the theorem that aether simply oscillates back into N-Space at<br />
points of no mass.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This theory also states that warp systems not be used close to any<br />
inhabited system because there is a maximal velocity to the aether flow of<br />
space and this results in a buildup of gravity in any place where warp systems<br />
regularly operate.  Space takes time to compress and decompress.  Use of warp<br />
systems in open, inter-stellar, space is advised since this space will have<br />
a lower compression and is most likely to decompress between jumps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quantum energy theory states that energy can be extracted from this<br />
system indefinitely so long as the amount extracted in any quantum-moment is<br />
too small to promote a state change.  In short, you can extract as much power<br />
from the field as you like, as long as you don't take so much at any one time<br />
that you deform the field.  This amount of energy, constructively and<br />
destructively, is referred to as a quantum.  Because this energy must be<br />
extracted in a single time period, a moment, the whole unit describing the<br />
quantity and time is called a quantum moment.<br />
&lt;HR&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;H1&gt;<br />
                        The Formula....&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br />
<br />
                        ---------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Calibrating the system for use requires knowing the relationship<br />
between the field and the reletive velocity generated.  Since these tests<br />
have yet to be done to figure the precise amount of energy involved to create<br />
an effect of any measured amount, we will express our calculations based upon<br />
a set of known values which is specific to the configuration involved.  These<br />
are:<br />
<ol>
<li><br />
&lt;LI&gt;) The radius of the resulting event horizon.  All quantum compression<br />
     fields result in the creation of apparent black holes.  The event horizon<br />
     is the exact point in this 'hole' where the excape velocity is C.&lt;/LI&gt;<br />
&lt;LI&gt;)  Our distance from the center of the event.  Center of gravity is an<br />
     important constant in any spacial compression system.  It is the best<br />
     place to measure range from since it is the point at which all the force<br />
     of the event appears to be comming from.&lt;/LI&gt;<br />
&lt;LI&gt;)  Period of exposure.  This one is kind of touchy since we can leave<br />
     this value in the resulting value and have a velocity which is added to<br />
     the reletive velocity of the ship to result in its final velocity much in<br />
     the same way as you'd add windspeed to planet based flight through an<br />
     atmosphere.&lt;/LI&gt;</li>
</ol><i><br />
&lt;Factor 1, radius, is R | Factor 2, distance, is D | Factor 3, time, is T &gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;CENTER&gt; 2CR^2T/D^2 = compressed space.&lt;/CENTER&gt;</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quantum fields fall off by the inverse square law.  Reletive to your<br />
starting point, you move off twice as far and the field is 1/4 as strong.<br />
1/2^2 = 1/4.  (2^2 means 2 squared.  Please accept my apology for not having<br />
a superscript key handy.)  If you move off until you are 3 times as distant,<br />
the field strength is 1/9 since 1/3^2 is 1/9.  This leads to an interesting<br />
observation which will be important in the actual calibration section.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mass builds up in 3 primary dimensions, however, the gravity falls<br />
off in only 2 dimensions.  The effect of gravity, in keeping with the<br />
increased volume creating it, should be a minimum of cubed and it is only<br />
squared.  Gravity appears to act in a strait line between the centers of<br />
gravity, thusly one dimension, and the other dimension is theorized to be<br />
time itself.  Measuring gravity is always in a velocity, thus we need a<br />
distance and a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point, our formula is 1/D^2 .  Half as far from the center of<br />
gravity and the field is 4 times as great.  1/(1/2)^2 = 1/(1/4) = 4/1 = 4 .<br />
Four times as great as what?  We have the answer in our list of reletive<br />
factors.  Four times as great as C.  C/D^2 leaves us with one problem.  This<br />
formula is only valid if D is measured in units of R.  We must free up the<br />
formula a bit by putting R into the equation to enforce the reletive balance<br />
for any system of measurement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
R^2/D^2 .  What we start out needing is (D/R)^2 which expresses D as<br />
how many units of R we are from the center of the event.  This is important<br />
because our formula is only valid if D is measured in lengths of R.  Then we<br />
we go through the conversion:  (D/R)^2=(D/R)(D/R)=D^2/R^2 .  Since this is on<br />
the bottom of the equation, C/(D/R)^2, we have to calculate 1/(D^2/R^2) which<br />
is R^2/D^2.  The formula is now CR^2/D^2 .<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our next constant is T.  What we're after is a matter of distance, and<br />
calculating out the units of this equation, we resolve to a velocity:<br />
(m/s * m^2 / m^2 = m/s)  To get rid of the seconds, we have to multiply 1/s<br />
by s.  S is seconds, thus we need a time value in the equation.  CR^2T/D^2 is<br />
the result.  If we leave out the time constant, we'll have the accelleration<br />
added to some I-fix drives which place a quantum disturbance just ahead of<br />
them and 'fall' faster than light.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The total compression of space really does not end at the center of<br />
gravity, so we end up with a total compression of 2CR^2T/D^2 .  This is the<br />
weakest portion of the formula since, although undenyably real, can the ship<br />
really use this portion of the warp?  Only if the ship crosses the center of<br />
gravity.  There is only one safe way of doing that and it involves placing the<br />
center of the warp field within the ship itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At the center of gravity, D=0.  2CR^2T/0^2 is undefined in common<br />
mathematics.  In higher forms of math, it is possible to prove that 1/0 is not<br />
undefined, but infinity.  This point must be avoided since there is no single<br />
point of N-Space which could contain more than all of N-Space.  By the<br />
geometric definition of dimensions, this point is in another dimension.<br />
&lt;HR&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;H1&gt;<br />
                     Geometric Definition of Dimensions.&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br />
<br />
                        -----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By definition, a point is a unit which occupies no space.  Stack an<br />
infinite number of points, end to end, such that AB+BC=AC and you will have a<br />
line which is 1 unit in length and no units in width.  AB+BC=AC is the sinple<br />
mathematical definition of between.  It means that, the distance from A to B<br />
along a strait line, plus the distance from B to C along a strait line, is the<br />
same as the distance between A and C.  Every point in this line is required to<br />
be between the point where you start and the point where you end up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your line segment has no width.  Stace enough of them side by side<br />
with each line being between your first line and your last line, and you will<br />
have a single plane with a width of 1 unit.  Again, this simply requires an<br />
infinite number of lines and an extended definition of between.  It does not<br />
matter what unit of measurement you end up with, the concept is the same.<br />
Zero times infinity is 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I can hear many of your thoughts stating &quot;zero times any NUMBER is 0.&quot;<br />
To this I respond, &quot;what number?&quot;  Both zero and inifinity are concepts, not<br />
numbers.  Zero is a place holder and takes the place of a number which has no<br />
value.  Infinity is, by extension, also a place holder.  Rather than having no<br />
value, infinity has ALL value.  These concepts are opposites.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stacking an infinite number of planes will give you a single unit of<br />
height.  The width of a true plane is infinite, as is the length of a true<br />
line.  We have now come up to 3 dimensions and a fourth remains.  It remains<br />
to be seen if N-Space is bounded or infinite in any single dimension, however<br />
theory leans toward N-Space being limited in all 4 dimensional planes which it<br />
crosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
An infinite stack of 3-D spaces will give you a single unit of<br />
duration.  Q-Techs, such as myself, often refer to any single 3-D space as a<br />
moment.  It is like a frame of film holding an infinitely small portion of<br />
time in a static representation.  A moment lasts for no period of time and is<br />
a basic concept of physics.  4-D N-Space is dynamic and physical computation<br />
will be error prone because of imperfections in the way moments project across<br />
seconds, like the smearing of moving objects in any single frame of film.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If we extend this, we end up with an infinite amount of time-space<br />
becomming a single unit of 5-D space.  Our entire known reality is just a<br />
single point at this higher level.  From this point, it would be possible to<br />
enter anywhere in our time-space.  However, our N-Space is so small that it<br />
would be lost if you move at all in this higher plane.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Star-Navigators are an odd breed of men in that they're born with the<br />
gift of being able to actualize across this vortex at perihelion.  I will not<br />
get into these mechanics as it is beyond the scope of this paper, yet, it is<br />
a fasinating application of Quantum principle and mechanical capacity.  Unless<br />
you have a star-navigator and the photon echo array he needs, do not cross<br />
this central vortex of the warp field.<br />

                        Pionizer Configuration &lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br />
<br />
                        ----------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A standard, class 1, field frame is generated from an array of nine<br />
pionization elements arranged in 3 pionization cores.  The pionization cores<br />
are equadistant around the ship's hull, forming an equalateral triangle. Class<br />
1 is primarily for small craft so this small assembly is sufficient as it is<br />
adequate also for our discussion.  Three pionization cores, given enough power<br />
could handle a body of any size.  Configuration is the key.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Each core is made up of 3 pionization elements fashioned into a cone<br />
with the top cut off.  The area between the points at the top of the cone is<br />
for the bottled quantum disturbance.  In essence, the body of the warp capable<br />
structure is ringed with three contained 'black holes' at specific points<br />
along its hull.  These cores are usually positioned just ahead of the center<br />
of the ship along a horizontle axis, with the cores facing forward in the<br />
same verticle plane.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To use the drive, it must be calibrated at this point.  The angle of<br />
the pionization cores must be adequate for the three quantum disturbances to<br />
combine ahead of the ship without passing through any part of the ship.  If<br />
the fields intersect the body of the ship, structural instability will result.<br />
Tune the freequency injectors of each pionization element so that the quantum<br />
disturbance generated by each core will move along the skin of your ship at<br />
a distance no less than 1 diameter from impacting with any part of the ship.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The minimal angle at which the 3 cores can combine quamtum fields as<br />
close the the nose of the ship as possible without hitting the skin, is called<br />
the ship's critical angle.  Do not exceed this angle.  Conversely, the power<br />
limits state that the quantum disturbances can only remain bottled up to a<br />
given distance from the pionization cores, the main reason that the cores are<br />
forward of the ship's center, and this is referred to as the range angle.  As<br />
the term implies, this sets the ship's warp range by setting the maximum<br />
compression the ship can handle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point, the field looks like a cone.  It originates from 3<br />
points and extends until the three field beams combine into a single field<br />
just ahead of the ship's nose.  From this vortex, where the three quantum<br />
disturbance fields combine, a single compression chanel forms directly forward<br />
from the ship's nose.  This is the ship's warp chanel.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To chose a ship's vector, setting a course, you would draw a line from<br />
your ship's center of gravity to the destination point in space.  Then, you<br />
steer the beams generated when each core extends it's quantum disturbance<br />
until the beams intersect at a point on that line as close to the ship's nose<br />
as possible.  All three beams must be balanced so that no single field is<br />
clearely stronger than any other.  When the beams combine, the entire front<br />
of the ship will become a singular field-frame and be pulled into the warp<br />
chanel.  Your trip begins when the quantum-moment of the fields first reaches<br />
the inertia of your vessel.<br />
<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Wow! I couldn't even finish reading all of this because I keep forgetting the errors I found in the previous paragraph before it. I'm not one to criticize anyone. I earnestly want to find ways of travelling faster than light and time traveling which is why I've pursued becoming a physicist, but we have to keep our facts right or the physicists will be right in criticizing us as being &quot;pseudo-scientists&quot;. First, element 117 is not a member of carbon's family of elements. It's actually a halogen in the family of gases beginning with fluorine, chlorine, bromine (which is liquid at room temperature), etc. and would probably be pretty unstable. The &quot;island of stability&quot; that nuclear chemists talk about is situated around element 115 and can be calculated using quantum mechanics (different from quantum field theory) because of &quot;filled shells&quot; that result inside the nucleus of element 115. Element 118 would also have various degrees of stability in that it falls in the family of noble gases whom have filled electron shells. Being that element 117 is one away from 118, it would be extremely reactive chemically (but this is assuming its radioactivity isn't to bad so that it lives long enough to react chemically). It's electronegativity is high but not as much as the other members of its family.<br />
Second, many of the points in the article are vague, irrelevant, or putting the cart before the horse. For example, what is an acceleration wave? (Is this the same as a gravitational wave?) How do you increase the speed of sound through a medium? Isn't this the result of increasing the density of a medium? Here we have effect preceding cause. What is the gravitostrong force? If this is a combination of gravity and strong nuclear interactions, it can't exist without having the electroweak in it also meaning it would be the superforce described by physicists at the Big Bang. This is something built into the structure of this universe and therefore can't be manipulated. Not saying that in another universe it isn't possible. Sorry, this is mother nature's rules, not mine. How do we know an acceleration wave is a compressional wave? It more than likely is a transverse wave like electromagnetism. Even though gravity classically requires matter to generate it, we know by new theories that gravitational waves can be produced that travel outside of any matter and their only medium is space-time itself. I believe strongly that the relationship between gravity and inertia is the same as the the relationship between electric and magnetic interactions. Gravity and electric are static whereas inertia and magnetism are their dynamic counterparts. Motion generates the second forces from the first forces. Electric forces are mirror images of gravity and when we understand gravity we will have counterparts to Maxwell's equations to describe gravity and inertia's relationships. In fact, these equations will look like Maxwell's but inverted somehow. This is all part of the TOE (Theory of Everything) wanted by physicists. I've forgotten many of the other problems I ran into reading this article, but did anyone else feel the same? I've also found the best way to visualize higher dimensions is the number of distinct lines you can place at right angles to eah other. Imagine two lines perpendicular (at right angles) to each other; Next, place a third line so that it's perpendicular to both of the two lines; this is three dimensions. Finally, place a fourth line so that it's perpendicular to all three previous lines. Can't do it? That's because that would describe four dimensions, a concept almost impossible in three dimensional space that describes our world. Go ahead and try though! I can almost see it...<br />
I apologize if I offend anyone, I'm just rtying to keep things as real as possible <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /></div>

I have yet to recieve a critique from even those who work with me at my normal job who hae little or no knowlege on the subject that has not been benificial. As a matter of fact with each critique that I stumble on to whole new revelations and a more complete understanding of my own theory. And that is without fail. Your expression and oppinions are more valuable to me then all the money in the world to conduct research. Your minds are the best super computer out their becuase God is it's designer. <br />

Thank you for the response, as Gary Edwin Schasteen mentioned, I also agree with his response &quot;Likewise&quot; opposition is our greatest allie to find a link between improper observation of the the inner workings of the cosmos, and misaligned calculations to discover what is really making it tic-toc. &lt;pun intended&gt;<br />
<br />
Different mechanisims call for different applied math &amp; physics, even some that our current command of mathmatical language &amp; phusics are merley on the forefront of understanding. Some of our concepts are still in proces of &quot;Re-configuration&quot; an what this translates to is that we are examining ways to decipher some of the mathmatical language of our ancient ancestors once commanded, and combining that information to be applied to our current understanding of applied modern physics &amp; mathmatical language of today.<br />
<br />
There is so much that we have come to know, yet vey little we have yet to understand. <br />
<br />
Your ideas of a &quot;Linear&quot; since of applied phsics &amp; mathmatical language perhaps does not apply to the before-mentioned propulsion theory, however it does not necessarily negate it's potentiality to work, using quantum mechanics as you mentioned, but quantum mechanichs operates in a &quot;Multidimensional&quot; vortex that whence it is open, it's energy is existing on several planes simutaneously while interconnected, or inter-linked and the space-time continuum is being folded. or &quot;warpped&quot; as in the same applies in an atmosphere (hyperspace) and in the next acceleration, the subject would move alon a spring, or &quot;coil&quot; like hyperdimensional time-line as in what Dr. David Anderson of the &quot;Time-Travel Research Foundation claims as a &quot;CTC&quot; or (Closed Time-Like Curve&quot; (see website.)<br />

Understanding this technology will require an advanced\nunderstanding of reletivity.  In simple, how was the light speed limit\narrived at in the first place?  That is the point as which we, thusly I,\nshould begin.\n\n\n\n        Reletivity is a fascinating concept in that it states that objective\nobservation is really subjective.  For example, from a planet's viewpoint,\nit's star appears to be moving and the world looks stationary.  If we look\nat the same system from the viwpoint as the star, the planet appears to be\nmoving.  From the viewpoint of the galaxy, both will appear to be moving\ncompared to a \"reletively stationary\" galaxy.  And it goes on like this.\n\n\n\nNow we question which of these is the truth.  The only reasonable\nanswer to this question is that all of these observations, and countless\nothers which I have not mentioned, are all true. How can a contradiction be\nthe truth?  Reletively!  Since there is no single universal reference point\nwhich we can all agree upon as absolutely stationary, we cannot discern if\nany of these reference points is truely stationary.  All movement must be\nmeasured reletive to a \"reletively stationary\" reference point since there is\nno objectively stationary reference upon which to base all movement.\n\n\n\nThis being said, we can refer to ourselves as stationary.  If you have\never moved about in a vehicle which moves at a smooth accelleration, then you\nhave felt a phenominon which is the basis for reletivity.  You feel stationary\nand objects you see through the viewports appear to be moving.  Should your\nvehicle drift forward, reletive to the vehicle directly beside you, you may\ntry to stop your forward momentum even if it is the other vehicle, your\nreletively stationary reference point, which is actually drifting backwards.\n\n\n\nAlthough it appears that I'm off course in this dissertation, this is\nan important concept.  With the exception of reference points, designated\nstationary or moving, you have no sensory clue that you are moving.  This\nleads us to question what will happen if you were to have a clue to movement\noutside of the reference point?  Absolute proof of such a thing would topple\nreletivity as we know it.\n\n\n\nNow we come to a point where we have just such an experament.  Without\nthe above assertion, we will not arrive at reletivity.  It is an absolute\nbelief that there is no such sensory proof which will shatter the stationary\nillusion of SMOOTH accelleration which leads to reletivity.\n\n\n\nYou hop into your space ship, and move off to the nearest star.  All\nthe time, you accellerate smoothly to maintain a 1 G environment.  There is a\nmirror above you, perpendicular to the nosecone.  Clearely, the light from\nyour face moves to the mirror at C-(ship's velocity) and bounces back at\nc+(Ship's velocity) .  If you were to keep going for so long that you reached\nthe speed of light, C, then the light moving toward the mirror would be moving\nat C-C or 0 units per second.  Your reflection would vanish.  Suddenly, you\nhave sensory proof that you're moving.\n\n\n\nDon't let the C+C case of the light coming back at you escape notice\neither.  The extancy of the constant C states that light has a fixed velocity\nthrough any medium, including the air of your ship.  As a result, light will\nalways return from the mirror at C units per second.  Base a clock on this\nstructure and something amazing will happen.\n\n\n\nAssume that the clock is so large that a beam of light bouncing from\nthe mirror would take 1 second to return.  That leads us to the equation that\nthe distance to the mirror, D, is C\/2 units.  The total speed of the light\nbeam is C-V(Ship's velocity =V) for the outgoing leg and C for the incomming\nleg. ( C-V+C = 2C-V units per second)\n\n\n\nAt this point, we are using SPOTS <Simultaneous Pulse Optical[BR>Transmision System ] transponders, which can send and receive photon pulses\nfrom the same element.  It is important to note that this is isolinear in that\nthe pulse moves directly forward in the exact direction that the ship is\nmoving and moves directly back over the same path.  When the ship's velocity\nis C, then the photon pulses will move toward the mirror at the same speed as\nthe mirror will be moving away from the SPOTS transponder.  The result is that\ntime stops.  Up until this point, the return leg of the voyage taken by the\nphoton pulse shortens by the same distance as the departing leg lengthens from\nthe movement of the ship.\n\n\n\nEven though all the points for a single, strait line, we have a\ntriangle.  Now we do the experiment in the old way, where the sender and\nreceiver elements of the photon pulse are side by side.  Now the photon pulse\nhas to move across the ship as well as moving from front to back along the\nship.  Something interesting happens.  The beam is moving toward the receiver\nthroughout it's entire flight, thus, if the flight to the mirror is lengthened\nby the movement of the ship, this pulse hits the mirror off center.  If the\nmirror is not wide enough to reach between the centers of both the sender and\nreceiver, then there is a speed at which the beam would miss the mirror.\n\n\n\nThis leads to an odd perception in which you, unaware that there is\nany reletive momentum, see space warping in the mirror.  Suddenly, you can\nsee further to one side of the room, beside you, than you could.  It's a slow\nprocess, depending on the velocity increase during this time, however, you\ncould eventually see the side of objects which face the mirror. Note, that any\nchange in reletive velocity voids the guarantee of reletivity.  Acceleration,\nas used in this paper, refers to the movement of the bodies involved and not\nto a change in velocity.\n\n\n\nAnd now we get to the transverse experiment.  The mirror is now\nmounted on the port side, with the sender and receivers mounted at opposite\nends of the Starboard wall.  The receiver is at the front of the ship and the\nsender is at the tail.  Now, viewed from outside, the photon pulse has to\ncatch up with the mirror, and then catch up with the receiver.  If we were to\ncompute the distance as viewed from outside the ship, it would be much further\nfrom the sender to the receiver, off the mirror, than it is from the inside of\nthe ship.  Time is slowed. Interestingly, the opposite will happen if the beam\nwas to be fired the other way, from front to back.  Time speeds up moving in\nthat direction.\n\n\n\nThis stretching of time is spacial reletivity.  If we were to compute\nthe triangle formed by the sender, mirror and receiver, it would be possible\nto arrive at the remarkable E=MC^2 as the amount of energy contained in 'dead\nmass,' but that is not our current concern, so we'll skip the exercise.  Yet,\nit is important to note that this formula expresses only the energy in the\nmass and not the energies which can be stored in it.  Heat, kenetic and the\nlike are added to this.  That is important because the increase in kenetic\nenergy as we approach C adds to the apparent mass of the body and is part of\nwhy we cannot exceed C within Normal N-Space <time-space>.\n\n\n\nThe slowing down of time and the reletive increase in mass are the\nreal reasons that FTL <Faster than Light> drive is considered impossible.  It\nis important that you know these effects, however, it is not important that\nwe discuss them at length because they must NOT apply in the processes\noutlined in this paper or FTL drive, all of warp technology, will be\ninvalidated.\n<HR>\n<H1><CENTER>           Starting Point.. <\/CENTER><\/H1><HR>\n\n                        ----------------\n\n\n\nNotice another odd effect.  All falling bodies are conducted through\nspace at the same velocity under a gravitational accelleration.  Weight, and\nmass, seem to have no effect on gravitational accelleration.  This simple\nobservation is the beginning of inertial bias, field accelleration and full\nblown spacial warping.  Although inertia is added to these bodies while they\nare in reletive free-fall, there is no difference in the way that the field\nof gravity reacts as a result of this increase.  In fact, the increase in\nmass which results from high velocity momentum actually adds strength to the\ngravitic field it generates.\n<HR><CENTER><H1>\n              Reducing Inertia to a Speed.<\/H1><\/CENTER><HR>\n\n              ----------------------------\n\n\n\nMatter is comprised of many small components which act as larger\nsingular structures.  The exact nature of these components is purely\ntheoretical, although it is known that such structures contain energy\ncontained within quantum fields.  This of genesit particles, particles on the\nboundry between matter and energy such as photons, as bubbles of quantum\nforces which are full of pure energy.\n\n\n\nIf you wish to accellerate such constructions, you will notice that\nthe whole structure will deform as the intertial forces along some connections\npropogate.  Inertia itself is an expression of this deformation in the way\nthat the attempt to accelerate the body in one inertial state must move\nthrough the body and reach each component of the body in order for it to reach\na stable rate of movement.  Clearely, the speed of inertia is the speed of\nsound through the medium in question.\n\n\n\nSince the force which is applied to change the inertial state of a\nbody is applied to a small portion of the body, the components of the body\nadjacent to that point will be moving reletively faster than the remaining\nportions of the body.  Contraction along the body will result in something\ncalled inertial compression which can cause stress failures in the mechanical\nand structural systems of the body in question.\n\n\n\nSound, like accelleration, is a compressional wave, thusly, the speed\nof sound increases proportionally to the density of the medium.  This velocity\nis not a matter of the compressability of the medium as virtually\nincompressable materials, the basis of hydrolic systems, experience the same\nincrease in the speed of sound reletive to density.  Such compression is,\nrather, the ability of the medium to conduct isolinear momentum without\nexcessive dispersion.\n\n\n\nAn increase in the speed of sound through a body does not result in\nthe loss of inertia.  Conversely, it results in the increase in inertia since\nthe entire body must be moved by the applied force, at the moment of inertia,\nrather than the applied force simply changing the inertial state of small\nparts of the body in any moment until the whole body is in its new, steady,\ninertial state.  This can be conveniently expressed as F=MA where force is the\nmass of the body times the acceleration.\n\n\n\nF\/A=M therefore, the higher the inertial conduction (acceleration),\nthe lower the mass which can be accelerated by it.  This action is also time\ndependant, posessing the property of quantum energy.  Quantum energy requires\nthat the whole quantum of energy required to change a state must be applied\nin one instant or it will have no effect on the system.  There is never a\n'residual' in quantum energy.  None of the 'excess' energy from one moment is\navailable to change the state of the body in the next moment.\n<HR><CENTER><H1>\n                        Field Accelleration<\/H1><\/CENTER><HR>\n\n                        -------------------\n\n\n\nNow we reach the first principle of warp technology.  The main reason\nwe exceed the light speed limit is inertia.  As a body approaches the light\nspeed limit, C, it's mass will increase exponentially up to infinity at C.\nOur second problem is the 'time slip' which states that time must stand still\nto a body moving at C or the principle of reletivity will be violated.  I'll\nget to the second problem later.\n\n\n\nField accelleration refers to the accelleration of the body by\napplying the momentum to the components which make up the body rather than to\nthe body itself.  The difference may seem small, however, it is profound.  In\nolder forms of propulsion, force is applied from the power plants and is\nsubject to inertia as it propogates through the body to change its inertial\nstate.  With a field accelerator, the body is emersed in the field and biased\nto a certain inertial state.  There is no inertial effect since the force does\nnot have to propogate across the body.\n\n\n\nAny quantum force of sufficient capacity can produce a warp field.\nGravitation is the most often expressed force, however, electormagnetism is\nthe most used force since it is the most controllable and understood.  It is\nalso important to note that electroweak force, of which electromagnetic force\nis a subset, is kenetic whereas gravitostrong force is static.  Static forces\nare difficult to bias and often require an actual imbalance in the field to\nachieve the warp effect.  Kenetic forces have a polarity and can easily be\nbiased in their natural flows without applying undue stress to the structure\nof the body involved.\n\n\n\nHandling the 'time slip' problem is the most complex part of the\nsystem.  Although the field is external to the body and does not experience\nthe distortion of time in itself, the body contained within the field have to\ncope with displacement as movement across vast distances in space result in\nmovement through equally vast amounts of time.  This is an unacceptable\nconsequince of warp travel.\n\n\n\nField acceleration handles this as well.  The body within the field\nexperiences no inertia and is therefore in a state of stable inertia all the\ntime.  Such bodies are moving at sublight velocities sufficiently small as not\nto experience time slip.  It is the surrounding space which is warped by the\nallererator field.  Quantum accleration of the entire field frame compresses\nspace in an isolinear fassion.  \n<HR><CENTER><H1>\n                        Time Dilation<\/H1><\/CENTER><HR>\n\n                        -------------\n\n\n\nTwo types of time disruption occur in faster than light (FTL) space\nflight; virtual and actual.  Actual time dilation is the difference between\nthe reletive 'speed' of time within the warp field and time measured outside\nthe field.  Virtual time displacement is the apparent change in time resulting\nfrom moving into space over distances so vast that your point of departure\nappears to move backward in time and your destination seems to move forward in\ntime by an equally great distance.\n\n\n\nVirtual time displacement is the one which cannot be solved at present\nand the simpler of the two to describe, so I'll start there.  Since light\nmoves at a constant velocity, moving faster than light will require light\nwhich leaves your point of origin at the present time to have to catch up with\nyou.  That means that you could see yourself leaving port by stopping at the\nright point and using a powerfull enough theoretical telescope. If your\ndeparture was broadcast to your destination, about a light week into space,\nyou could watch yourself leave your point of origin almost week after you\narrived at your destination!\n\n\n\nSince higher life is also social life, this displacement has a real\neffect on the mental state of star age (Ketueen) races.  When you arrive at\nyour destination, only hours after you leave port, a week would appear to have\npassed even though you did not really slip through time.  The real\ndisplacement is that your only contact between these points will have been\nlimited to light speed limited communications.  This means less in the age of\nsubspace radio, however, radio doesn't correct for your vision.\n\n\n\nYou see your point of origin moving back in time as you leave and your\ndestination moving forward as you approach it.  At one time, this form of\nisolation posed a mental health threat to colonists.  They would sometimes\nlook out into space and see a time before their home star was created.  Radio\nwasn't fast enough to counter this effect.\n\n\n\nActual time disruption results in the dilation of time within the\ncabin of your ship as a result of it's forward momentum.  We reduce this by\ncompressing space along isolinear chanels between navigational points so that\nwe can move through space at sublight speeds while covering lightyears in\nseconds.  This dilation cannot be completely neutralized because the ship will\nbe moving and ANY velocity results in this effect.  N-Stable drive compensates\nbetter than the I-Fix system, but the dilation is still there.\n<HR><CENTER><H1>\n                      I-Fix Drive systems.<\/H1><\/CENTER><HR>\n\n                      --------------------\n\n\n\nCommon warp drive units are in the I-Fix class since they do not\ninvolve moving through alternate dimensional vortexes.  They are fixed in\nN-space which is the same 4-dimensional time-space within which the ship\noriginated.  These drive units rely on the principles of field accelleration\nto produce short-cuts between navigational points.  This works by producing\nstrong enough quantum fields along an isolinear corridor to produce an\napparent shortening of linear space between two points in N-space.\n\n\n\nThis effect is largely an illusion.  Space itself does not really\nfold.  The quantum field projected to appear just ahead of the body to be\nconducted along the warp chanel really accellerates the body in such a way\nthat no inertia is experienced, thus it appears that space is moving and not\nthe body being conducted along the chanel.  As a result, the body within the\nfield 'tricks' N-space into refreshing the structure of the body at a distance\nfrom where it could actually have been while bounded by the light speed limit.\n\n\n\nI-Fix drive mechanics is a combination between superstring theory and\naether theory.  Aether theory is the older of the two and was thought to have\nbeen disproven long ago, until revived by corrolaries of superstring theory\nand reletivity.  Superstring theory is essential to warp dynamics in that it\nallows the bodies involved to be conducted along the warp chanel as the energy\nthey are made of rather than as completed structures.  If this was not\npossible, the quantum fields required to producte the warp effect would crush\nthe body being conducted along them.  Such bodies must be absorbed into the\nfields during movement.\n\n\n\nAether theory expresses a material, called aether, through which\nmagnetic waves propogate.  Gravity is expressed as the consumption of aether\nby mass, kind of like the 'vacuum' produced near the drain plug of a tub.\nSuperstring theory expands on this to say that the aether is not consumed, but\nthat it oscillates into another dimension to return at another point where\nthere is reletively no mass.\n\n\n\nSuperstring theory is drawn from the fact that all 'solid particles'\nof matter can be diffracted by the 'double slit experament.'  This indicates\nthat subatomic particles are not solid, but standing waves.  That leads to a\nnew view of reality in that nothing is really solid.  Warp theory draws from\nthis to allow for a quantum field to be constructed along a field-frame such\nthat the body within the field is indistinguishable from the field.  At that\npoint, the body cannot be destroyed by the field because there is no\ndifference between the field and the body.\n\n\n\nReletivity also helps here.  Imagine that there are two stars, one on\neach horizon from where you are standing on a planet.  Your planet is orbiting\nits star away from one star and toward the other.  Since the speed of light\nmust be a constant, and you would see it as higher on the star you are moving\ntoward, there must be extra space compressed along the leading edge of your\norbit to account for the additional distance the light from that star has to\ntraverse to stay at a fixed speed.  Likewise, there has to be a stretching of\nspace so that the light from the star you are moving away from does not appear\nto be moving slower than C.\n<HR><CENTER><H1>\n                                N-Stable Systems.<\/H1><\/CENTER><HR>\n\n                                -----------------\n\n\n\nN-Stable drive units rely on the existence of dimensions which run\nalong the same plane as N-Space yet have important differing properties.  For\nexample, hyperspace is a dimension which is essentially empty and has no light\nspeed limit.  These dimensions must run along the same plane as N-Space so\nthat re-entry is possible after the distance required is traversed.  The\nextancy of such planes is not beyond the reach of probability.\n\n\n\nExtra-dimentional travel for short distances requires entry into a\nplane which matches the state of N-Space adequately for the survival of the\npassengers of the vehicle making the journey and a shift in phase which\nproduces an effect which can be mapped onto N-Space as faster than light\nmomentum for a fixed period of time.  The survival aspect of the requirements\nis understandable.  Mapping an effect onto N-Space as a fixed period of FTL\nmovement is a bit more complex, but the entire process wouldn't be worth much\nwithout it.  Why bother using N-Stable drive if you cannot get anywhere you\ncouldn't get just as easily without it?\n\n\n\nHyperspacial travel is a limited subset of wormhole travel.  A tunnel\nis created between two distant points in N-Space and the body travesing that\ndistance jumps into it.  This is a subset of wormhole travel, and not real\nwormhole travel, since a wormhole has no real length.  True wormholes are\ndirect connections between distant points in N-Space which can connect without\nregard for time or spacial distance.\n\n\n\nWormholes are like mirrors running in reverse.  You look at a mirror\nfrom the side and the mirror is an maybe inch thick.  The reflection in the\nmirror is close to two dimensional, and should be two dimensional.  Looking\nat the mirror from the front will yeild a reconstruction of 4 dimensional\nN-Space within the apparent space of the reflection.  There is no true limit\nto the amount of space which can appear in this 2-D matrix.  It will appear as\nlarge as the space being reflected by the mirror, and last as long as the unit\nof space being reflected.\n\n\n\nWith a wormhole, the effect is reversed.  You look into the wormhole\nand see the N-Space at a great, or not so great, distance from your current\nlocation.  It could be across the room or across the universe.  From the side,\nthese locations will be separated by much more distance than they are through\nthe wormhole.  Apparently, the length of the womrhole from the outside is\nmany times as great as the distance within the wormhole.\n\n\n\nMoving through the wormhole requires a reletive dimensional stabalizer.\nAny warp capable ship will be able to use the inertial field accellerator as\na stabalizer and enter the wormhole.  The real problem being that wormholes\nare are dimensionally unstable with a tendancy to collapse across any particle\nof solid matter which enters them.  This effect is due to the quantum folding\nof N-Space which causes solid matter to hold its shape.  Warp fields reduce\nthe body within them into a single field frame which appears to be a\ncollection of genesit particles held suspended across a magnetic matrix.\n\n\n\nHyperspace uses wormholes to move into a paralell dimensional space\nwhich can be reletively smaller than N-Space or where the light speed limit\ndoes not exist.  Since these dimensions overlap N-Space at every point,\nmovement along these planes will allow you to re-enter N-Space through another\ngenerated wormhole at a distance so great that light could not cover the same\ndistance in the same time frame.  The case where space is reletively smaller\nis the most like standard I-Fix drive, but it is not the only application of\ncompressed space.  It is possible that the dimensions on the space you jump to\ncan be twisted in such a way that your ports are directly adjacent.\n\n\n\nPerihelion is the most extreme case of spacial compression.  In this\ncase, only a single point covers all of N-Space.  From perihelion, you can\nreturn to N-Space at any point in space-time without limits.  This is the\ndomain of a special breed of FLT drive called star-navigation.  Bodies moving\nthrough perihelion using star-navigation are de-actualized for entry and then\nre-actualized by the star-navigator at their destinations.\n\n\n\nSpaces where the light speed limit does not exist also has an extreme\ncase.  It is possible that additional planes which overlap N-Space use the\nsame time-space, however, they use it in differing orders.  For example, time\nspent in one of these dimensions maps back to distance traveled at light\nspeed.  This is not all that impressive unless you realize that lateral\nmovement maps back to time in N-Space, thusly the body can return to N-Space\nbefore it left.  Since velocity is a matter of distance and time, the light\nspeed limit technically does not exist in these dimensions.\n<HR><CENTER><H1>\n                        Methodologies.<\/H1><\/CENTER><HR>\n\n                        --------------\n\n\n\nNow that the cold theory is basically finished, or as far as I intend\nto go for now, we can get into reducing the cold theory to practice.  This is\nthe exciting part even though it is really just a matter of math and\ndemonstrations of the concepts expressed to this point.  You are still years\nfrom reducing the hard science expressed here to your own working drive units\neven if you understand everything in the remainder of this thesis.  That's why\nyou spend years in the academy....\n\n\n<U>\nRGFC:<\/U>\n\n-----\n\n\n\nLong ago, the military was looking for a way to evade missile radar\non ships.  The experamanet was called the \"Philidelphia Project.\"  It worked\nby using a huge military degauser which cloaked the ship in question within a\nhuge magnetic field.  This ship was not onle radar invisible, but actually\nvanished, to reappear many miles from its starting point.  Thusly began the\napplication of spacial warp technology.\n\n\n\nA book was written in an attempt to explain why this happened, and the\nentertainment industry built a story around it so that most people didn't even\nknow that there was a factual basis to the whole thing.  This was an excellent\ncover for the dissemination of information and for keeping the general public\nfrom knowing what was really going on.  All the truth was generally available\nand nobody who was uninitiated cared to look.\n\n\n\nFrom there, an experament began circulating through the underground\nbased on the infamous millitary project.  The file containing this experament\nis called \"RGFC\" for 'Reletive Gravity Field Control.'  <Title breakdown is[BR>unconfirmed as of this writing.]  This experament can be very hazardous if you\nare not fully prepared for the incredible heat it will generate, so extreeme\ncaution should be used if you decide to go through with it.  You will be\nworking with 50 Kev DC power systems flowing through coils and that is very\nhazardous.\n\n\n\nRGFC starts with a thermoplastic tube about two feet long and 8 inches\nin diameter.  A field coil is wound around this tube, and a second coil of\nequal capacity is placed within the tube.  This tube is sealed, with care to\nbe sure it can handle a great deal of heat and pressure, after flooding with\nglycerin.  The glycerin was the optimal electrolyte for the system when the\nfile was last updated.  Both the internal and the external coils are charged\nto 50 Kev (DC), and then a 25 Kev power supply is split between the coils.\nEach of these three power sources must be independant to avoid crosovers which\nwill drain the effect of this field wave guide.  Connect the negative lead of\nthe 25 Kev (DC) power supply to the negative pole of the central coil's power\nand the positive pole to the positive pole of the outer coil's feed.\n\n\n\nThe original design called for a third coil to run through the exact\ncenter of the whole thing as an antenna to inject frequencies into the\ncomplete apperatus, however this has been replaced by looping a coil around\nthe outside of the completed wave guide.  This newer design makes for better\nfield control.  Structurally, the field guide is two electromagnetic coils\nwith a capacitent field across them.  A central iron bar might amplify the\neffect, however, it will also be subject to the same effect as the cores in\nhigh voltage transformers and deform from the pulses in the huge magnetic\nfield.  Powdered iron would be a better choice.\n\n\n<U>\nPionizer:<\/U>\n\n                        -------------\n\n\n\nBased on this design, I came to the pionization core system.  In\nessence, the pionization core is a more efficient and mineraturized version\nof the wave guide described in RGFC.  Three elements are used, each one acting\nas the wave guide listed above, placed in a cone shape.  Exact specifications\nof the pionization core are too sensitive to be released here, however, I must\ndetail how to use the completed structure.\n\n\n\nEach pionization element has two power leads, and a pointed end.  It\ntakes three elements to form a completed pionization core, mounted about a\ncircle so that the three elements are 120 degrees apart.  (equadistant.)  This\nassembly is tilted so that the pointed ends, close to the center, but not\ntouching, are above the assembly.  Antenna leads are fixed to the blunt end of\neach pionization element.  Three elements is the minimum which can be used to\nsteer a phased array in 3-dimensions, and the angle of the elements adds to\nthe controllability.\n\n\n\nThe power leads of the three elements are tied together under the\ncenteral ring, however, they must not enter the actual field produced.  Two of\nthe elements are tied to the negative supply from the leads on the blunt end,\nwith the third accepting the positive lead.  Keeping the points of the three\nelements close together allows the quantum disturbance to be maintained within\nthe tight magnetic bottle.\n\n<PRE>  \" \/*\\ \"  \" + \/-\\  - \" <\/PRE>\n\n\n<U>\nElement 117 <Neutronium><\/U>\n\n                        ------------------------\n\n\n\nNow we need an intense power supply.  Scientists theorize that the\nelements of the periodic table, which become radioactively unstable at about\ncesium in the periodic table, eventually return to stable elements.  This\nhappens at Neutronium, element 117.  Neutronium is a black metal of massive\ndensity and semiconductive properties in the same class as Carbon, Silicon and\nGermanium.  We know this from its placement on the periodic table.\n\n\n\nHow does this give us power?  Since element 117 is the first stable\nelement in the periodic table, and decrease in the gravitostrong quantum field\nwill result in spontaneous degeneration of neutronium into a mass of matter\nand anti-matter.  This degradation is so fast that the inertia of the\nsurrounding air is great enough to contain all but the magnetic energy\nemissions.  Since this is conducted across the pionization field, we can tap\nthe power easily.\n\n\n\nThere is a missmatch in this form of matter anti-matter reaction which\nyeilds genesit particles.  Positive matter and anti-matter do not have the\nsame mass.  Such an imbalance limits the stable state of the fuel burned in\nthe reactor.  Overburning will result in the build up of genesit particles and\npossible mass residue formation.  Caution must be taken to keep the engines\nburning clean.\n\n\n\nElement 117 is not the only element which can be burned in this way,\nhowever, as it is the densest element easily effected by this process, it will\nresult in the highest energy production.  Heating the fuel increases the total\nenergy production since it produces a corresponding reduction in nuclear\nstability before fuel burn is initiated.  This reaction is bottled by the\nquantum field containment system and thusly is not constrained by the low\npressure requirement of magnetically bottled mass anti-mass reactors.\n<HR><CENTER><H1>\n                        Aether burners.<\/H1><\/CENTER><HR>\n\n                        ---------------\n\n\n\nThe oscillations of quantum mass in the aether is another source of\nquantum energy.  Since aether theory makes atoms themselves into mechanical\nsystems, it is required that these systems have a source of energy in order\nto be maintained.  Theoretically, aether burners draw their energy from the\nother dimensions into which the aether flows.  There is a huge amount of\nenergy available if the aether flow itself can be tapped.\n\n\n\nAether burners are like paddle wheels placed in the flow or aether as\nit flows out of our dimension through the quantum distortions of solid mass.\nHigher masses naturally have greater quantum distortions yeilding a larger\naether flow.  While the aether is flowing between dimensions, it leaves low\npressures surrounding the masses involved, and this causes reletive motion\nbetween any two masses which have aether flows associated with them.  In short,\ngravity.\n\n\n\nActual aether cannot be burned.  If it was consumed, the universe\nitself would experience a much higher enthropy level than it does.  Eventually,\nthe universe would collapse inward upon itself as the fabric of aether into\nwhich space is woven would grow steadily smaller.  Observed reality is better\nserved by the theorem that aether simply oscillates back into N-Space at\npoints of no mass.\n\n\n\nThis theory also states that warp systems not be used close to any\ninhabited system because there is a maximal velocity to the aether flow of\nspace and this results in a buildup of gravity in any place where warp systems\nregularly operate.  Space takes time to compress and decompress.  Use of warp\nsystems in open, inter-stellar, space is advised since this space will have\na lower compression and is most likely to decompress between jumps.\n\n\n\nQuantum energy theory states that energy can be extracted from this\nsystem indefinitely so long as the amount extracted in any quantum-moment is\ntoo small to promote a state change.  In short, you can extract as much power\nfrom the field as you like, as long as you don't take so much at any one time\nthat you deform the field.  This amount of energy, constructively and\ndestructively, is referred to as a quantum.  Because this energy must be\nextracted in a single time period, a moment, the whole unit describing the\nquantity and time is called a quantum moment.\n<HR><CENTER><H1>\n                        The Formula....<\/H1><\/CENTER><HR>\n\n                        ---------------\n\n\n\nCalibrating the system for use requires knowing the relationship\nbetween the field and the reletive velocity generated.  Since these tests\nhave yet to be done to figure the precise amount of energy involved to create\nan effect of any measured amount, we will express our calculations based upon\na set of known values which is specific to the configuration involved.  These\nare:\n\n<LI>) The radius of the resulting event horizon.  All quantum compression\n     fields result in the creation of apparent black holes.  The event horizon\n     is the exact point in this 'hole' where the excape velocity is C.<\/LI>\n<LI>)  Our distance from the center of the event.  Center of gravity is an\n     important constant in any spacial compression system.  It is the best\n     place to measure range from since it is the point at which all the force\n     of the event appears to be comming from.<\/LI>\n<LI>)  Period of exposure.  This one is kind of touchy since we can leave\n     this value in the resulting value and have a velocity which is added to\n     the reletive velocity of the ship to result in its final velocity much in\n     the same way as you'd add windspeed to planet based flight through an\n     atmosphere.<\/LI>\n<Factor 1, radius, is R | Factor 2, distance, is D | Factor 3, time, is T >\n\n<CENTER> 2CR^2T\/D^2 = compressed space.<\/CENTER>\n\n\n\nQuantum fields fall off by the inverse square law.  Reletive to your\nstarting point, you move off twice as far and the field is 1\/4 as strong.\n1\/2^2 = 1\/4.  (2^2 means 2 squared.  Please accept my apology for not having\na superscript key handy.)  If you move off until you are 3 times as distant,\nthe field strength is 1\/9 since 1\/3^2 is 1\/9.  This leads to an interesting\nobservation which will be important in the actual calibration section.\n\n\n\nMass builds up in 3 primary dimensions, however, the gravity falls\noff in only 2 dimensions.  The effect of gravity, in keeping with the\nincreased volume creating it, should be a minimum of cubed and it is only\nsquared.  Gravity appears to act in a strait line between the centers of\ngravity, thusly one dimension, and the other dimension is theorized to be\ntime itself.  Measuring gravity is always in a velocity, thus we need a\ndistance and a time.\n\n\n\nAt this point, our formula is 1\/D^2 .  Half as far from the center of\ngravity and the field is 4 times as great.  1\/(1\/2)^2 = 1\/(1\/4) = 4\/1 = 4 .\nFour times as great as what?  We have the answer in our list of reletive\nfactors.  Four times as great as C.  C\/D^2 leaves us with one problem.  This\nformula is only valid if D is measured in units of R.  We must free up the\nformula a bit by putting R into the equation to enforce the reletive balance\nfor any system of measurement.\n\n\n\nR^2\/D^2 .  What we start out needing is (D\/R)^2 which expresses D as\nhow many units of R we are from the center of the event.  This is important\nbecause our formula is only valid if D is measured in lengths of R.  Then we\nwe go through the conversion:  (D\/R)^2=(D\/R)(D\/R)=D^2\/R^2 .  Since this is on\nthe bottom of the equation, C\/(D\/R)^2, we have to calculate 1\/(D^2\/R^2) which\nis R^2\/D^2.  The formula is now CR^2\/D^2 .\n\n\n\nOur next constant is T.  What we're after is a matter of distance, and\ncalculating out the units of this equation, we resolve to a velocity:\n(m\/s * m^2 \/ m^2 = m\/s)  To get rid of the seconds, we have to multiply 1\/s\nby s.  S is seconds, thus we need a time value in the equation.  CR^2T\/D^2 is\nthe result.  If we leave out the time constant, we'll have the accelleration\nadded to some I-fix drives which place a quantum disturbance just ahead of\nthem and 'fall' faster than light.\n\n\n\nThe total compression of space really does not end at the center of\ngravity, so we end up with a total compression of 2CR^2T\/D^2 .  This is the\nweakest portion of the formula since, although undenyably real, can the ship\nreally use this portion of the warp?  Only if the ship crosses the center of\ngravity.  There is only one safe way of doing that and it involves placing the\ncenter of the warp field within the ship itself.\n\n\n\nAt the center of gravity, D=0.  2CR^2T\/0^2 is undefined in common\nmathematics.  In higher forms of math, it is possible to prove that 1\/0 is not\nundefined, but infinity.  This point must be avoided since there is no single\npoint of N-Space which could contain more than all of N-Space.  By the\ngeometric definition of dimensions, this point is in another dimension.\n<HR><CENTER><H1>\n                     Geometric Definition of Dimensions.<\/H1><\/CENTER><HR>\n\n                        -----------------------------------\n\n\n\nBy definition, a point is a unit which occupies no space.  Stack an\ninfinite number of points, end to end, such that AB+BC=AC and you will have a\nline which is 1 unit in length and no units in width.  AB+BC=AC is the sinple\nmathematical definition of between.  It means that, the distance from A to B\nalong a strait line, plus the distance from B to C along a strait line, is the\nsame as the distance between A and C.  Every point in this line is required to\nbe between the point where you start and the point where you end up.\n\n\n\nYour line segment has no width.  Stace enough of them side by side\nwith each line being between your first line and your last line, and you will\nhave a single plane with a width of 1 unit.  Again, this simply requires an\ninfinite number of lines and an extended definition of between.  It does not\nmatter what unit of measurement you end up with, the concept is the same.\nZero times infinity is 1.\n\n\n\nI can hear many of your thoughts stating \"zero times any NUMBER is 0.\"\nTo this I respond, \"what number?\"  Both zero and inifinity are concepts, not\nnumbers.  Zero is a place holder and takes the place of a number which has no\nvalue.  Infinity is, by extension, also a place holder.  Rather than having no\nvalue, infinity has ALL value.  These concepts are opposites.\n\n\n\nStacking an infinite number of planes will give you a single unit of\nheight.  The width of a true plane is infinite, as is the length of a true\nline.  We have now come up to 3 dimensions and a fourth remains.  It remains\nto be seen if N-Space is bounded or infinite in any single dimension, however\ntheory leans toward N-Space being limited in all 4 dimensional planes which it\ncrosses.\n\n\n\nAn infinite stack of 3-D spaces will give you a single unit of\nduration.  Q-Techs, such as myself, often refer to any single 3-D space as a\nmoment.  It is like a frame of film holding an infinitely small portion of\ntime in a static representation.  A moment lasts for no period of time and is\na basic concept of physics.  4-D N-Space is dynamic and physical computation\nwill be error prone because of imperfections in the way moments project across\nseconds, like the smearing of moving objects in any single frame of film.\n\n\n\nIf we extend this, we end up with an infinite amount of time-space\nbecomming a single unit of 5-D space.  Our entire known reality is just a\nsingle point at this higher level.  From this point, it would be possible to\nenter anywhere in our time-space.  However, our N-Space is so small that it\nwould be lost if you move at all in this higher plane.\n\n\n\nStar-Navigators are an odd breed of men in that they're born with the\ngift of being able to actualize across this vortex at perihelion.  I will not\nget into these mechanics as it is beyond the scope of this paper, yet, it is\na fasinating application of Quantum principle and mechanical capacity.  Unless\nyou have a star-navigator and the photon echo array he needs, do not cross\nthis central vortex of the warp field.\n<HR><CENTER><H1>                        \n                        Pionizer Configuration <\/H1><\/CENTER><HR>\n\n                        ----------------------\n\n\n\nA standard, class 1, field frame is generated from an array of nine\npionization elements arranged in 3 pionization cores.  The pionization cores\nare equadistant around the ship's hull, forming an equalateral triangle. Class\n1 is primarily for small craft so this small assembly is sufficient as it is\nadequate also for our discussion.  Three pionization cores, given enough power\ncould handle a body of any size.  Configuration is the key.\n\n\n\nEach core is made up of 3 pionization elements fashioned into a cone\nwith the top cut off.  The area between the points at the top of the cone is\nfor the bottled quantum disturbance.  In essence, the body of the warp capable\nstructure is ringed with three contained 'black holes' at specific points\nalong its hull.  These cores are usually positioned just ahead of the center\nof the ship along a horizontle axis, with the cores facing forward in the\nsame verticle plane.\n\n\n\nTo use the drive, it must be calibrated at this point.  The angle of\nthe pionization cores must be adequate for the three quantum disturbances to\ncombine ahead of the ship without passing through any part of the ship.  If\nthe fields intersect the body of the ship, structural instability will result.\nTune the freequency injectors of each pionization element so that the quantum\ndisturbance generated by each core will move along the skin of your ship at\na distance no less than 1 diameter from impacting with any part of the ship.\n\n\n\nThe minimal angle at which the 3 cores can combine quamtum fields as\nclose the the nose of the ship as possible without hitting the skin, is called\nthe ship's critical angle.  Do not exceed this angle.  Conversely, the power\nlimits state that the quantum disturbances can only remain bottled up to a\ngiven distance from the pionization cores, the main reason that the cores are\nforward of the ship's center, and this is referred to as the range angle.  As\nthe term implies, this sets the ship's warp range by setting the maximum\ncompression the ship can handle.\n\n\n\nAt this point, the field looks like a cone.  It originates from 3\npoints and extends until the three field beams combine into a single field\njust ahead of the ship's nose.  From this vortex, where the three quantum\ndisturbance fields combine, a single compression chanel forms directly forward\nfrom the ship's nose.  This is the ship's warp chanel.\n\n\n\nTo chose a ship's vector, setting a course, you would draw a line from\nyour ship's center of gravity to the destination point in space.  Then, you\nsteer the beams generated when each core extends it's quantum disturbance\nuntil the beams intersect at a point on that line as close to the ship's nose\nas possible.  All three beams must be balanced so that no single field is\nclearely stronger than any other.  When the beams combine, the entire front\nof the ship will become a singular field-frame and be pulled into the warp\nchanel.  Your trip begins when the quantum-moment of the fields first reaches\nthe inertia of your vessel.\n\n\n\n<CENTER><H3>        Bon Voyage.<\/H3><\/CENTER>\nBack to my home page.\n\nBack to Pariah Magazine.\n\nSend comments here.\n<\/BODY><\/HTML><\/font>",
