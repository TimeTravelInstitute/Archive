      10 Is time travel to the past logically possible? Is it logically possible<br />
      for you to travel back and have a conversation with your former self?<br />
      Could you kill your former self? Could you do anything to anyone, or could<br />
      they do anything to you, which you had not already done or had done to<br />
      you? Would you, or anyone else, in such circumstances, be a free agent?<br />
      Introduction<br />
      Long a favourite topic of science fiction, the notion of time travel is<br />
      one that raises an enormous number of philosophical problems and<br />
      quandaries regarding causation, identity and the nature of time itself.<br />
      While it is fascinating to study these merely as hypotheticals, research<br />
      in the context of relativity has suggested some circumstances under which<br />
      time travel, to the past as well as the future, might be possible.<br />
      Views of time<br />
      Linear<br />
      The traditional view of time has been of something flowing inexorably<br />
      forwards, and in three distinct stages: past, present and future. The past<br />
      is fixed and unchangeable, the future is unwritten and does not exist yet,<br />
      and the present is what we are experiencing now. This picture is still the<br />
      most intuitive and natural way of viewing time. Since the theory of<br />
      relativity has become more widely accepted, time is no longer seen as<br />
      being so unique and separate, but as part of a four-dimensional framework.<br />
      It is still different to the three space dimensions in many important<br />
      aspects, but it can still be altered by factors such as speed and gravity.<br />
      It is relativity that gives a little credibility to the possibility of<br />
      time travel.1<br />
      Many-worlds<br />
      Another view of time that I will mention is the &quot;many-worlds&quot; or parallel<br />
      universe view, in which a time traveller may not actually be visiting<br />
      their own past, but is actually travelling to a universe similar to his or<br />
      her original universe. Although it might be seen as an extreme extension<br />
      of some principles of quantum mechanics, the many-worlds hypothesis is a<br />
      useful way of sidestepping many of the logical and philosophical problems<br />
      of time travel. This is often thought of in terms of an extra dimension of<br />
      time, with different time-lines branching off because of the different<br />
      events in each system.2<br />
      Time travel is not a physical impossibility<br />
      A good simple description of time travel was given by David Lewis3 as<br />
      being when the personal time of the time traveller differs from the global<br />
      and historical time of the rest of the world. Lewis makes the analogy of a<br />
      personal time as a winding mountain railroad and external time as being<br />
      the distance as the crow flies to demonstrate that this does need a second<br />
      time dimension, but can fit in with our more usual picture of space-time<br />
      as a four-dimensional system. The railroad might take a meandering path,<br />
      even crossing over itself, but it is still contained within the same three<br />
      dimensions as a straight line between the railroad's origin and<br />
      destination. So too, a time traveller's personal time might different to<br />
      the global, external time of the rest of the world, but is still contained<br />
      within that global time.<br />
      Possible types of time travel<br />
      Future<br />
      The type of time travel that is easiest to explain is travel into the<br />
      future, which could be accomplished by a spacecraft travelling at<br />
      relativistic speeds4. As the ship gets faster, time dilation slows time on<br />
      board the spacecraft relative to the planet it has left behind. For the<br />
      viewpoint of those remaining on earth, the astronaut has travelled into<br />
      the future. Travel in this manner is not usually thought of as time<br />
      travel, since the astronaut's personal time continues normally, but it<br />
      would have the same effect as a classic time machine (although it would be<br />
      disappointing for the astronaut to learn that there is no reverse gear on<br />
      the time machine). It also differs from the normal description of time<br />
      travel because, since the time traveller cannot return to his or her<br />
      natural time, his or her path does not cross over or duplicate itself.<br />
      The &quot;Twins Paradox&quot; described by travelling at relativistic speeds is not<br />
      one of time travel, but of time dilation and frames of reference. The<br />
      notion of time flowing at different paces is unexpected and difficult, but<br />
      not as counter-intuitive and confusing as the possibilty of travelling<br />
      backwards in time.<br />
      Past<br />
      Like travelling into the future, travelling into the past would also<br />
      require several gross manipulations and incredible engineering feats in<br />
      order to exploit some of the more unusual effects of the theory of general<br />
      relativity. Many physicists are willing to ignore the possibility of time<br />
      travel to the past because it is so unlikely to occur and the energy<br />
      required to complete it render it extremely improbable5.<br />
      A number of schemes have been proposed to travel backwards in time. Some<br />
      involve a time that loops around itself6, others would use a rotating<br />
      black hole7, an accelerated wormhole8 or a cylindrical object so massive<br />
      that time would be bent right around and into the opposite direction9.<br />
      Although all of them differ to time travel as usually suggested in popular<br />
      fiction in that they also involve travel through space, the logical<br />
      complications are much the same.<br />
      Information<br />
      Another type of time travel that might be much more possible, although a<br />
      little less dramatic, would involve tachyons. Tachyons are controversial<br />
      particles that travel faster than light, and, as a consequence of their<br />
      superluminal speed, backwards in time10. An ability to control these would<br />
      lead to the much the same philosophical problems of causation as a person<br />
      actually travelling backwards. While there would be no problems of<br />
      physically meeting oneself in a previous time, it might be possible to<br />
      communicate with oneself with tachyons, or even to use those tachyons to<br />
      cause (or at least attempt to cause) some events in the past.<br />
      Meeting a previous self<br />
      One scenario of backwards time travel that frequently raises concerns is<br />
      that of a time traveller travelling back and meeting themselves at an<br />
      earlier stage in life, often with the intention of giving themselves<br />
      advice in order to improve their lives or avoid a particularly traumatic<br />
      event. The first issue here is of the problem of duplication: is it<br />
      possible to have two &quot;copies&quot; of the same person at the same place and the<br />
      same time, and if so what is the difference, if any between the two<br />
      people? The second is the problem of the inconsistencies between the<br />
      traveller's memory of the past and the events that transpire once he or<br />
      she goes back to the past.<br />
      In David Lewis' description of time travel, the time traveller's world<br />
      line might have discontinuities in relation to the rest of the &quot;normal&quot;<br />
      timeline11, so he has to go to great pains to explain the continuing<br />
      identity of a time traveller as not only having the same physical<br />
      characteristics as the time traveller's previous existencein their<br />
      personal time, but also an element of causal connection. The methods of<br />
      time travel mentioned above involving travel through space as well do not<br />
      have these discontinuites, so personal identity is easier to ascertain.<br />
      Identity<br />
      If a time traveller did travel back to a time that he or she had already<br />
      lived through, would we be able to say that the two people are one and the<br />
      same? There would obviously be some physical differences in age and<br />
      appearance and mental differences in the older time traveller's extra<br />
      memories and experiences, but these differences would not normally lead us<br />
      to make a distinction between a young and old version of an everyday<br />
      non-time-travelling person as being different people. Although time travel<br />
      seems more complicated, there is no reason why a time traveller's personal<br />
      time line could not cross over itself like a mountain railroad crosses<br />
      over itself on a bridge.<br />
      Inconsistency with the past<br />
      The second problem of meeting oneself as one travels back in time is<br />
      really just a simpler version of the grandfather paradox detailed below.<br />
      If the time traveller does meet with him or herself in the past, then it<br />
      follows that the meeting will be a part of his or her own memories and<br />
      past. Unless the two-dimensional time framework is introduced, the time<br />
      traveller must have a memory of being visited by an older version of<br />
      himself in his or her youth. The possibility of a time traveller acting in<br />
      a way that was inconsistent with the known past raises a few interesting<br />
      questions.<br />
      The Grandfather Paradox<br />
      As the most extreme example of changing the past, a hypothetical is often<br />
      envisaged whereby the time traveller visits the past with the intention of<br />
      killing his or her own grandfather or grandmother so that the time<br />
      traveller will never be born. This is usually known as the Grandfather<br />
      Paradox12. Numerous variations on the theme exist, but the basic question<br />
      remains the same: if time travel to the past were possible, would it be<br />
      possible to change the past, and moreover to change it in such a way as to<br />
      make the time traveller's existence impossible?<br />
      The simplest way to avoid this paradox is by invoking the many-universes<br />
      theory of time. In this case, the time traveller actually kills the person<br />
      corresponding to his ancestor in a different time, leaving his own<br />
      ancestor (and thus himself) untouched13.<br />
      To many, the two-dimensional-time solution is a cop-out, since the time<br />
      traveller is not visiting his or her own past, just a past that is<br />
      remarkably similar to it. Even though the time traveller can perform<br />
      actions that are inconsistent with the past as he or she know it, these<br />
      actions will still have to be consistent with the timeline of that<br />
      particular universe.<br />
      Lewis reminds us not to confuse &quot;logically impossible&quot; with physically<br />
      incapable14. If we look at the time traveller as just another occupant of<br />
      that time armed with a gun and all the skill required to kill his target,<br />
      we would not say that it is impossible for him to complete the task.<br />
      However, this ignores the important fact of the time traveller's past. We<br />
      know that the time traveller's grandfather did not die at that stage, so<br />
      the assassin could not have succeed. We can say the same thing of any past<br />
      event: John Hinckley could have killed Ronald Reagan when he shot him in<br />
      1981, but didn't.<br />
      Doing anything else inconsistent with history<br />
      The case of killing your own grandmother or grandfather is a particularly<br />
      interesting one because it involves not only a contradiction with the past<br />
      as the time traveller knows it happens, but also a paradox that shows why<br />
      such an inconsistency is illogical. Although the existence of the time<br />
      traveller's grandfather is of obvious importance to the time traveller, it<br />
      is not significantly different from any other act that is inconsistent<br />
      with the time traveller's past, whether he or she knows about it or not.<br />
      The time traveller's past exists not just for the time traveller, but also<br />
      for everyone else alive in his or her &quot;natural&quot; time. If the time<br />
      traveller killed someone else or gave them the blueprints for an<br />
      invention, the records of the time traveller's natural time would have to<br />
      show events that correspond with the actions of the time traveller in the<br />
      past, regardless of whether the time traveller knew if that was how things<br />
      would pan out or not.<br />
      Free will<br />
      The worrying aspect of looking at time travel in this way is that it<br />
      eliminates free will for the time traveler. Although the time traveller<br />
      believes that he or she is able to kill a particular person, they are<br />
      destined to fail since the events of that time have already been fixed,<br />
      regardless of whether the time traveller knows of them or not.<br />
      We think of the future as being variable and determined by the actions we<br />
      take in the present. The presence of a time traveller in our time would<br />
      shatter this illusion. Our future is the time traveller's past. If he<br />
      cannot change it, then neither can we. Whatever is written in the history<br />
      books of the time traveller is what we in the present will do.<br />
      If the future is fixed as well as the present, we might look at time as<br />
      like a movie film strip. To everyday people, the film moves past the<br />
      projector at a steady rate and we see only the present. We know what has<br />
      already happened in the movie, but can only guess at what will happen<br />
      next. To a time traveller, the movie is unravelled and spread out on the<br />
      floor. The whole of the movie is fixed, regardless of which frame the time<br />
      traveller believes he or she is in. At no stage can anyone alter the<br />
      course of events once the film has been processed and fixed in its nature.<br />
<br />
      In a two-dimensional description of time, there is no paradox in a time<br />
      traveller killing what appears to be their own ancestor, so it at first<br />
      looks as though free will still exists. Although the time traveller might<br />
      seem to be able to do whatever they want, whatever they do will still have<br />
      to be consistent with the events that transpire within the timeline that<br />
      the time traveller now occupies.<br />
      Imagine two unrelated time travellers both travelling to the same<br />
      timeline: one is travelling to his or her own past (Traveller-A) and the<br />
      other to a time-line that is merely similar to his or her own past<br />
      (Traveller-B). Traveller-A will be in exactly the same situation as if he<br />
      or she were in a one-dimensional time situation, and will be unable to do<br />
      anything inconsistent with his or her own past. Similarly, Traveller-B<br />
      will also be unable to do anything that would be inconsistent with<br />
      Traveller-A's past. Since the events forward of the time when Traveller-A<br />
      and Traveller-B meet are fixed for that timeline, the situation is no<br />
      different to a one-dimensional time situation.<br />
      Changing the past in fiction<br />
      Depictions of time travel in science fiction commonly allow the<br />
      protagonists to intervene with and interfere with the past, although the<br />
      travellers usually take enormous pains to avoid doing so. Two-dimensional<br />
      depictions of time apart, the most logical of these depictions is in<br />
      stories where the memories and records of the past that the time<br />
      travellers have change to reflect the past: usually instantaneously, but<br />
      sometimes as a flow-on effect of the change. Such a notion is plausible,<br />
      so long as the changes they make do not logically rule out the fact that<br />
      the travellers were able to make these changes. In such a situation, free<br />
      will is preserved in all aspects but those that will make it impossible<br />
      for the travellers to exist at that point in time. Of course, the problem<br />
      with this is in determining what changes would rule out this existence:<br />
      killing your own grandfather is obvious, but what of merely preventing two<br />
      of your distant ancestors from meeting, or preventing the time machine<br />
      from being invented?<br />
      The more usual story depicted in science fiction is one where the<br />
      traveller's past does change, but he or she retains her memory of the past<br />
      as it was. This story is inconsistent from a logical and philosophical<br />
      point of view, but makes for a more interesting and conventionally<br />
      comprehensible narrative.<br />
      Conclusions<br />
      For a time traveller, the distinctions between past, present and future<br />
      disappear, so that the future may be fixed and unchangeable. If this is<br />
      the case, free will is gone too, not only for the time traveller, but also<br />
      for all the other inhabitants of his or her past. This conclusion is so<br />
      extreme that we may be better to reject the notion of time travel and keep<br />
      our precious free will than to accept this consequence of the general<br />
      theory of relativity.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Fascinating that this was posted 15 years ago (???) and no one commented... In fact, the title is catchy and the contents are interesting, but I beg to disagree with it. I don't think that free will is an illusion, but at the same time I do agree that most people don't have free will and just march mechanically in the existence.<br />
<br />
&quot;For a time traveller, the distinctions between past, present and future<br />
disappear, so that the future may be fixed and unchangeable. If this is<br />
the case, free will is gone too, not only for the time traveller, but also<br />
for all the other inhabitants of his or her past. &quot;<br />
<br />
When past, present and future disappear it's when we achieve a superior knowledge so that's when we in fact have free will.</div>

Kind of like the Time Machine.  No matter how many times he went back in time to stop her death, all he did was change how she died.  We all have certain things in our lives that are preordained.  How it happens and how we get to the point for it to happen is up to us, but it happens exactly when it is suppose to happen.  Just like death.  You are given a date in which you are going to die.  When that moment arrives, nothing you do will prevent it or stall it.  However, how you died is determined by you.</div>

Is it logically possible\n      for you to travel back and have a conversation with your former self?\n      Could you kill your former self? Could you do anything to anyone, or could\n      they do anything to you, which you had not already done or had done to\n      you? Would you, or anyone else, in such circumstances, be a free agent?\n      Introduction\n      Long a favourite topic of science fiction, the notion of time travel is\n      one that raises an enormous number of philosophical problems and\n      quandaries regarding causation, identity and the nature of time itself.\n      While it is fascinating to study these merely as hypotheticals, research\n      in the context of relativity has suggested some circumstances under which\n      time travel, to the past as well as the future, might be possible.\n      Views of time\n      Linear\n      The traditional view of time has been of something flowing inexorably\n      forwards, and in three distinct stages: past, present and future. The past\n      is fixed and unchangeable, the future is unwritten and does not exist yet,\n      and the present is what we are experiencing now. This picture is still the\n      most intuitive and natural way of viewing time. Since the theory of\n      relativity has become more widely accepted, time is no longer seen as\n      being so unique and separate, but as part of a four-dimensional framework.\n      It is still different to the three space dimensions in many important\n      aspects, but it can still be altered by factors such as speed and gravity.\n      It is relativity that gives a little credibility to the possibility of\n      time travel.1\n      Many-worlds\n      Another view of time that I will mention is the \"many-worlds\" or parallel\n      universe view, in which a time traveller may not actually be visiting\n      their own past, but is actually travelling to a universe similar to his or\n      her original universe. Although it might be seen as an extreme extension\n      of some principles of quantum mechanics, the many-worlds hypothesis is a\n      useful way of sidestepping many of the logical and philosophical problems\n      of time travel. This is often thought of in terms of an extra dimension of\n      time, with different time-lines branching off because of the different\n      events in each system.2\n      Time travel is not a physical impossibility\n      A good simple description of time travel was given by David Lewis3 as\n      being when the personal time of the time traveller differs from the global\n      and historical time of the rest of the world. Lewis makes the analogy of a\n      personal time as a winding mountain railroad and external time as being\n      the distance as the crow flies to demonstrate that this does need a second\n      time dimension, but can fit in with our more usual picture of space-time\n      as a four-dimensional system. The railroad might take a meandering path,\n      even crossing over itself, but it is still contained within the same three\n      dimensions as a straight line between the railroad's origin and\n      destination. So too, a time traveller's personal time might different to\n      the global, external time of the rest of the world, but is still contained\n      within that global time.\n      Possible types of time travel\n      Future\n      The type of time travel that is easiest to explain is travel into the\n      future, which could be accomplished by a spacecraft travelling at\n      relativistic speeds4. As the ship gets faster, time dilation slows time on\n      board the spacecraft relative to the planet it has left behind. For the\n      viewpoint of those remaining on earth, the astronaut has travelled into\n      the future. Travel in this manner is not usually thought of as time\n      travel, since the astronaut's personal time continues normally, but it\n      would have the same effect as a classic time machine (although it would be\n      disappointing for the astronaut to learn that there is no reverse gear on\n      the time machine). It also differs from the normal description of time\n      travel because, since the time traveller cannot return to his or her\n      natural time, his or her path does not cross over or duplicate itself.\n      The \"Twins Paradox\" described by travelling at relativistic speeds is not\n      one of time travel, but of time dilation and frames of reference. The\n      notion of time flowing at different paces is unexpected and difficult, but\n      not as counter-intuitive and confusing as the possibilty of travelling\n      backwards in time.\n      Past\n      Like travelling into the future, travelling into the past would also\n      require several gross manipulations and incredible engineering feats in\n      order to exploit some of the more unusual effects of the theory of general\n      relativity. Many physicists are willing to ignore the possibility of time\n      travel to the past because it is so unlikely to occur and the energy\n      required to complete it render it extremely improbable5.\n      A number of schemes have been proposed to travel backwards in time. Some\n      involve a time that loops around itself6, others would use a rotating\n      black hole7, an accelerated wormhole8 or a cylindrical object so massive\n      that time would be bent right around and into the opposite direction9.\n      Although all of them differ to time travel as usually suggested in popular\n      fiction in that they also involve travel through space, the logical\n      complications are much the same.\n      Information\n      Another type of time travel that might be much more possible, although a\n      little less dramatic, would involve tachyons. Tachyons are controversial\n      particles that travel faster than light, and, as a consequence of their\n      superluminal speed, backwards in time10. An ability to control these would\n      lead to the much the same philosophical problems of causation as a person\n      actually travelling backwards. While there would be no problems of\n      physically meeting oneself in a previous time, it might be possible to\n      communicate with oneself with tachyons, or even to use those tachyons to\n      cause (or at least attempt to cause) some events in the past.\n      Meeting a previous self\n      One scenario of backwards time travel that frequently raises concerns is\n      that of a time traveller travelling back and meeting themselves at an\n      earlier stage in life, often with the intention of giving themselves\n      advice in order to improve their lives or avoid a particularly traumatic\n      event. The first issue here is of the problem of duplication: is it\n      possible to have two \"copies\" of the same person at the same place and the\n      same time, and if so what is the difference, if any between the two\n      people? The second is the problem of the inconsistencies between the\n      traveller's memory of the past and the events that transpire once he or\n      she goes back to the past.\n      In David Lewis' description of time travel, the time traveller's world\n      line might have discontinuities in relation to the rest of the \"normal\"\n      timeline11, so he has to go to great pains to explain the continuing\n      identity of a time traveller as not only having the same physical\n      characteristics as the time traveller's previous existencein their\n      personal time, but also an element of causal connection. The methods of\n      time travel mentioned above involving travel through space as well do not\n      have these discontinuites, so personal identity is easier to ascertain.\n      Identity\n      If a time traveller did travel back to a time that he or she had already\n      lived through, would we be able to say that the two people are one and the\n      same? There would obviously be some physical differences in age and\n      appearance and mental differences in the older time traveller's extra\n      memories and experiences, but these differences would not normally lead us\n      to make a distinction between a young and old version of an everyday\n      non-time-travelling person as being different people. Although time travel\n      seems more complicated, there is no reason why a time traveller's personal\n      time line could not cross over itself like a mountain railroad crosses\n      over itself on a bridge.\n      Inconsistency with the past\n      The second problem of meeting oneself as one travels back in time is\n      really just a simpler version of the grandfather paradox detailed below.\n      If the time traveller does meet with him or herself in the past, then it\n      follows that the meeting will be a part of his or her own memories and\n      past. Unless the two-dimensional time framework is introduced, the time\n      traveller must have a memory of being visited by an older version of\n      himself in his or her youth. The possibility of a time traveller acting in\n      a way that was inconsistent with the known past raises a few interesting\n      questions.\n      The Grandfather Paradox\n      As the most extreme example of changing the past, a hypothetical is often\n      envisaged whereby the time traveller visits the past with the intention of\n      killing his or her own grandfather or grandmother so that the time\n      traveller will never be born. This is usually known as the Grandfather\n      Paradox12. Numerous variations on the theme exist, but the basic question\n      remains the same: if time travel to the past were possible, would it be\n      possible to change the past, and moreover to change it in such a way as to\n      make the time traveller's existence impossible?\n      The simplest way to avoid this paradox is by invoking the many-universes\n      theory of time. In this case, the time traveller actually kills the person\n      corresponding to his ancestor in a different time, leaving his own\n      ancestor (and thus himself) untouched13.\n      To many, the two-dimensional-time solution is a cop-out, since the time\n      traveller is not visiting his or her own past, just a past that is\n      remarkably similar to it. Even though the time traveller can perform\n      actions that are inconsistent with the past as he or she know it, these\n      actions will still have to be consistent with the timeline of that\n      particular universe.\n      Lewis reminds us not to confuse \"logically impossible\" with physically\n      incapable14. If we look at the time traveller as just another occupant of\n      that time armed with a gun and all the skill required to kill his target,\n      we would not say that it is impossible for him to complete the task.\n      However, this ignores the important fact of the time traveller's past. We\n      know that the time traveller's grandfather did not die at that stage, so\n      the assassin could not have succeed. We can say the same thing of any past\n      event: John Hinckley could have killed Ronald Reagan when he shot him in\n      1981, but didn't.\n      Doing anything else inconsistent with history\n      The case of killing your own grandmother or grandfather is a particularly\n      interesting one because it involves not only a contradiction with the past\n      as the time traveller knows it happens, but also a paradox that shows why\n      such an inconsistency is illogical. Although the existence of the time\n      traveller's grandfather is of obvious importance to the time traveller, it\n      is not significantly different from any other act that is inconsistent\n      with the time traveller's past, whether he or she knows about it or not.\n      The time traveller's past exists not just for the time traveller, but also\n      for everyone else alive in his or her \"natural\" time. If the time\n      traveller killed someone else or gave them the blueprints for an\n      invention, the records of the time traveller's natural time would have to\n      show events that correspond with the actions of the time traveller in the\n      past, regardless of whether the time traveller knew if that was how things\n      would pan out or not.\n      Free will\n      The worrying aspect of looking at time travel in this way is that it\n      eliminates free will for the time traveler. Although the time traveller\n      believes that he or she is able to kill a particular person, they are\n      destined to fail since the events of that time have already been fixed,\n      regardless of whether the time traveller knows of them or not.\n      We think of the future as being variable and determined by the actions we\n      take in the present. The presence of a time traveller in our time would\n      shatter this illusion. Our future is the time traveller's past. If he\n      cannot change it, then neither can we. Whatever is written in the history\n      books of the time traveller is what we in the present will do.\n      If the future is fixed as well as the present, we might look at time as\n      like a movie film strip. To everyday people, the film moves past the\n      projector at a steady rate and we see only the present. We know what has\n      already happened in the movie, but can only guess at what will happen\n      next. To a time traveller, the movie is unravelled and spread out on the\n      floor. The whole of the movie is fixed, regardless of which frame the time\n      traveller believes he or she is in. At no stage can anyone alter the\n      course of events once the film has been processed and fixed in its nature.\n\n      In a two-dimensional description of time, there is no paradox in a time\n      traveller killing what appears to be their own ancestor, so it at first\n      looks as though free will still exists. Although the time traveller might\n      seem to be able to do whatever they want, whatever they do will still have\n      to be consistent with the events that transpire within the timeline that\n      the time traveller now occupies.\n      Imagine two unrelated time travellers both travelling to the same\n      timeline: one is travelling to his or her own past (Traveller-A) and the\n      other to a time-line that is merely similar to his or her own past\n      (Traveller-B). Traveller-A will be in exactly the same situation as if he\n      or she were in a one-dimensional time situation, and will be unable to do\n      anything inconsistent with his or her own past. Similarly, Traveller-B\n      will also be unable to do anything that would be inconsistent with\n      Traveller-A's past. Since the events forward of the time when Traveller-A\n      and Traveller-B meet are fixed for that timeline, the situation is no\n      different to a one-dimensional time situation.\n      Changing the past in fiction\n      Depictions of time travel in science fiction commonly allow the\n      protagonists to intervene with and interfere with the past, although the\n      travellers usually take enormous pains to avoid doing so. Two-dimensional\n      depictions of time apart, the most logical of these depictions is in\n      stories where the memories and records of the past that the time\n      travellers have change to reflect the past: usually instantaneously, but\n      sometimes as a flow-on effect of the change. Such a notion is plausible,\n      so long as the changes they make do not logically rule out the fact that\n      the travellers were able to make these changes. In such a situation, free\n      will is preserved in all aspects but those that will make it impossible\n      for the travellers to exist at that point in time. Of course, the problem\n      with this is in determining what changes would rule out this existence:\n      killing your own grandfather is obvious, but what of merely preventing two\n      of your distant ancestors from meeting, or preventing the time machine\n      from being invented?\n      The more usual story depicted in science fiction is one where the\n      traveller's past does change, but he or she retains her memory of the past\n      as it was. This story is inconsistent from a logical and philosophical\n      point of view, but makes for a more interesting and conventionally\n      comprehensible narrative.\n      Conclusions\n      For a time traveller, the distinctions between past, present and future\n      disappear, so that the future may be fixed and unchangeable. If this is\n      the case, free will is gone too, not only for the time traveller, but also\n      for all the other inhabitants of his or her past. This conclusion is so\n      extreme that we may be better to reject the notion of time travel and keep\n      our precious free will than to accept this consequence of the general\n      theory of relativity.\n      References\n      Davies, Paul (1995) About Time Penguin Books\n      Horwich, P.
