<br />
I had been attending the Burning Man festival in the Black Rock Desert<br />
for over 14 days. Burning Man is like another planet. It is also the<br />
most comfortable place in the world to trip. There are thousands of<br />
strangers everywhere, and they are all on an insane variety of drugs.<br />
They expect you to be as well.<br />
<br />
I had been using Ketamine nasally every couple hours for over three<br />
weeks, and I'd tripped on mushrooms, LSD, and GHB earlier that week.<br />
I'd also been using benzodiazapines, barbituates and opiates often in<br />
the preceeding week. It had already been a helluva binge, and I felt<br />
that since it was the last night of the festival that i had better do<br />
something to top off the week. At around 9pm I ingested 200mg MDMA HCl<br />
orally, 100mg Ketamine nasally and 75mgs of TMA-2 orally. A half hour<br />
later, just as I was really coming on to the E and the TMA, I headed<br />
out to watch the Man burn.<br />
<br />
It was spectacular, but not overwhelming. The visuals were strong, but<br />
nothing I wasn't used to. As the man fell I drank my dosage of liquid<br />
2-CB. After the Burn, I headed back towards a friend's camp. When I<br />
arrived no one was present, but I took advantage of a mirror and razor<br />
they had laying around. I snorted two more tenths of E and two more<br />
tenths of Ketamine. As I walked back out onto the playa, the 2-CB, E<br />
and K all hit me at once. Suddenly I noticed many spatial dimensions<br />
that I had never experienced before. I decided to sit down, as I<br />
suddenly feared that I may walk off on some spatial tangent, and may<br />
not be able to return to the normal three dimensional world.<br />
<br />
As I sat and hallucinated vividly, I lost all sense of what was<br />
'actually' around me. I soon became conscious that i was in a space<br />
inhabited by some sort of half-mineral, half-vegetable-type creatures<br />
that shared a bizarre collective consciousness. They sort of resembled<br />
a large garden of sandstone carrots connected by jelly-like tentacles.<br />
<br />
As soon as they recognized my presence they tried to communicate with<br />
me. Their form of communication consisted of disjointed telepathic<br />
images and a strange method altering the color hues in the gaseous<br />
atmosphere that filled this bizarre space. I translated their greeting<br />
as meaning something like, 'Ha, ha, ha - we don't see many of your<br />
kind here!' They then went on to try to tell me many things that I<br />
absolutely could not conceive. The only information that got through<br />
to me was that these entities had to somehow use deceased members of<br />
their collective to perpetuate their sleep cycle. Without their dead,<br />
they could not sleep and would soon die. At the time I translated this<br />
as 'We stuff our dead and use them as pillows.'<br />
<br />
Then, as soon as I had departed, I was sitting back on the playa. I<br />
was still hallucinating intensely, but I could make out some semblence<br />
of reality around me. I had no great insights or revelations during<br />
the experience, only a sense of having experienced something utterly<br />
and totally alien. This combo made DMT look like baby asprin. If you<br />
have a hard head for psychedelics and sometime find yourself camping<br />
out in the desert with 23,000 other drug-crazed freaks i definitly<br />
suggest this combo.<br />
<br />
Any other scenario would just not be bizarre enough to accomodate it.<br />
I know, I know ... SkeptiSp00ks'd just write the whole damn thing off<br />
to extended sleep deprivation exacerbated by amphetamine psychosis but<br />
the synchronicities and proofs are far too numerous and wonderous to<br />
ignore.<br />
<br />
It is merely a different frequency / dimensional level / consciousness<br />
level / alternate reality / etc.<br />
<br />
And just as REAL -- if not more so -- than this one. <br />
<br />
All the best; <br />

<br />
First Written in the Language of His Period by the<br />
V.H. Frater Caeruleus, B:.B:., 11° = 0°<br />
Now Revised in the Universal Cipher of the N:.S:.A:.<br />
and Released Unto this Third Density Plane<br />
of Hopelessly Mundane Existence<br />
with Buckets of Love and Light <br />
<br />
It is necessary, my dear friends, to give you a clear idea of the<br />
interior Community of the Blue Brethren (B:.B:.) which is scattered<br />
throughout the Universe, but which is governed by One Truth, united in<br />
One Spirit and filled to overflowing with Love and Light.<br />
<br />
This Community possesses a Sublime Lodge, in which all who thirst for<br />
knowledge shall be filled; as all the Mysteries of the Cosmos are<br />
revealed through her in full measure unto these Holy Children of<br />
Light.<br />
<br />
It is from her that all Truths penetrate into the world; she is the<br />
School of all who search for Wisdom, and it is in this Community alone<br />
that Truth and the explanation of all Mysteries are to be found.<br />
<br />
It is the most hidden of Communities, yet it contains members from<br />
many circles; nor is there any Centre of Thought -- secular or<br />
otherwise -- whose activity is not due to the presence of one of<br />
ourselves.<br />
<br />
From all time there has been an exterior school based on the interior<br />
one, of which it is but the outer expression. From all time,<br />
therefore, there has been a hidden Assembly, a Society of the Elect,<br />
of those who sought for and had capacity for Love and Light.<br />
<br />
All that any external order possesses in symbol, ceremony, or rite is<br />
the letter expressive outwardly of that Spirit of Truth which dwelleth<br />
in the interior Sanctuary.<br />
<br />
The lesser Degrees are but the outer court or portico of this<br />
Sanctuary. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate,<br />
but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not<br />
intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he<br />
shall imagine he understands them.<br />
Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of the<br />
Holy Blue Brethren of the B:.B:. The whole body of the Royal and<br />
Sacerdotal Art was hidden so carefully, centuries since, in the High<br />
Degrees, as that it is even yet impossible to solve many of the<br />
enigmas which they contain.<br />
<br />
It is well enough for the mass of those so-called Brethren, to imagine<br />
that all is contained in the lesser Degrees; and whoso attempts to<br />
undeceive them shall labour in vain, and without any true reward<br />
violate his obligations as an Adept -- for the Hidden Truths are a<br />
veritable Sphinx, buried to the head in the sands heaped round it by<br />
the ages.<br />
<br />
BELIEVE IT OR NOT!<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>RE: Lilly, Ketamine and The Entities From ECCO</b><br />
<br />
John Lilly, Ketamine and The Entities From ECCO<br />
<br />
In the early 70's, John Lilly was introduced to the drug Ketamine by<br />
Dr. Craig Enright in the hopes of alleviating the pain associated with<br />
Lilly's chronic migraine headaches, which he had been suffering like<br />
clockwork â€” every 18 hours â€” for most of his often-adventurous life.<br />
<br />
Lilly, at the time, was at Esalen Institute conducting seminars when<br />
one of these massive migraines hit him. In situations such as these,<br />
Lilly withdrew into privacy, to suffer alone through the many endless<br />
hours of severe discomfort. It was at this time that Enright suggested<br />
to Lilly that he enter into the Esalen isolation tank and receive an<br />
injection of Ketamine, in the prospect that it would in some way cure<br />
him of his affliction. Lilly in the past had tried a similar<br />
experiment with LSD, but it proved unsuccesful, and the terrible<br />
headaches persisted. In the earlier LSD-assisted experiment, Lilly<br />
attempted to reprogram his human bio-computer in such a way as to<br />
eliminate the faulty circuits that were causing him such distress. The<br />
experiment failed, but now once again Lilly the Scientist was<br />
searching for an answer and a cure to his malignant malady.<br />
<br />
As Lilly floated in the isolation tank fluid, Enright injected him<br />
with 35 milligrams of Ketamine (K). Within a few minutes, Lilly could<br />
actually visualize the migraine pain moving out of his skull, to a<br />
point levitated there in apperceived space, Lilly felt no pain<br />
whatsoever for some twenty minutes, until it once again reentered his<br />
head. When Lilly began moaning and groaning in his water-filled<br />
sanctum of pain, Enright injected him with another 70 milligrams. This<br />
time Lilly felt the pain moving farther away, twelve feet this time.<br />
Thirty minutes later the migraine lightning bolt of pain came rushing<br />
back, lodging itself once again into Dr. Lilly's head. Enright<br />
reloaded his syringe and shot the good doctor up with 150 milligrams.<br />
This time when the pain vacated Lilly's head it kept on going and<br />
didn't come back; clear over the horizon, never to be seen again. An<br />
hour later, after the K wore off, Lilly climbed out of the tank, a new<br />
man.<br />
<br />
A month later, when the regularly occuring migraine failed to rear its<br />
aching head, Lilly was amazed. During his psychedelic research of the<br />
early Sixty's, Lilly was one of the early pioneers in charting the<br />
inner landscapes of the human brain with LSD inside his self-developed<br />
isolation tank. Within those dark, still waters of the soul, Lilly<br />
ingested heroic doses of acid and delved deep into his mind to imprint<br />
and re-program his mental circuits toward enlightenment and<br />
self-realization. But where LSD had failed in defeating the migraine<br />
problem, Ketamine had now apparently succeeded.<br />
<br />
A week later when Doctor's Enright and Lilly met at the Esalen<br />
isolation tank, they agreed to join forces and conduct a joint<br />
research into the effects of Ketamine as a possible programming agent.<br />
The movie Altered States was based on one of their initial<br />
experiments. On this memorable occasion, Enright injected himself with<br />
a measured dose of K and â€” with Lilly observing â€” began a strange<br />
odyssey into the primal/archetype regions of his psyche. Unbeknownst<br />
to Dr. Lilly, Enright had reprogrammed himself &quot;to return to the<br />
prehominid origins of man.&quot; Enright, in this programmed &quot;altered<br />
state&quot;, displayed all the typical features, movements and sounds of an<br />
Ape Man; hopping around in a crouching position, grunting, growling,<br />
ranting and howling, gesticulating and shaking frantically his arms.<br />
While all of this high weirdness was going on, Lilly assumed that<br />
Enright was having some sort of seizure. Though in close proximity<br />
with each other throughout the entire experience, the separate<br />
realities they were experiencing were of entirely different natures.<br />
Enright's reality consisted of a confrontation with a leopard, which<br />
he drove away with all his arms flailing, grunting and wild<br />
gesticulations. Finally Enright climbed up into a tree (that Lilly<br />
couldn't see) and stared down at his friend and colleague from the<br />
branches above.<br />
<br />
From this experiment, Enright and Lilly drew three important<br />
conclusions: &quot;First, one's internal reality could differ radically<br />
from the external reality in which one was participating, even with<br />
regard to prominent features of the physical environment. Second, the<br />
person might remain active physically in the external environment, in<br />
a manner not responding closely to one's internal experience of this<br />
activity. And third, one could remain totally oblivious to this<br />
disparity.&quot; Given these conditions, Lilly and Enright agreed that it<br />
would be a good idea at all times to have a &quot;safety man&quot; monitoring<br />
the experiments; to observe the proceedings and insure that those<br />
under K's influence could do no physical harm to themselves and<br />
others. With both men being trained physicians the obvious choice to<br />
fill these roles were themselves, alternately switching positions as<br />
&quot;safety man&quot; and &quot;explorer&quot;.<br />
<br />
One determining factor in Lilly's decision to continue experimenting<br />
with K was its measurability. Unlike other programming agents he had<br />
used in the past, K's effects were extremely predictable, in that you<br />
could determine exacting levels of dosage to correspond with the<br />
desired effect one wished to experience; whereas other mind expansion<br />
agents such as LSD and psilocybin are often more unpredictable in<br />
regards to the facilitation of desired preprogramming. This brings to<br />
mind a possible correlation between Ketamine and DMT, where each of<br />
these drugs â€” administered at certain exacting dosages â€” apparently<br />
summon forth, to the percipient involved, extraterrestrial or<br />
other-dimensional entities. High doses of psilocybin have effected<br />
this response in some users â€” Terrance McKenna, among others â€” who<br />
have communicated telepathically with alien intelligences under the<br />
mushroom's otherworldly aegis. But psilocybin's effects are quirky.<br />
Perhaps this is why the measurability â€” and predictability â€” of K so<br />
appealed to Dr. Lilly. In this manner the scientific method could be<br />
followed to achieve the desired mind-bending results.<br />
<br />
In later experiments, Lilly failed to heed his own advice, becoming so<br />
enraptured in his Ketamine exploration that he would forego the<br />
earlier agreed upon &quot;safety man&quot; and started working &quot;without a net.&quot;<br />
This led to an almost fatal consequence when one sunny day, under the<br />
influence of K, Lilly climbed into his hot tube. When he realized the<br />
temperature was too hot, Lilly futiley attempted to climb out, but in<br />
so doing his muscles lost their strength and he collapsed into<br />
bubbling currents. Lilly was totally conscious at this point, but due<br />
to the effects of K, he was unaware of the external reality of his<br />
drowning body. He was conscious only of his internal world. As fate<br />
would have it, a friend of Lilly's, Phil Halecki â€” who found himself<br />
driven by a sudden sense of urgency â€” decided at this time to phone<br />
Dr. Lilly. Lilly's wife Toni fielded the phone call and, at Halecki's<br />
insistence, went to summon John, only to find him lying face down in<br />
the water, breathless and blue. Fortunately, Toni was able to revive<br />
her husband using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, a technique she had<br />
learned only a few days earlier from an article in The National<br />
Enquirer.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, this close brush with the grim reaper's scythe didn't<br />
deter Lilly from further solo flights flights on K; it only reaffirmed<br />
his deeply held conviction that his life was being watched over by<br />
higher powers of an extraterrestrial origin. Lilly referred to this<br />
network of sublime entities as ECCO, an acronym for &quot;Earth Coincidence<br />
Control Office.&quot; Lilly was positive that all of these fortuitous<br />
coincidences in his life (such as Halecki's life-saving phone call)<br />
had been arranged by higher forces; and that whatever unfortunate<br />
folly fell into his path along the road to knowledge, ECCO would be<br />
there to guide him safely through the tunnel to the light.<br />
<br />
But ECCO was not there only to guide Lilly unfettered through his<br />
mind-bending research; these extraterrestrial benefactors were also<br />
there to test Lilly, to help him overcome his deepest darkest fears<br />
with psychic-shoch therapy. One evening after a kick-ass shot of K,<br />
Lilly sat watching TV when an alien representative of ECCO appeared<br />
and â€” with some advanced form of psychic surgery â€” bloodlessly removed<br />
John's penis, nonchalantly handing it over to him. &quot;They've cut off my<br />
penis,&quot; Dr. Lilly exclaimed. His wife Toni came to the rescue and<br />
pointed out to John that his penis was still intact. Upon closer<br />
examination of his male member, Lilly saw that the ET's had replaced<br />
his normal human penis with a mechanical version that could become<br />
voluntary erect when he wanted it to. An hour later, after the effects<br />
of the K wore off, John Lilly found his normal human penis in place of<br />
the mechanical one, exactly where it had always been.<br />
<br />
Later on, as the frequency of his use on K increased, Dr. Lilly began<br />
having contact with another alien intelligence agency, which he called<br />
(SSI), short for Solid State Intelligence. SSI was a<br />
supercomputer-like entity, much in the same techno-mystical vein as<br />
Philip K. Dick's VALIS. But unlike VALIS, SSI was of a malevolent<br />
nature, at odds with ECCO. SSI's apparent goal was to conquer and<br />
dominate all biological life forms on Earth. To combat SSI, ECCO<br />
enlisted Lilly in this archetypal battle of good against evil,<br />
charging him with the mission of alerting the world at large to these<br />
solid state beings of evil intent. To further confirm the dual<br />
existences of these two opposing alien intelligence networks, Lilly<br />
was given a sign, and message, in the autumn of 1974. Flying into Los<br />
Angeles International Airport (LAX), Dr. Lilly saw the comet Kahoutek<br />
out of the southern sky. Momentarily the comet grew brighter. At this<br />
point a message was laser-beamed into Lilly's mind, which said: &quot;We<br />
are Solid State Intelligence and we are going to demonstrate our power<br />
by shutting down all solid state equipment to LAX.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Lilly shared his foreboding message with his wife Toni, who was<br />
seated next to him. A few minutes later, the pilot instructed the<br />
passengers that they were being diverted to Burbank due to a plane<br />
that had crash-landed near the runway and had knocked down power<br />
lines, causing a power failure at the airport.<br />
<br />
As his haphazard use of K intensified, so did the warnings of imminent<br />
dangers regarding the survival of mankind, provided by ECCO via 3D<br />
Technicolor images beamed into Lilly's mind. These visions were of an<br />
apocalyptic nature; scenes of nuclear annilhilation seen from an<br />
alien's eye view in outer space. The world powers needed to be alerted<br />
of this impending tragedy immediately to enable them to avert<br />
widespread global devastation, ECCO instructed, or it would be too<br />
late. I find it interesting that ECCO's message to Dr. Lilly was much<br />
the same as those delivered to the early saucer contactees: our planet<br />
was on a collision course toward destruction; all atomic weapons must<br />
be dismantled if our planet was ever going to have a chance of<br />
surviving in the future. The only difference was that the enemy was<br />
us, not &quot;them.&quot; Nevertheless, rampant technological progress was to<br />
blame for the sorry state of the planet, regardless if it was being<br />
facilitated by alien intelligences, or humans.<br />
<br />
After three weeks of hourly K injections, Lilly decided that he would<br />
travel to the east coast to warn political leaders and members of the<br />
media of the threat posed by SSI. In New York, he phoned the White<br />
House to warn then President Gerald Ford about &quot;a danger to the human<br />
race involving atomic energy and computers.&quot; A White House aide<br />
fielded the call and, although quite aware, of Dr. Lilly's impressive<br />
credentials, was not convinced of the urgency of the matter, and<br />
informed him that the President was unavailable.<br />
<br />
A young intern who had been assigned to Lilly during this time figured<br />
the good doctor had finally flipped his high intelligent lid and<br />
attempted to have Lilly committed to a psychiatric hospital. Once<br />
again ECCO intervened. Lilly had friends in many high places one of<br />
which was the director of this hospital, who saw to it that his old<br />
friend was released in short order. When the intrepid intern attempted<br />
to commit Lilly to another psychiatric hospital, the same scenario<br />
unfolded, and Lilly was once again released. The young intern could<br />
only shake his frustrated head in disbelief.<br />
<br />
Still following the lead of ECCO, Dr. Lilly continued his<br />
ever-escalating injections of K in order to remain in contact with the<br />
&quot;space brothers&quot;. Soon, though, his sources started to dry up due to<br />
concerns by his connections that Lilly had gone too far of the deep<br />
end. Consequently this led Lilly in search of other long acting<br />
chemicals that would provide him with the same effects as K, but for a<br />
greater duration of time. During the experimental trial of another<br />
drug of similar nature to K, Dr. Lilly received a phone call from his<br />
wife Toni requesting that he bring her spare set of car keys, because<br />
she had locked her others in her car. Since she was simply down the<br />
road a bit, John jumped on his ten-speed and proceeded to peddle down<br />
the road to make the delivery.<br />
<br />
When Dr. Lilly decided to ride his ten-speed bike down the road to<br />
meet his wife, the drug had not yet taken full effect. But midway<br />
through his trip, Lilly was zapped by its intoxicating magic and<br />
instantly felt quite wonderful with the wind blowing deliciously<br />
through his hair; it was as if he'd taken a trip down memory lane to<br />
the days of his free wheeling youth. Unfortunately, this flashbackful<br />
sense of euphoria came screeching to a disastrous halt when the bike<br />
chain suddenly jammed, and he was catapulted onto the harsh reality of<br />
the concrete pavement, puncturing a lung, breaking several ribs, and<br />
suffering cranial contusions. This bicycle crash resulted in several<br />
days of hospitalization, where Dr. Lilly was once again visited by the<br />
otherwordly representatives from ECCO, who told him he had a choice:<br />
He could go away with them &quot;for good&quot; or remain on the planet, mend<br />
his body and concentrate on more wordly affairs. The good doctor<br />
wisely chose the latter. With this decision came a turning point in<br />
his life, and a conscious effort to focus his remaining years not only<br />
on more earthly matters â€” as opposed to the whims and wishes of ECCO â€”<br />
but to dedicate the rest of his life to his wife, Toni, and their soul<br />
mate journey together through physical time and space.<br />
<br />
Many paranormal parallels can be drawn from the experience of John<br />
Lilly, one such being the so-called Near Death Experience (NDE), where<br />
Guides, as he called them (the two representatives from ECCO) appeared<br />
to Lilly much as figurative angels bathed in light do to others who<br />
have experienced NDE. Often, as the seemingly near dead hover before<br />
this subjective light, they are offered a choice much similar to the<br />
one given Dr. Lilly by his otherworldly benefactors from Earth<br />
Coincidence Control Center. Should I stay or should I go?<br />
<br />
Not long after this second brush with death Dr. Lilly's close friend<br />
and Ketamine research partner, Graig Enright, was involved in a head<br />
on collision in the fog on coast Highway One. As Enright lay upon his<br />
death bed, he was visited by Dr. Lilly, who took Enrights hand in his,<br />
and made the following statement: &quot;It's not so bad to die, Craig. I've<br />
been to the brink myself a few times, and I've seen over the edge. The<br />
Beings have told me on several occasions that I was free to go with<br />
them, but I decided to stay here and continue my work in this vehicle<br />
that everyone calls John Lilly; they showed me that I am one of them.<br />
'You are one of us'. I know that you know this because we've been<br />
there together. Whatever you do, Craig, I love you.&quot; On the very next<br />
morning, Dr. Graig Enright shed his mortal coil.<br />
<br />
Thus ends another chapter in Dr. Lilly's often adventurous life. <br />

They sound like Smurfs to me.  Did you get the lesson from this?  The fine doctor finally decided to enjoy THIS life with family and friends.  Where did all the rest get for him but a great big headache to replace the migraines.  Wake up!!  This is killing stuff--not saving stuff.  It is obsessive and self-destructive.  You start feeling like a god and end up feeling anticlimatic--like your life is a great big waste--which it IS.</div>

<br />
When I read Dr. Rick Strassman's &quot;DMT, the Spirit Molecule&quot;, and from what I found out 'personally' as well, -it's on my web-site-,is the following;<br />
<br />
      Under the strongest fourth Intravenous dose of DMT, when breaking through 'time barriers', there was never any recognisable 'gods',,,no Buddha to the Buddhist, no Goddess to the Witches, no jesus to the xians, nothing.<br />
Also the time lines overlap, and parallel worlds become transparent.<br />
<br />
        Was a very generic experience absent of one's diety.<br />
Goes to show that when we see Truth it is far different from what we 'expect' it to be.<br />
<br />
                         Lesson Learned!<br />
<br />
What also is amazing is that various extraterrestrials are usually present when the 'seeker' hits the higher thresholds.<br />
<br />
Now this information is very enlightening. <br />
<br />
Note to the xians:<br />
This is Time Travel forum, not a xian preaching post.<br />
Why don't you losers get lost and stop interrupting discussions.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>RE:  Ayahuasca and the Invisible Hyper-Spatial Insectoid Ally</b><br />
<br />
Dennis and Terence McKenna are two brothers who travelled up the<br />
Amazon in order to investigate the use of ayahuasca by shamans. They<br />
also tried it themselves. The following description of a portion of<br />
their experience, taken from their brilliant book The Invisible<br />
Landscape (Seabury Press, New York, 1975) demonstrates the relevance<br />
of ayahuasca to the subject of UFOs:<br />
We could feel the presence of some invisible hyper-spatial entity, an<br />
ally, which seemed to be observing and sometimes exerting influence on<br />
the situation to keep us moving gently toward an experimental<br />
resolution of the ideas we were generating. Because of the alien<br />
nature of the tryptamine trance, it's seeming accentuation of themes<br />
alien, insectile, and futuristic, and because of previous experiences<br />
with tryptamines in which insectile hallucinatory transformations were<br />
observed, we were led to speculate that the role of the presence was<br />
somehow like that of an anthropologist, come to give humanity the keys<br />
to galactarian citizenship. We discussed this entity in terms of a<br />
giant insect and, through the insect trill of the Amazon jungle at<br />
midday, seemed able to discern a deeper harmonic buzz that somehow<br />
signified the unseen outsider. This sense of the presence of an unseen<br />
alien third entity was sometimes very intense, most intense in early<br />
March, and from there fading off gradually.<br />
<br />
For the next thirty-seven days, especially the next fourteen days, our<br />
shared ideation consisted of, among other themes, but as a dominant<br />
one, the idea of a shamanic journey of return from the ends of space<br />
and time to earth, with the collected energy configuration of<br />
space-time condensed into a kind of lens or saucer, a true<br />
philosopher's stone. One of us experienced an intense transference<br />
state similar to reactive paranoid schizophrenia and accepted the<br />
paternal and curative role of shaman and psychopomp. From the sixth to<br />
the seventeenth of March, one of us did not sleep, and the other,<br />
while awake, spoke continuously, in apparent and convincing telepathic<br />
rapport with anyone he wished, in command of enormous technological<br />
erudition and with a strange and rapidly evolving hyperspatial<br />
cosmology which, following a Manichean perception, visualized the<br />
solar system as a huge light pump, wherein the light of souls is<br />
pumped from planet to planet until it finally leaves the solar system<br />
altogether, and is transmitted to the galactic center. Some of his<br />
&quot;discoveries&quot; were that Jupiter is the reflected image of the earth in<br />
hyperspace, is teeming with bizarre life forms, and is somehow an<br />
essential key to unraveling the species' fate. In his interior epic,<br />
late twentieth century history was experienced as a frantic effort to<br />
build an object, which he called &quot;the lens&quot;, in order to allow life to<br />
escape to Jupiter on the heels of an impending global catastrophe.<br />
<br />
Slowly, as the shamanic voyager neared his home, his place in space,<br />
his stich in time, the mythmaking and the symptoms of election<br />
schizophrenia faded in each of us. However, the continuing process of<br />
understanding, triggered by the experiment, did not cease.&quot;<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>RE:  Martian memetics</b><br />
<br />
eu·gen·ics (yoo-jenn'-iks)<br />
n. (used with a sing. verb)<br />
The study of hereditary improvement of the human race by controlled<br />
selective breeding.<br />
<br />
<br />
For those analysts &quot;in the know&quot; regarding Martian memetics, there's a<br />
theory which has been around for a few years now postulating the<br />
original &quot;Adam &amp; Eve&quot; earth humans hailed geographically from the<br />
continent of Africa, though a cadre of Scientists from down under are<br />
now evidently refuting this popularly accepted notion. &lt;see article<br />
below&gt;<br />
<br />
What they don't know, however, is that aav had it's own Martian<br />
spokesperson (Rich Butler who, BTW, named such notables as Hal Puthoff,<br />
Ingo Swann and various unnamed sources deep in the foul bowels of Ft.<br />
Meade as allies of his) some years back who claimed not only to be a<br />
contactee but also an official mouthpiece for a group of<br />
extraterrestrial babes he called the DoMa (or Daughters of Ma -- see<br />
<a href="http://www.webcom.com/~way/the-way.html" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.webcom.com/~way/the-way.html</a>) who allegedly claimed to be<br />
the Master Genetic Scientists responsible for engineering the bodily<br />
containers which house the souls of our species. His is an odd<br />
Weltanschauung, granted, but there are enough nuggets in the mix to<br />
make the study of his paradigm an exercise perhaps not entirely futile.<br />
<br />
In any event, as his story goes, the grey space aliens (who are, he<br />
claims, merely the subservient android servants of these foxy 'n<br />
powerful ET chicks) concoted the AIDS virus and unleashed it initially<br />
on the continent of Africa to thin out the human herd as they intend to<br />
claim that land mass as their own when they finally arrive en masse.<br />
<br />
How does he know all this? According to him, he was shown both the<br />
entire history and most probable future of our species by these clever<br />
female space aliens via some sort of holography. Admission to the<br />
viewing was free but various concessions such as milk duds, 7up and<br />
popcorn probably cost extra, we can only assume at this point.<br />
<br />
So anyway, I guess if one were to embrace the Butler mythos in terms of<br />
extraterrestrial obssession with the African continent, one could just<br />
as easily assume this was where the initial breeding experiments<br />
transpired in the first place -- despite the apparently blasphemous<br />
heresies now exuding from the Australian diocese of Chapel Scientism.<br />
<br />
There are disturbing aspects to Butler's intelligence briefings which<br />
involve various manifestations of the old nazi racial eugenics<br />
movements and the view that we earth humans are little more than &quot;apes<br />
which speak&quot; who, therefore, must needs bow down in reverential<br />
worshipfulness towards our alleged ET creators and so forth, but in the<br />
final analysis we psense these clever custodians (cf: Bramley's seminal<br />
_Gods of Eden_) to be little more than cloaked Draconian Reptoids up to<br />
their same old tired shenanigans.<br />
<br />
We now leave the reader to decide for himself.<br />

Australia Challenges Out-Of-Africa Evolution Theory<br />
<br />
<br />
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian scientists said on Tuesday they had<br />
analyzed the oldest DNA ever taken from human remains, and that the<br />
results challenge the theory that modern humans evolved from African<br />
ancestors alone.<br />
<br />
Researchers at Australian National University said they had analyzed<br />
DNA taken from remains unearthed in 1974 at Lake Mungo in the state of<br />
New South Wales. Dating in May 1999 put the age of the skeletal remains<br />
at between 56,000 and 68,000 years.<br />
<br />
ANU anthropologist Alan Thorne said that neither &quot;Mungo Man's&quot;<br />
completely modern skeleton nor its DNA had any links with human<br />
ancestors from Africa found in other parts of the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither of them (the skeleton or DNA) show any evidence that they ever<br />
were in Africa,&quot; Thorne told Reuters. &quot;There's modern humans in<br />
Australia that have nothing to do with Africa at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The findings, revealed in The Australian newspaper on Tuesday,<br />
challenge the prevailing &quot;out of Africa&quot; theory of evolution<br />
because &quot;Mungo Man&quot; has a genetic line which has vanished yet his<br />
skeleton is completely modern.<br />
<br />
The &quot;out of Africa&quot; theory holds that modern humans evolved from a<br />
common homo erectus ancestor in Africa.<br />
<br />
Homo sapiens then left Africa and spread across the world between<br />
150,000 and 100,000 years ago.<br />
<br />
The ANU researchers say that because Mungo Man is modern anatomically,<br />
yet has a vanished DNA line, it means at least one group of homo<br />
erectus's descendants evolved outside of Africa.<br />
<br />
Under the counter &quot;regional continuity&quot; theory which Thorne supports,<br />
modern man evolved from homo erectus in several different places --<br />
what is now Africa, Europe, east Asia and west Asia -- followed by<br />
interbreeding between the regions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everywhere was becoming modern at roughly the same rate,&quot; Thorne<br />
said. &quot;As they are today, genes were flowing from Shanghai to Paris,<br />
from Singapore to Cape Town.&quot;<br />
<br />
GENETIC FINGERPRINT<br />
<br />
DNA is a kind of genetic fingerprint unique to every individual and<br />
which transmits hereditary characteristics.<br />
<br />
The ANU research says that Mungo Man's mitochondrial DNA contained<br />
different sequences of the four chemicals which form DNA to that which<br />
has been found in other remains. Mitochondria are the energy packs<br />
within cells.<br />
<br />
The previously oldest human DNA tested came from Neanderthal remains --<br />
a 45,000-year-old specimen in western Germany and 28,000-year-old<br />
remains from Croatia.<br />
<br />
While the genetic footprint was different, ANU evolutionary genetecist<br />
Simon Easteal said Mungo Man would have looked very much like modern<br />
humans.<br />
<br />
&quot;This individual has facial features, has morphology that is<br />
essentially modern, that wouldn't stand out in a crowd today,&quot; Easteal<br />
told Reuters.<br />
<br />
&quot;If he was part of a wave of modern people that had come out of Africa<br />
and spread, eventually reaching Australia, then his mitochondrial DNA<br />
would reflect that,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Thorne said the dating of Mungo Man meant there was no doubt that<br />
ancestors of Australia's Aborigines came to the continent from Asia<br />
about 70,000 years ago -- some 30,000 years earlier than was thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no question that somewhere in southeast Asia is where<br />
watercraft got invented,&quot; Thorne said. &quot;The first oceanic crossings<br />
were to Australia.&quot;</div>

&quot;There is no such thing, at this date of the world's history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. <br />
&quot;I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? <br />

&quot;We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. <br />

There are thousands of\nstrangers everywhere, and they are all on an insane variety of drugs.\nThey expect you to be as well.\n\nI had been using Ketamine nasally every couple hours for over three\nweeks, and I'd tripped on mushrooms, LSD, and GHB earlier that week.\nI'd also been using benzodiazapines, barbituates and opiates often in\nthe preceeding week. It had already been a helluva binge, and I felt\nthat since it was the last night of the festival that i had better do\nsomething to top off the week. At around 9pm I ingested 200mg MDMA HCl\norally, 100mg Ketamine nasally and 75mgs of TMA-2 orally. A half hour\nlater, just as I was really coming on to the E and the TMA, I headed\nout to watch the Man burn.\n\nIt was spectacular, but not overwhelming. The visuals were strong, but\nnothing I wasn't used to. As the man fell I drank my dosage of liquid\n2-CB. After the Burn, I headed back towards a friend's camp. When I\narrived no one was present, but I took advantage of a mirror and razor\nthey had laying around. I snorted two more tenths of E and two more\ntenths of Ketamine. As I walked back out onto the playa, the 2-CB, E\nand K all hit me at once. Suddenly I noticed many spatial dimensions\nthat I had never experienced before. I decided to sit down, as I\nsuddenly feared that I may walk off on some spatial tangent, and may\nnot be able to return to the normal three dimensional world.\n\nAs I sat and hallucinated vividly, I lost all sense of what was\n'actually' around me. I soon became conscious that i was in a space\ninhabited by some sort of half-mineral, half-vegetable-type creatures\nthat shared a bizarre collective consciousness. They sort of resembled\na large garden of sandstone carrots connected by jelly-like tentacles.\n\nAs soon as they recognized my presence they tried to communicate with\nme. Their form of communication consisted of disjointed telepathic\nimages and a strange method altering the color hues in the gaseous\natmosphere that filled this bizarre space. I translated their greeting\nas meaning something like, 'Ha, ha, ha - we don't see many of your\nkind here!' They then went on to try to tell me many things that I\nabsolutely could not conceive. The only information that got through\nto me was that these entities had to somehow use deceased members of\ntheir collective to perpetuate their sleep cycle. Without their dead,\nthey could not sleep and would soon die. At the time I translated this\nas 'We stuff our dead and use them as pillows.'\n\nThen, as soon as I had departed, I was sitting back on the playa. I\nwas still hallucinating intensely, but I could make out some semblence\nof reality around me. I had no great insights or revelations during\nthe experience, only a sense of having experienced something utterly\nand totally alien. This combo made DMT look like baby asprin. If you\nhave a hard head for psychedelics and sometime find yourself camping\nout in the desert with 23,000 other drug-crazed freaks i definitly\nsuggest this combo.\n\nAny other scenario would just not be bizarre enough to accomodate it.\nI know, I know ... SkeptiSp00ks'd just write the whole damn thing off\nto extended sleep deprivation exacerbated by amphetamine psychosis but\nthe synchronicities and proofs are far too numerous and wonderous to\nignore.\n\nIt is merely a different frequency \/ dimensional level \/ consciousness\nlevel \/ alternate reality \/ etc.\n\nAnd just as REAL -- if not more so -- than this one. \n\nAll the best; \n\n-Blue Walks Between Worlds\n\n-Blue Resonant Human 33°, 8=3\nInterdimensional Intelligence Analyst\n Sacerdotal Knights of National Security",
