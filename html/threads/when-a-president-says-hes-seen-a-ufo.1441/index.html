When a President Says He's Seen a UFO...<br />
<br />
<br />
would you believe it then???<br />
<br />
<br />
Mary Sutherland @2000<br />
I thought it would be interesting to SHOW that we are not the only ones out there that believe in the UFO phenomena. Thousands of reports come in daily on ufo sightings. Could all these people be delusional? Where do we draw the line as to witness credibility. Apparently no one is listening much to John Q. Public but what about the credibility of World Leaders, Presidents and Top Military Leaders. Surely we must see some underlying truths there concerning this phenomena. Below I have compiled a list of quotes FROM some of the most credible witnesses (well for the most part..smiles) in the world. Let's take a look and see what they have to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Phenomenon is real and we should approach it Seriously and study it'- Mikhail Gorbachev, 1990 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
President George W. Bush<br />
<br />
2000-?<br />
<br />
In a news conference on July 29, 2000, televised on CNN, George W. Bush replied, &quot;Sure I will,&quot; when a citizen asked if he would tell the public &quot;what the hell is going on&quot; with UFOs. Bush indicated that vice-presidential candidate Dick Chaney would use his experience as Secretary of Defense to address the issue... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
William Jefferson Clinton<br />
<br />
42nd President 1993-2000<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to find the answers to two questions for me. One, who killed JFK. And, Two, are there UFOs? &quot;, FROM Friends in High Places, by Webster Hubbell, Clinton's associate attorney general. Hubbel revealed that the President made the UFOs a priority when he appointed him. &quot; He continues: &quot;Clinton was dead serious. I had looked INTO both but he wasn't satisfied with the answers.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ronald Wilson Reagan<br />
<br />
40th. President 1981-1989<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in a plane last week when I looked out the window and saw this white light. It was zigzagging around.&quot; &quot;I went up to the pilot and said, &quot;Have you ever seen anything like that?&quot; He was shocked and he said, &quot;Nope.&quot; And I said to him: &quot;Let's follow it!&quot; &quot;We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light.&quot; &quot;We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up INTO the heavens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it. But we didn't file a report on the object because for a long time they considered you a nut if you saw a UFO...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ronald Reagan, 1974<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
James Earl Carter<br />
<br />
Thirty-Ninth President 1977-1981<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't laugh at people any more when they say they've seen UFOs,&quot; Carter said at a Southern Governors Conference a few years ago. &quot;I've seen one myself.&quot; &quot;It was the darndest thing I've ever seen. It was big, it was very bright, it changed colors and it was about the size of the moon.. We watched it for ten minutes, but none of us could figure out what it was. One thing's for sure, I'll never make fun of people who say they've seen unidentified objects in the sky. I think it was a light beckoning me to run in the California primary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I become President, I'll make every piece of information that this country has about UFO sightings available to the public.&quot; <br />
<br />
The world is still waiting...<br />

Came close and moved away. Is this Venus? Changed shape. Sharply outlined. Venus, again? The color, possible due to the atmosphere.

Did everyone agree?<br />
<br />
Permit me to quote this FROM &quot;Above Top Secret&quot;: During his election campaign of 1976 he told the following to reporters.<br />
<br />
Carter: &quot;It was the darndest thing I've ever seen. It was big, it was very bright, it changed colors and it was about the size of the moon. We watched it for ten minutes, but none of us could figure out what it was. One thing's for sure, I'll never make fun of people who say they've seen unidentified objects in the sky. If I become President, I'll make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and the scientists.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a letter FROM Colonel Charles Senn, Chief of the Air Force <br />
Community Relations Division, to Lieutenant General Duward Crow of <br />
NASA, dated 1 September 1977, Colonel Senn made the following <br />
astonishing statement:<br />
<br />
&quot;I sincerely hope that you are successful in preventing a reopening of UFO investigations.&quot; So it is clear that NASA (as well as the Air Force and almost certainly the CIA and NSA) was anxious to ensure that the President's election pledge remained unfulfilled<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gerald R. Ford<br />
<br />
Thirty-Eighth President 1974-1977<br />
<br />
&quot;The American public deserves a better explanation than that thus far given by the U. S. Air Force, I strongly recommend that there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomena. I think we owe it to the people to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on this subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald Ford never again addressed the issue of UFOs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
John F. Kennedy<br />
<br />
Thirty-Fifth President 1961-1963<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We seek a free flow of information... we are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.&quot;-John F. Kennedy, Nov. 21, 1963. <br />

<br />
THE JFK UFO SIGHTING<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
by Bill Knell<br />
<br />
Over the years I have met people FROM a wide variety of backgrounds who are interested in the UFO phenomenon. One of the most fascinating of all the people who have ever contacted me is a man named Dr. Michael Wolf. A prominent surgeon who once served as an Army Doctor in Vietnam, Wolf is a sold-out UFO buff. He is fascinated with all aspects of the subject. But that didn't just happen, it took a Presidential UFO Sighting.<br />
<br />
Dr. Wolf is FROM New England. His late wife Sara was a Kennedy (a relative of JFK). His in-laws once lived in a house next to the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport, MA. During the summer before JFK was assassinated Michael and Sara Wolf were frequent guests at his in-laws home and aboard JFK's motor launch.<br />
<br />
On one clear and hot summer day Michael and Sara were to go on a brief pleasure cruise aboard the Kennedy launch with JFK and a few other guests, but Michael was severely ill in bed with the flu. He asked Sara to go and represent both of them. <br />
<br />
Just a few minutes INTO the cruise everyone on board the launch (including JFK) were stunned when a disc-shaped object appeared within several hundred feet of their boat. The object was about 60 feet in diameter. The middle was slightly raised and part of a top that was a dull, metallic grayish color. The bottom of the craft was very shiny and hard to look at. There were no noticeable windows or openings. The object seemed noiseless and no signs of obvious propulsion could be seen.<br />
<br />
Everything went INTO chaos. Secret Service Agents on board the launch and nearby in smaller boats scrambled in all directions. The incident did not last long enough (under a minute) to allow for any kind of a response. The Object moved straight up at a tremendous speed and vanished.<br />
<br />
The Launch immediately headed back to the dock. After a short conversation with his Secret Service Detail, President Kennedy told the small GROUP of about 12 people that had been on board, &quot;We don't talk about this!&quot; That's all that was ever said. But Sara couldn't help but tell Michael what had happened.<br />
<br />
This sighting was spectacular because it involved a U.S. President, but it was also typical of many that occur in the Cape Cod area of Massachusetts each year. Nearby Martha's Vineyard is also a place where UFOs are often seen.<br />

<br />
Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe USMC, 1897-1988<br />
<br />
&quot;With control of the universe at stake, a crash program is imperative. We produced the A-bomb, under the huge Manhattan Project, in an amazingly short time. The needs, the urgency today are even greater. The Air Force should end UFO secrecy, give the facts to scientists, the public, to Congress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once the people realize the truth, they would back, even demand a crash program... for this is one race we dare not lose...&quot;<br />
<br />
Maj. Don Keyhoe, Director-NICAP, 1953<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Col. Steve Wilson, USAF, 193?-1997.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no feelings, truthfully. My association with MJ-12 has left me dead inside. I feel myself still cold and calculating. I never let anyone get close to me. I feel like a human robot. I have killed mercilessly and lied for the good of the country, or so I believed at the time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Col. Steve Wilson, USAF (ret.) revealed that he was in charge of Project Pounce, the unit tasked to retrieve downed UFOs and prevent civilian access to them. He also revealed the designations and manufacturers of U.S. antigravity craft.<br />
<br />
&quot;The things I have seen are beyond human understanding and totally unbelievable. I only have a desire to help humanity somehow through what is bound to come soon.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Col. Phillip Corso, U.S. Army, 1913-1998<br />
<br />
&quot;If you suppress the truth it becomes your enemy...if you expose the truth it becomes your weapon.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I had the evidence that a crash did happen. I ask you this, were you there with me? did you have the clearances? they can't answer these questions, they simply criticize with no evidence.&quot;<br />

James V. Forrestal <br />
<br />
Secretary of Defense 1892-1949<br />
<br />
The &quot;truth&quot; was known by only a very few persons... Of the original GROUP that were the first to learn, several committed suicide - the most prominent of which was Defense Secretary James V. Forrestal who jumped to his death FROM a 16th story hospital window. Secretary Forrestal's records are sealed to this day. <br />

President Truman quickly put a lid on the secret and turned the screws so tight that the general public still thinks that flying saucers are a joke. <br />

Gen. Nathan Twining <br />
<br />

&quot;This 'flying saucer' situation is not at all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomena. Something is really flying around. The phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious.&quot;<br />

<br />
UFO comments by the world's top military leaders<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It is time for the truth to be brought out... Behind the scenes high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.... I urge immediate Congressional action to reduce the dangers FROM secrecy about unidentified flying objects.&quot; <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You now face a new world, a world of change. We speak in strange terms, of harnessing the cosmic energy, of ultimate conflict between a united human race and the sinister forces of some other planetary galaxy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The nations of the world will have to unite, for the next war will be an interplanetary war. The nations of the earth must someday make a common front against attack by people FROM other planets.&quot;<br />

&quot;We have, indeed, been contacted -- perhaps even visited -- by extraterrestrial beings, and the US government, in collusion with the other national powers of the Earth, is determined to keep this information FROM the general public.&quot; <br />
<br />
Victor Marchetti, former Special Assistant to the Executive Director of the CIA, in an article written by him for Second Look entitled &quot;How the CIA Views the UFO Phenomenon&quot;, Vol 1, No 7, Washington, DC, May, 1979.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;In any case, the Air Force has arrived to the conclusion that a certain number of anomalous phenomena has been produced within Belgian airspace. The numerous testimonies of ground observations compiled in this SOBEPS book, reinforced by the reports of the night of March 30-31 &lt;1990&gt;, have led us to face the hypothesis that a certain number of unauthorized aerial activities have taken place. Until now, not a single trace of aggressiveness has been signalled; military or civilian air traffic has not been perturbed nor threatened. We can therefore advance that the presumed activities do not constitute a direct menace.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The day will come undoubtedly when the phenomenon will be observed with technological means of detection and collection that won't leave a single doubt about its origin. This should lift a part of the veil that has covered the mystery for a long time. A mystery that continues to the present. But it exists, it is real, and that in itself is an important conclusion.&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;More than 10,000 sightings have been reported, the majority of which cannot be accounted for by any &quot;scientific&quot; explanation... I am convinced that these objects do exist and that they are not manufactured by any nation on Earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can therefore see no alternative to accepting the theory that they come FROM some extraterrestrial source.&quot;<br />

&quot;I must say that if listeners could see for themselves the mass of reports coming in FROM the airborne gendarmerie, FROM the mobile gendarmerie, and FROM the gendarmerie charged with the job of conducting investigations, all of which reports are forwarded by us to the National Center for Space Studies, then they would see that it is all pretty disturbing.&quot;<br />

&quot;First of all, I told a magazine this past January that, as an underdeveloped country with regards to the UFO problem, Japan had to take INTO account what should be done about the UFO question, and that we had to spend more time on these matters. In addition, I said that someone had to solve the UFO problem with far reaching vision at the same time. Secondly, I believe it is a reasonable time to take the UFO problem seriously as a reality... I hope that this Symposium will contribute to peace on Earth FROM the point of view of outer space, and take the first step toward the international cooperation in the field of UFOs.&quot;<br />

&quot;I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are going on that we don't know about--and probably never will unless the Air Force discloses them.&quot;<br />

Thousands of reports come in daily on ufo sightings. Could all these people be delusional? Where do we draw the line as to witness credibility. Apparently no one is listening much to John Q. Public but what about the credibility of World Leaders, Presidents and Top Military Leaders. Surely we must see some underlying truths there concerning this phenomena. Below I have compiled a list of quotes FROM some of the most credible witnesses (well for the most part..smiles) in the world. Let's take a look and see what they have to say.\n\n\n\n\"The Phenomenon is real and we should approach it Seriously and study it'- Mikhail Gorbachev, 1990 \n\n \n\n\n\nPresident George W. Bush\n\n2000-?\n\nIn a news conference on July 29, 2000, televised on CNN, George W. Bush replied, \"Sure I will,\" when a citizen asked if he would tell the public \"what the hell is going on\" with UFOs. Bush indicated that vice-presidential candidate Dick Chaney would use his experience as Secretary of Defense to address the issue... \n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Jefferson Clinton\n\n42nd President 1993-2000\n\n\"I want you to find the answers to two questions for me. One, who killed JFK. And, Two, are there UFOs? \", FROM Friends in High Places, by Webster Hubbell, Clinton's associate attorney general. Hubbel revealed that the President made the UFOs a priority when he appointed him. \" He continues: \"Clinton was dead serious. I had looked INTO both but he wasn't satisfied with the answers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRonald Wilson Reagan\n\n40th. President 1981-1989\n\n\"I was in a plane last week when I looked out the window and saw this white light. It was zigzagging around.\" \"I went up to the pilot and said, \"Have you ever seen anything like that?\" He was shocked and he said, \"Nope.\" And I said to him: \"Let's follow it!\" \"We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light.\" \"We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up INTO the heavens.\"\n\n\"When I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it. But we didn't file a report on the object because for a long time they considered you a nut if you saw a UFO...\"\n\nRonald Reagan, 1974\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Earl Carter\n\nThirty-Ninth President 1977-1981\n\n\"I don't laugh at people any more when they say they've seen UFOs,\" Carter said at a Southern Governors Conference a few years ago. \"I've seen one myself.\" \"It was the darndest thing I've ever seen. It was big, it was very bright, it changed colors and it was about the size of the moon.. We watched it for ten minutes, but none of us could figure out what it was. One thing's for sure, I'll never make fun of people who say they've seen unidentified objects in the sky. I think it was a light beckoning me to run in the California primary.\"\n\n\"If I become President, I'll make every piece of information that this country has about UFO sightings available to the public.\" \n\nThe world is still waiting...\n\nA Presidental Sighting Report\n\n\nDate: 01-03-92 23:41\nFrom: Col. Steve Wilson, USAF\/Ret\nSubj: Jimmy Carter's sighting\n\nI listed only the questions that were responded to. The form was filed with NICAP on Sep. 18, 1973.\n\nCarter's responses are in quotation marks.\n\n1. Name: \"Jimmy Carter\"\nAddress: \"State Capitol Atlanta\"\nOccupation: \"Governor\"\n\n2.

Sharply outlined: \"Yes.\"\n\n18. Was the object- b. Self-luminous?: \"Yes.\"\n\n19. Did the object)s_ rise or fall while in motion?: \"Came close, moved away, came close and then moved away.\"\n\n20. ..Or, if easier, give apparent size in inches on a ruler held at arm's length: \"About the same as moon, maybe a little smaller. Varied FROM brighter\/larger than planet to apparent size of moon.\"\n\n21. How did you happen to notice the object(s)?: \"10-12 men all\nwatched it. Brightness attracted us.\" \n\n22. Where were you and what were you doing at the time?: \"Outdoors\nwaiting for a meeting to begin at 7:30 pm.\"\n\n23. How did the object(s) disappear FROM view?: \"Moved to distance\nthen disappeared.\"\n\n26. Please estimate the distance of the object(s): \"Difficult. Maybe\n300-1000 yards.\"\n\n27. What was the elevation of the object(s) in the sky?: \"About 30 degrees above horizon.\"\n\n28. Names and addresses of other witnesses, if any: \"Ten members of\nLeary Georgia Lions Club.\"\n\n\n31. Please draw a map of the locality of the observation showing North; your position; the direction FROM which the object(s) appeared and disappeared FROM view; the direction of its course over the area; roads, towns, villages, railroads, and other landmarks within a mile.: \"Appeared FROM west about 30 degrees\nup.\"\n\n32. Is there an airport, military, governmental, or research\ninstallation in the area?: \"No.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCame close and moved away. Is this Venus? Changed shape. Sharply outlined. Venus, again? The color, possible due to the atmosphere. Same apparent size as the moon, maybe a little smaller and varied in size. Venus? Moved to distance then disappeared. Venus, again? Has anyone asked Carter if HE saw Venus that night? Did everyone agree?\n\nPermit me to quote this FROM \"Above Top Secret\": During his election campaign of 1976 he told the following to reporters.\n\nCarter: \"It was the darndest thing I've ever seen. It was big, it was very bright, it changed colors and it was about the size of the moon. We watched it for ten minutes, but none of us could figure out what it was. One thing's for sure, I'll never make fun of people who say they've seen unidentified objects in the sky. If I become President, I'll make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and the scientists.\"\n\nIn a letter FROM Colonel Charles Senn, Chief of the Air Force \nCommunity Relations Division, to Lieutenant General Duward Crow of \nNASA, dated 1 September 1977, Colonel Senn made the following \nastonishing statement:\n\n\"I sincerely hope that you are successful in preventing a reopening of UFO investigations.\" So it is clear that NASA (as well as the Air Force and almost certainly the CIA and NSA) was anxious to ensure that the President's election pledge remained unfulfilled\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerald R. Ford\n\nThirty-Eighth President 1974-1977\n\n\"The American public deserves a better explanation than that thus far given by the U. S. Air Force, I strongly recommend that there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomena. I think we owe it to the people to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on this subject.\"\n\nGerald Ford never again addressed the issue of UFOs.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn F. Kennedy\n\nThirty-Fifth President 1961-1963\n\n\n\"We seek a free flow of information... we are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\"-John F. Kennedy, Nov. 21, 1963. \n\n\nTHE JFK UFO SIGHTING\n\n\n\nby Bill Knell\n\nOver the years I have met people FROM a wide variety of backgrounds who are interested in the UFO phenomenon. One of the most fascinating of all the people who have ever contacted me is a man named Dr. Michael Wolf. A prominent surgeon who once served as an Army Doctor in Vietnam, Wolf is a sold-out UFO buff. He is fascinated with all aspects of the subject. But that didn't just happen, it took a Presidential UFO Sighting.\n\nDr. Wolf is FROM New England. His late wife Sara was a Kennedy (a relative of JFK). His in-laws once lived in a house next to the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport, MA. During the summer before JFK was assassinated Michael and Sara Wolf were frequent guests at his in-laws home and aboard JFK's motor launch.\n\nOn one clear and hot summer day Michael and Sara were to go on a brief pleasure cruise aboard the Kennedy launch with JFK and a few other guests, but Michael was severely ill in bed with the flu. He asked Sara to go and represent both of them. \n\nJust a few minutes INTO the cruise everyone on board the launch (including JFK) were stunned when a disc-shaped object appeared within several hundred feet of their boat. The object was about 60 feet in diameter. The middle was slightly raised and part of a top that was a dull, metallic grayish color. The bottom of the craft was very shiny and hard to look at. There were no noticeable windows or openings. The object seemed noiseless and no signs of obvious propulsion could be seen.\n\nEverything went INTO chaos. Secret Service Agents on board the launch and nearby in smaller boats scrambled in all directions. The incident did not last long enough (under a minute) to allow for any kind of a response. The Object moved straight up at a tremendous speed and vanished.\n\nThe Launch immediately headed back to the dock. After a short conversation with his Secret Service Detail, President Kennedy told the small GROUP of about 12 people that had been on board, \"We don't talk about this!\" That's all that was ever said. But Sara couldn't help but tell Michael what had happened.\n\nThis sighting was spectacular because it involved a U.S. President, but it was also typical of many that occur in the Cape Cod area of Massachusetts each year. Nearby Martha's Vineyard is also a place where UFOs are often seen.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaj. Donald E. Keyhoe USMC, 1897-1988\n\n\"With control of the universe at stake, a crash program is imperative. We produced the A-bomb, under the huge Manhattan Project, in an amazingly short time. The needs, the urgency today are even greater. The Air Force should end UFO secrecy, give the facts to scientists, the public, to Congress.\"\n\n\"Once the people realize the truth, they would back, even demand a crash program... for this is one race we dare not lose...\"\n\nMaj. Don Keyhoe, Director-NICAP, 1953\n\n\n\n\n\nCol. Steve Wilson, USAF, 193?-1997.\n\n\"I have no feelings, truthfully. My association with MJ-12 has left me dead inside. I feel myself still cold and calculating. I never let anyone get close to me. I feel like a human robot. I have killed mercilessly and lied for the good of the country, or so I believed at the time.\" \n\nCol. Steve Wilson, USAF (ret.) revealed that he was in charge of Project Pounce, the unit tasked to retrieve downed UFOs and prevent civilian access to them. He also revealed the designations and manufacturers of U.S. antigravity craft.\n\n\"The things I have seen are beyond human understanding and totally unbelievable. I only have a desire to help humanity somehow through what is bound to come soon.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nCol. Phillip Corso, U.S. Army, 1913-1998\n\n\"If you suppress the truth it becomes your enemy...if you expose the truth it becomes your weapon.\" \n\n\"I had the evidence that a crash did happen. I ask you this, were you there with me? did you have the clearances? they can't answer these questions, they simply criticize with no evidence.\"\n\nhttp:\/\/www.livinginthelightms.com\/ufovideos\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nJames V. Forrestal \n\nSecretary of Defense 1892-1949\n\nThe \"truth\" was known by only a very few persons... Of the original GROUP that were the first to learn, several committed suicide - the most prominent of which was Defense Secretary James V. Forrestal who jumped to his death FROM a 16th story hospital window. Secretary Forrestal's records are sealed to this day. \n\nPresident Truman quickly put a lid on the secret and turned the screws so tight that the general public still thinks that flying saucers are a joke. \n\n\n\n\n\nAdmiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter\n\nDirector, Central Intelligence Agency 1947-1950.\n\n\"Unknown objects are operating under intelligent control... It is imperative that we learn where UFO's come FROM and what their purpose is...\".\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGen. Nathan Twining \n\nChief of Staff, US Air Force, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n\n\"This 'flying saucer' situation is not at all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomena. Something is really flying around. The phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Edgar Hoover\n\nDirector FBI 1924-1972\n\n\"The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been requested to assist in the investigation of reported sightings of flying disks...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUFO comments by the world's top military leaders\n\n\n\"It is time for the truth to be brought out... Behind the scenes high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.... I urge immediate Congressional action to reduce the dangers FROM secrecy about unidentified flying objects.\" \n\nFormer CIA Director Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, signed statement to Congress, August 22, 1960. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"You now face a new world, a world of change. We speak in strange terms, of harnessing the cosmic energy, of ultimate conflict between a united human race and the sinister forces of some other planetary galaxy.\"\n\n\"The nations of the world will have to unite, for the next war will be an interplanetary war. The nations of the earth must someday make a common front against attack by people FROM other planets.\"\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur- Oct. 8, 1955\n\n\n\n\n. \n\n \n\n\n\"We have, indeed, been contacted -- perhaps even visited -- by extraterrestrial beings, and the US government, in collusion with the other national powers of the Earth, is determined to keep this information FROM the general public.\" \n\nVictor Marchetti, former Special Assistant to the Executive Director of the CIA, in an article written by him for Second Look entitled \"How the CIA Views the UFO Phenomenon\", Vol 1, No 7, Washington, DC, May, 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\"In any case, the Air Force has arrived to the conclusion that a certain number of anomalous phenomena has been produced within Belgian airspace. The numerous testimonies of ground observations compiled in this SOBEPS book, reinforced by the reports of the night of March 30-31 <1990>, have led us to face the hypothesis that a certain number of unauthorized aerial activities have taken place. Until now, not a single trace of aggressiveness has been signalled; military or civilian air traffic has not been perturbed nor threatened. We can therefore advance that the presumed activities do not constitute a direct menace.\" \n\n\"The day will come undoubtedly when the phenomenon will be observed with technological means of detection and collection that won't leave a single doubt about its origin. This should lift a part of the veil that has covered the mystery for a long time. A mystery that continues to the present. But it exists, it is real, and that in itself is an important conclusion.\" \n\nMajor-General Wilfred de Brouwer, Deputy Chief, Royal Belgian Air Force, \"Postface\" in SOBEPS' Vague d'OVNI sur la Belgique - Un Dossier Exceptionnel, Brussels: SOBEPS, 1991. \n\n\n\n\n\"More than 10,000 sightings have been reported, the majority of which cannot be accounted for by any \"scientific\" explanation... I am convinced that these objects do exist and that they are not manufactured by any nation on Earth.\"\n\n\"I can therefore see no alternative to accepting the theory that they come FROM some extraterrestrial source.\"\n\nAir Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain, printed in Sunday Dispatch, London, July 11, 1954. \n\n\n\n\n. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"I must say that if listeners could see for themselves the mass of reports coming in FROM the airborne gendarmerie, FROM the mobile gendarmerie, and FROM the gendarmerie charged with the job of conducting investigations, all of which reports are forwarded by us to the National Center for Space Studies, then they would see that it is all pretty disturbing.\"\n\nM. Robert Galley, French Minister of Defense, interviewed on radio by Jean-Claude Bourret, February 21, 1974. \n\n\n\n\n\"First of all, I told a magazine this past January that, as an underdeveloped country with regards to the UFO problem, Japan had to take INTO account what should be done about the UFO question, and that we had to spend more time on these matters. In addition, I said that someone had to solve the UFO problem with far reaching vision at the same time. Secondly, I believe it is a reasonable time to take the UFO problem seriously as a reality... I hope that this Symposium will contribute to peace on Earth FROM the point of view of outer space, and take the first step toward the international cooperation in the field of UFOs.\"\n\nToshiki Kaifu, Prime Minister, Japan, in a letter to Mayor Shiotani of Hakui City, dated June 24, 1990, endorsing an upcoming Space & UFO Symposium. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I certainly believe in aliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings that they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities. \"He said he was refused permission to CHECK the Air Force files on UFOs and added,\n\n\"I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are going on that we don't know about--and probably never will unless the Air Force discloses them.\"\n\nSenator Barry Goldwater\n\nFor more accounts go to our video section at http:\/\/www.livinginthelightms.com\/ufovideos\n\nSo far I have 3 pages compiled of ufo sightings and documentaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nAncient Mysteries Study GROUP http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/group\/ancientmysteriesms \n\nBurlington News Ufo & Paranormal http:\/\/group.yahoo.com\/group\/burlingtonnews \n\nUFO VIDEO CLIPS http:\/\/www.livinginthelightms.com\/ufovideos\n<hr size=\"1\" width=\"80%\" color=\"#000099\" align=\"left\">Mr. Daniel E.
