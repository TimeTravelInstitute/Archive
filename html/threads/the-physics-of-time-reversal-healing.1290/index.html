M_Faulkner <br />
Member # T876 of TAP-TEN writes the following for your review...<br />
<br />
Anyone care to comment on the physics of time reversal healing? <br />
Yes, a medical treatment device --- using higher group symmetry <br />
electromagnetics as a great extension of the work by Priore and by <br />
Becker -- that would time-reversed damaged or diseased cells back to <br />
a previous undamaged and disease-free physical state, could be <br />
developed. It would be able to treat (and begin the cure) of such <br />
diseases, with the treatment lasting 2 minutes or so. Three such <br />
treatments, one week apart, would do it. The fundamental approach was <br />
proven in France in the 1960s and early 1970s, in thousands of <br />
revolutionary animal experiments. The effort was suppressed when the <br />
French government changed in 1973. <br />
The O(3) electrodynamics being advanced by the Alpha Foundation's <br />
Institute for Advanced Study, is capable of handling the theoretical <br />
modeling so that good science is developed and utilized. One must be <br />
able to model and use the fourth Minkowski axis (time-domain) as well <br />
as 3-space, and one must have an electrodynamics that has been <br />
modified by quantum field theory. Simply check Mandl and Shaw, <br />
Quantum Field Theory, Wiley, 1984, Chapter 5 to find that neither the <br />
time-polarized (scalar) photon nor the longitudinal photon (in 3-<br />
space) are individually observable, but the combination is observable <br />
as the instantaneous scalar potential. By also incorporating <br />
Whittaker's 1903 decomposition of the scalar potential, but <br />
correcting his misinterpretation of the phase conjugate wave prior to <br />
interaction as being in 3-space after interaction, one transposes the <br />
macroscopic wave decomposition of the scalar potential properly into <br />
agreement with Mandl and Shaw's exposition and thus with quantum <br />
field theory. This also is now in agreement with particle physics' <br />
solution some decades ago (Nobel Prize awarded to Lee and Yang in <br />
1957) of the broken symmetry of opposite charges, and thus of any <br />
dipole, and thus of the scalar potential between the poles of a <br />
dipole. <br />
<br />
The end result of all that is that all EM energy in 3-space comes <br />
from the time domain anyway, and accompanying every longitudinal EM <br />
wave in 3-space there is a corresponding time-polarized EM wave in <br />
the time domain. <br />
<br />
Use of this &quot;longitudinal EM wave in 3-space&quot; also uses the <br />
accompanying &quot;longitudinal EM wave in the time domain (fourth <br />
Minkowski axis ict, where the only variable is the t), whether we <br />
realize it or not (this does not even appear in the standard Maxwell-<br />
Heaviside-Lorentz model). In turn, &quot;pumping&quot; a highly nonlinear <br />
material with LWs in 3-space, also pumps it simultaneously with the <br />
accompanying time-polarized EM waves. Voila! This time-reverses the <br />
mass-energy of the pumped mass itself, because it is a precise <br />
curvature of spacetime where the &quot;curvature energy&quot; is in the time <br />
domain. Hence the 4-space nonobserved masstime is pumped &quot;squeezed&quot; <br />
in the time domain, and the entire mass, its atoms, etc. is time-<br />
reversed back to a previous physical (3-space) condition or state. <br />
This is a dramatic extension of phase conjugate optics, and does not <br />
appear to yet be in the literature, though the basis for it is. <br />
<br />
Thus by properly pumping the body, one can time-reverse every cell-<br />
mass-energy in the entire body, back to a previous physical state -- <br />
genetics and all. You can see what this would do for AIDS, e.g. With <br />
proper development, one could rid the world of the suffering and <br />
dying from most infectious diseases, etc. You can also see how <br />
diabolical this appears to the large pharmaceutical companies. It <br />
would not replace them, but it would dramatically reduce <br />
their &quot;territory&quot; and their great world monopoly on the health <br />
industry. <br />
<br />
That was the mechanism Priore unwittingly used. It works, as proved <br />
by thousands of experiments performed by eminent French scientists <br />
working with Priore, and the results are in the refereed scientific <br />
literature. But no one could figure out the mechanism. It took, in <br />
fact, some 14 years for me to &quot;break&quot; it. We found a way to change <br />
that methodology, to remarkably advance it so that the treatment time <br />
was only about 2 minutes (in an emergency case). The new approach can <br />
also be made very portable, and laptop computer controlled. <br />
<br />
This meant that now we had the gist of a medical approach which could <br />
quickly (2-3 years) be developed in a Manhattan style project, and it <br />
would be ready and available to treat those mass casualties from <br />
terrorist attacks on our cities, and save the majority of those <br />
millions of Americans that are going to die otherwise. So it could <br />
also treat a biological warfare strike where there was no known <br />
effective antibiotic or vaccine available. It could treat a patient <br />
already in advanced stages, and reverse the disease very quickly and <br />
cure the patient. It would, in fact, produce a revolution in medical <br />
therapy. <br />
<br />
So in 1998, we strongly urged/proposed that the U.S. government enter <br />
a crash development program to develop small devices, about the size <br />
of a large suitcase, laptop computer controlled, doing the above. Two <br />
to three years, $50 to $100 million or so would be required, together <br />
with some support from the national medical labs to conduct the lab <br />
animal experiments. A 200+ page package was sent to the DoD, USAF, <br />
NIH, CDC, and several others. No one was interested. At NIH, I never <br />
got out of their &quot;policy&quot; section (translation: spin control). Etc. <br />
<br />
The National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Foundation <br />
are not interested. <br />
<br />
The organized U.S. scientific community is not interested. <br />
<br />
The AMA viciously -- and I do mean viciously -- opposes any <br />
scientific development or research in applying higher group symmetry <br />
electrodynamics. These fellows do not even know what the healing <br />
mechanism of the body is; but focus on the immune system <br />
and &quot;killing&quot; something, or surgical intervention, etc. They have no <br />
knowledge of higher symmetry EM anyway, but at best use the more than <br />
a century old and seriously flawed Maxwell-Heaviside-Lorentz theory, <br />
which cannot even model the body's own electrodynamics used in its <br />
cellular regenerative system. <br />
<br />
Not a single scientist called me to discuss the science involved. No <br />
one checked the cited references in the French scientific literature <br />
where the reports of the experimental results were reported. No one <br />
cared. <br />
<br />
Had they moved, we would have those treatment machines rolling off <br />
the mass production lines now. The first generation systems would be <br />
able to save perhaps 70% of those coming mass casualties from anthrax <br />
etc. Sadly, that was not to be. <br />
<br />
There was no sense of urgency, no interest, and apparently no <br />
qualified (and electrical engineers are NOT qualified to examine <br />
something requiring higher group symmetry electrodynamics) scientists <br />
even examined it. <br />
<br />
We are trying once again to get this done. I filed an invention <br />
disclosure (several) back there, and am in process of filing a formal <br />
patent application. Why patent? It seems to be the only way we can <br />
possibly have any chance of raising the necessary funds to proceed, <br />
since we must go to the private sector. <br />
<br />
The approach, however, is so diametrically opposed to the huge <br />
pharmaceutical industry that essentially they will do whatever is <br />
necessary to stop any development along these lines. One of their <br />
favorite tricks (skullduggery) is very clever entrapment. This is <br />
often attempted by stimulating unwitting folks dying of one disease <br />
or another, to contact an &quot;unliked&quot; researcher they wish to destroy. <br />
These honest and suffering Americans pitifully explain their terrible <br />
condition (their immune system may have been destroyed by <br />
chemotherapy or some such, etc., and they've already been sent home <br />
to die), and beg for advice for a last desperate trial treatment from <br />
one of the many &quot;EM-poppers&quot; out there today that are being touted <br />
and sold by many non-medical folks, and not legally approved for <br />
medical treatment at all. <br />
<br />
It is a heart-rending thing. The real purpose is to prey on one's <br />
personal sympathy and concern for a truly sick person, in very bad <br />
shape, and advise them to try one or the other of such machines. The <br />
individual already has been contacted by another technician-type <br />
(himself secretly given immunity from prosecution) who has offered to <br />
quickly build one of those other gadgets (such as the Lahovsky <br />
multiwave oscillator, which has no legitimate scientific test <br />
studies, etc. in refereed journals), and treat the patient who will <br />
inevitably die. Then the authorities (themselves being used as pawns <br />
in this entrapment game) nail the researcher for &quot;accessory to murder <br />
or to manslaughter&quot;. If he falls for it and advises that such would <br />
be the thing to try, they've got him cold. The machine will be built <br />
in 3 days, the unfortunate dying person treated with it, the person <br />
will die, and the researcher is arrested on charges of accessory to <br />
murder 2 or manslaughter. <br />
<br />
So the unwary legitimate researcher, not himself treating anyone, can <br />
find himself behind bars for the next 20 years. <br />
<br />
For most of the last decade, I've grown very tired of such efforts <br />
continually directed at yours truly (they are also directed against <br />
many other researchers). Perhaps some 30 of them, all stemming from <br />
the same source trying a sophisticated entrapment operation to get <br />
one placed in prison. <br />
<br />
I have a very legalistic document/statement I send such poor folks <br />
making such inquiries, pointing out that I am a researcher only, not <br />
a physician, and I do not and cannot give medical treatment advice to <br />
anyone, on advice of my attorney, nor can I practice medicine without <br />
a license. I do advocate legitimate and legal scientific research in <br />
new areas, but then I also advocate prior proper legal testing of any <br />
processes developed, under proper scientific protocols, and if the <br />
testing is successful, followed by legal and formal approval for <br />
proper medical personnel to use it in medical treatment. <br />
<br />
We are trying once again to get the proper financing and effort going <br />
to develop that device, whose mechanism actually time-reverses the <br />
mass energy of all the cells in the body, and all the dynamics of <br />
that mass-energy, back to a previous disease-free physical state. <br />
<br />
But it is very sad. The medical profession doesn't seem to realize <br />
that &quot;medical magic&quot; can indeed be worked with and upon mass by <br />
advanced physics, and that modern electrodynamics is far beyond what <br />
they insist on using (Maxwell-Heaviside-Lorentz standard <br />
theory). 'The report you just sent me -- Reuters release, Sept. 26, <br />
2001 -- deals with successful experiments by physicists in Denmark <br />
who have demonstrated direct interaction of macroscopic masses at a <br />
distance, portending mass teleportation. This has actually been in <br />
quantum mechanics for decades; and as the article points out, <br />
Einstein called it &quot;spooky action at a distance.&quot; <br />
<br />
I will tell you something else, but will not discuss it further. Two <br />
groups (at least one is a foreign nation, I am not sure of the other) <br />
have highly developed that effect in great secrecy, and can already <br />
use it as a weapon. Enough said on that subject. <br />
<br />
So we will try again. There is now a new Theater of Operations for <br />
the American Government and Armed Forces, and it is the North <br />
American Theater itself. We are now the targets. The terrorists (some <br />
thousands) have already been inserted in our midst, along with the <br />
weapons including weapons of mass destruction. There are going to be <br />
more strikes against our cities and our populace, and probably <br />
including chemical and biological warfare (BW) strikes. The OTA study <br />
for the Congress a few years back, shows the kind of casualties that <br />
can be inflicted by BW attack. A single attack on Washington D.C., <br />
e.g., in a single light-plane anthrax spray scenario, will produce <br />
from 1 to 3 million casualties. And the city would be horribly <br />
contaminated as well, for an indefinite number of decades. That is <br />
the harsh reality we are facing. There are also nuclear weapons <br />
already hidden in our cities. <br />
<br />
In short, this war is going to be long, difficult, and much of it is <br />
going to be fought right here in the United States, in Canada, and in <br />
Mexico. It is going to be different from any other war we have <br />
fought. And it may kill more Americans than all the wars in our <br />
history, put together. <br />
<br />
You can see why an old dog like me, suffering hypoxia and still <br />
trying to recover, is so determined to proceed with an attempt to get <br />
this new kind of medical treatment ready and available. We must now <br />
wait until those millions of Americans are already dying in the <br />
streets. This nation is woefully unprepared for this kind of warfare. <br />
We have known of the threat for two decades, and also known it was <br />
increasing. But we have not taken the steps -- particularly in <br />
developing radical new treatment methodologies for those millions of <br />
Americans who heartrendingly are going to die right in the streets. <br />
<br />
Check the National Science Foundation website and the National <br />
Academy of Sciences website. See if you find anything of any <br />
importance addressing this area. You will not find it. They are <br />
apparently not interested, as determined by what material they <br />
already show you is in their planning. <br />
<br />
I personally do not believe that the U.S. government, due to the <br />
reluctance of the Medical Science community, NSF, and NAS, will fund <br />
or even consider such a program, regardless of how many lives it <br />
would save. It doesn't match the present established scientific <br />
dogma, and it doesn't enrich (but seriously threatens in the future) <br />
the large pharmaceutical industry. <br />
<br />
So we will joust with the great windmills one more time, and give it <br />
our best shot, even though we are almost certain to fail. The moral <br />
imperative is so great than we simply cannot let it lie and walk away <br />
from it, so long as there is any chance at all. <br />

<br />
- Any particle's antiparticle can be viewed as a time-axis-flipped version of the original particle. If time reversal was actually achieved, why did the time-reversed matter not annihilate with the surrounding tissue in a massive-yield explosion?<br />
<br />
- The gist of this is just shooting light at the tissue, right? I mean, &quot;longitudinal EM waves&quot; is just a fancy way of saying plain old light, or other EM radiation.<br />
<br />
- How would this help cure AIDS? surely the AIDS viruses would simply revert to a previous state, but remain in the body - if they were to move, nothing in principle is to stop the tissue moving as well, with disastrous effects.<br />
<br />
- AFAIK, no one has shown a way to feasably produce teleportation on a macroscopic scale. If this guy knows how, he should publish and become famous!</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">Time02112: Lord have I missed your mind--Time--you ole rattle snake! Ah yesss the trilateralists are hard at work batting down anything that may unbalance the status quo. The car that ran on water instead of gasoline was purchased and destroyed by the oil companys. The washing machine that worked better then any other using air forced through water, (no detergent) was grabbed by the detergent companys and destroyed. I guarantee that when the first fully functioning nanabot that can perform surgury from inside and clear blocked arteries while the patient is playing a game of tennis, the AMA will buy the rights and it will dissappear forever. As usual, the technical aspect of what you describe has left me in the dust but the concept must be similar in reaction to incidents I have read about involving large groups praying for a terminal patient and total reversal of illness results. Such incidents are rare but are documented. Somehow the dynamics must be related. Very few people actually understand the reality of how this planet works. Money. Banking. Finance. That's all there is. If the greatest discovery throws the financial system off, it's history. Sad but true. Cures are discarded. There's trillions of dollars at stake and we are expendable. What you speak of Time may work but if it goes against the health care industry it will dissappear like tears in the rain.</div>

		"articleBody": "http:\/\/sc.communities.msn.com\/tn\/77\/71\/MagiForums\/2\/1.jpg\nM_Faulkner \nMember # T876 of TAP-TEN writes the following for your review...\n\nAnyone care to comment on the physics of time reversal healing? \nYes, a medical treatment device --- using higher group symmetry \nelectromagnetics as a great extension of the work by Priore and by \nBecker -- that would time-reversed damaged or diseased cells back to \na previous undamaged and disease-free physical state, could be \ndeveloped. It would be able to treat (and begin the cure) of such \ndiseases, with the treatment lasting 2 minutes or so. Three such \ntreatments, one week apart, would do it. The fundamental approach was \nproven in France in the 1960s and early 1970s, in thousands of \nrevolutionary animal experiments. The effort was suppressed when the \nFrench government changed in 1973. \nThe O(3) electrodynamics being advanced by the Alpha Foundation's \nInstitute for Advanced Study, is capable of handling the theoretical \nmodeling so that good science is developed and utilized. One must be \nable to model and use the fourth Minkowski axis (time-domain) as well \nas 3-space, and one must have an electrodynamics that has been \nmodified by quantum field theory. Simply check Mandl and Shaw, \nQuantum Field Theory, Wiley, 1984, Chapter 5 to find that neither the \ntime-polarized (scalar) photon nor the longitudinal photon (in 3-\nspace) are individually observable, but the combination is observable \nas the instantaneous scalar potential. By also incorporating \nWhittaker's 1903 decomposition of the scalar potential, but \ncorrecting his misinterpretation of the phase conjugate wave prior to \ninteraction as being in 3-space after interaction, one transposes the \nmacroscopic wave decomposition of the scalar potential properly into \nagreement with Mandl and Shaw's exposition and thus with quantum \nfield theory. This also is now in agreement with particle physics' \nsolution some decades ago (Nobel Prize awarded to Lee and Yang in \n1957) of the broken symmetry of opposite charges, and thus of any \ndipole, and thus of the scalar potential between the poles of a \ndipole. \n\nThe end result of all that is that all EM energy in 3-space comes \nfrom the time domain anyway, and accompanying every longitudinal EM \nwave in 3-space there is a corresponding time-polarized EM wave in \nthe time domain. \n\nUse of this \"longitudinal EM wave in 3-space\" also uses the \naccompanying \"longitudinal EM wave in the time domain (fourth \nMinkowski axis ict, where the only variable is the t), whether we \nrealize it or not (this does not even appear in the standard Maxwell-\nHeaviside-Lorentz model). In turn, \"pumping\" a highly nonlinear \nmaterial with LWs in 3-space, also pumps it simultaneously with the \naccompanying time-polarized EM waves. Voila! This time-reverses the \nmass-energy of the pumped mass itself, because it is a precise \ncurvature of spacetime where the \"curvature energy\" is in the time \ndomain. Hence the 4-space nonobserved masstime is pumped \"squeezed\" \nin the time domain, and the entire mass, its atoms, etc. is time-\nreversed back to a previous physical (3-space) condition or state. \nThis is a dramatic extension of phase conjugate optics, and does not \nappear to yet be in the literature, though the basis for it is. \n\nThus by properly pumping the body, one can time-reverse every cell-\nmass-energy in the entire body, back to a previous physical state -- \ngenetics and all. You can see what this would do for AIDS, e.g. With \nproper development, one could rid the world of the suffering and \ndying from most infectious diseases, etc. You can also see how \ndiabolical this appears to the large pharmaceutical companies. It \nwould not replace them, but it would dramatically reduce \ntheir \"territory\" and their great world monopoly on the health \nindustry. \n\nThat was the mechanism Priore unwittingly used. It works, as proved \nby thousands of experiments performed by eminent French scientists \nworking with Priore, and the results are in the refereed scientific \nliterature. But no one could figure out the mechanism. It took, in \nfact, some 14 years for me to \"break\" it. We found a way to change \nthat methodology, to remarkably advance it so that the treatment time \nwas only about 2 minutes (in an emergency case). The new approach can \nalso be made very portable, and laptop computer controlled. \n\nThis meant that now we had the gist of a medical approach which could \nquickly (2-3 years) be developed in a Manhattan style project, and it \nwould be ready and available to treat those mass casualties from \nterrorist attacks on our cities, and save the majority of those \nmillions of Americans that are going to die otherwise. So it could \nalso treat a biological warfare strike where there was no known \neffective antibiotic or vaccine available. It could treat a patient \nalready in advanced stages, and reverse the disease very quickly and \ncure the patient. It would, in fact, produce a revolution in medical \ntherapy. \n\nSo in 1998, we strongly urged\/proposed that the U.S. government enter \na crash development program to develop small devices, about the size \nof a large suitcase, laptop computer controlled, doing the above. Two \nto three years, $50 to $100 million or so would be required, together \nwith some support from the national medical labs to conduct the lab \nanimal experiments. A 200+ page package was sent to the DoD, USAF, \nNIH, CDC, and several others. No one was interested. At NIH, I never \ngot out of their \"policy\" section (translation: spin control). Etc. \n\nThe National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Foundation \nare not interested. \n\nThe organized U.S. scientific community is not interested. \n\nThe AMA viciously -- and I do mean viciously -- opposes any \nscientific development or research in applying higher group symmetry \nelectrodynamics. These fellows do not even know what the healing \nmechanism of the body is; but focus on the immune system \nand \"killing\" something, or surgical intervention, etc. They have no \nknowledge of higher symmetry EM anyway, but at best use the more than \na century old and seriously flawed Maxwell-Heaviside-Lorentz theory, \nwhich cannot even model the body's own electrodynamics used in its \ncellular regenerative system. \n\nNot a single scientist called me to discuss the science involved. No \none checked the cited references in the French scientific literature \nwhere the reports of the experimental results were reported. No one \ncared. \n\nHad they moved, we would have those treatment machines rolling off \nthe mass production lines now. The first generation systems would be \nable to save perhaps 70% of those coming mass casualties from anthrax \netc. Sadly, that was not to be. \n\nThere was no sense of urgency, no interest, and apparently no \nqualified (and electrical engineers are NOT qualified to examine \nsomething requiring higher group symmetry electrodynamics) scientists \neven examined it. \n\nWe are trying once again to get this done. I filed an invention \ndisclosure (several) back there, and am in process of filing a formal \npatent application. Why patent? It seems to be the only way we can \npossibly have any chance of raising the necessary funds to proceed, \nsince we must go to the private sector. \n\nThe approach, however, is so diametrically opposed to the huge \npharmaceutical industry that essentially they will do whatever is \nnecessary to stop any development along these lines. One of their \nfavorite tricks (skullduggery) is very clever entrapment. This is \noften attempted by stimulating unwitting folks dying of one disease \nor another, to contact an \"unliked\" researcher they wish to destroy. \nThese honest and suffering Americans pitifully explain their terrible \ncondition (their immune system may have been destroyed by \nchemotherapy or some such, etc., and they've already been sent home \nto die), and beg for advice for a last desperate trial treatment from \none of the many \"EM-poppers\" out there today that are being touted \nand sold by many non-medical folks, and not legally approved for \nmedical treatment at all. \n\nIt is a heart-rending thing. The real purpose is to prey on one's \npersonal sympathy and concern for a truly sick person, in very bad \nshape, and advise them to try one or the other of such machines. The \nindividual already has been contacted by another technician-type \n(himself secretly given immunity from prosecution) who has offered to \nquickly build one of those other gadgets (such as the Lahovsky \nmultiwave oscillator, which has no legitimate scientific test \nstudies, etc. in refereed journals), and treat the patient who will \ninevitably die. Then the authorities (themselves being used as pawns \nin this entrapment game) nail the researcher for \"accessory to murder \nor to manslaughter\". If he falls for it and advises that such would \nbe the thing to try, they've got him cold. The machine will be built \nin 3 days, the unfortunate dying person treated with it, the person \nwill die, and the researcher is arrested on charges of accessory to \nmurder 2 or manslaughter. \n\nSo the unwary legitimate researcher, not himself treating anyone, can \nfind himself behind bars for the next 20 years. \n\nFor most of the last decade, I've grown very tired of such efforts \ncontinually directed at yours truly (they are also directed against \nmany other researchers). Perhaps some 30 of them, all stemming from \nthe same source trying a sophisticated entrapment operation to get \none placed in prison. \n\nI have a very legalistic document\/statement I send such poor folks \nmaking such inquiries, pointing out that I am a researcher only, not \na physician, and I do not and cannot give medical treatment advice to \nanyone, on advice of my attorney, nor can I practice medicine without \na license. I do advocate legitimate and legal scientific research in \nnew areas, but then I also advocate prior proper legal testing of any \nprocesses developed, under proper scientific protocols, and if the \ntesting is successful, followed by legal and formal approval for \nproper medical personnel to use it in medical treatment. \n\nWe are trying once again to get the proper financing and effort going \nto develop that device, whose mechanism actually time-reverses the \nmass energy of all the cells in the body, and all the dynamics of \nthat mass-energy, back to a previous disease-free physical state. \n\nBut it is very sad. The medical profession doesn't seem to realize \nthat \"medical magic\" can indeed be worked with and upon mass by \nadvanced physics, and that modern electrodynamics is far beyond what \nthey insist on using (Maxwell-Heaviside-Lorentz standard \ntheory). 'The report you just sent me -- Reuters release, Sept. 26, \n2001 -- deals with successful experiments by physicists in Denmark \nwho have demonstrated direct interaction of macroscopic masses at a \ndistance, portending mass teleportation. This has actually been in \nquantum mechanics for decades; and as the article points out, \nEinstein called it \"spooky action at a distance.\" \n\nI will tell you something else, but will not discuss it further. Two \ngroups (at least one is a foreign nation, I am not sure of the other) \nhave highly developed that effect in great secrecy, and can already \nuse it as a weapon. Enough said on that subject. \n\nSo we will try again. There is now a new Theater of Operations for \nthe American Government and Armed Forces, and it is the North \nAmerican Theater itself. We are now the targets. The terrorists (some \nthousands) have already been inserted in our midst, along with the \nweapons including weapons of mass destruction. There are going to be \nmore strikes against our cities and our populace, and probably \nincluding chemical and biological warfare (BW) strikes. The OTA study \nfor the Congress a few years back, shows the kind of casualties that \ncan be inflicted by BW attack. A single attack on Washington D.C., \ne.g., in a single light-plane anthrax spray scenario, will produce \nfrom 1 to 3 million casualties. And the city would be horribly \ncontaminated as well, for an indefinite number of decades. That is \nthe harsh reality we are facing. There are also nuclear weapons \nalready hidden in our cities. \n\nIn short, this war is going to be long, difficult, and much of it is \ngoing to be fought right here in the United States, in Canada, and in \nMexico. It is going to be different from any other war we have \nfought. And it may kill more Americans than all the wars in our \nhistory, put together. \n\nYou can see why an old dog like me, suffering hypoxia and still \ntrying to recover, is so determined to proceed with an attempt to get \nthis new kind of medical treatment ready and available. We must now \nwait until those millions of Americans are already dying in the \nstreets. This nation is woefully unprepared for this kind of warfare. \nWe have known of the threat for two decades, and also known it was \nincreasing. But we have not taken the steps -- particularly in \ndeveloping radical new treatment methodologies for those millions of \nAmericans who heartrendingly are going to die right in the streets. \n\nCheck the National Science Foundation website and the National \nAcademy of Sciences website. See if you find anything of any \nimportance addressing this area. You will not find it. They are \napparently not interested, as determined by what material they \nalready show you is in their planning. \n\nI personally do not believe that the U.S. government, due to the \nreluctance of the Medical Science community, NSF, and NAS, will fund \nor even consider such a program, regardless of how many lives it \nwould save. It doesn't match the present established scientific \ndogma, and it doesn't enrich (but seriously threatens in the future) \nthe large pharmaceutical industry. \n\nSo we will joust with the great windmills one more time, and give it \nour best shot, even though we are almost certain to fail. The moral \nimperative is so great than we simply cannot let it lie and walk away \nfrom it, so long as there is any chance at all. \nhttp:\/\/www.cheniere.org\/correspondence\/092701.htm\n\n---Michael \n\nThe soft-minded man always fears change. He feels security in the \nstatus quo, and he has an almost morbid fear of the new.
