<br />
The Photon Belt<br />
<br />
An Article by Virgil Armstrong ©1995<br />
<br />
From: <a href="http://www.2012.com.au/Photon_belt.html" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.2012.com.au/Photon_belt.html</a><br />
<br />
Lately there has been much talk about the Photon Belt and the accompanying manasic radiation, both scientific terms for this spectacular coming event.<br />
<br />
Science first admitted knowledge of this phenomenon in 1962, 33 years ago! As for us, the public, awareness oft his event came much later, and sadly, only to a very small number of people.<br />
<br />
Even when I first heard of the Photon Belt, I was inclined, through ignorance, to give it little credence. In fact, my first reaction was, &quot;the ,Wu-Wu´s´ are at it again. They have invented a new wrinkle to make more money.&quot; This was almost a colossal mistake on my part, but Spirit had its way and notified me that it was real. Spirit also said I must understand the phenomenon and go forward to inform the world of the true realities of the Photon Belt.<br />
<br />
At this point, I began to take this phenomenon seriously, and after considerable research and study, I was ready to step forward and begin speaking about the Photon Belt. I first introduced it to the public in Columbus, Ohio, in October 1994, followed immediately by an extensive speaking tour in Europe. Much to my surprise, the subject was enthusiastically received everywhere I went. The following is a discussion of the subject for you, the reader.<br />
<br />
The Photon Belt and the manasic radiation have a greater impact than one might imagine. From the scientific point of view, it is the procession of our Solar System and its accompanying planets around the Central Sun, called Alcione, located in the constellation of Pleiades. This counter-clockwise cyclic procession around Alcione requires 25,860 years to make one complete orbit. Our present-day sun, moon, and planets must twice pass through the Photon Belt during this time, that is, once to the North and once to the South. (See diagram, below.) During this cycle, there are two periods of darkness and two periods of light. The periods of darkness, which constitute the vast majority of the rotation around the Central Sun, consist of two periods of 10,500 years each, plus an additional, seemingly optional 430 years for both of the 10,500-year periods. (i.e., 10,500+430 = 10,930 years, times 2=21,860 years).<br />
<br />
Following each period of 10,500 years of darkness, we then emerge into 2000 years of total light, which actually constitutes the Photon Belt. In review, we then have 21,860 years of darkness and 4,000 years of light (21,860 + 4,000 = 25,860 years, or one complete cycle/orbit). Again, please refer to the diagram below.<br />
<br />
Another way of viewing this phenomenon is that in one complete orbit, we have five sixths darkness and approximately one-sixth light, or a 5:1 ratio, with darkness being predominant. Surprisingly enough, we are now, as a Solar System and planet, once again emerging from 10,500+ years of darkness and preparing to merge into 2000 years of light, which we will begin to experience in the year 2000. The foregoing is a general scientific understanding of the Photon Belt phenomenon, but what about its spiritual significance? A question in your mind might be, &quot;Why does the darkness, or negative aspect, of our 26,OOO-yearjourney around the Central Sun predominate? Why not more light?&quot; As in all things in the Creators omni-universes, everything has divine purpose and reason. All aspects are in synchronicity with one another: the higher with the lower, the lower with the higher; or, to quote Kabalistic law, &quot;as it is above, so shall it be below; as it is below, so shall it be above.&quot; It is important to understand that divine law has intent and purpose. What I am about to relate spiritually will lend greater individual understanding and acceptance of what would otherwise appear to be punitive and unreasonable.<br />
<br />
The reason we experience five-sixths more darkness in our journey around the Central Sun is because the divine powers, in concert with those of us who were chosen, agreed to create and experience a world of negativity (darkness), polarities, and illusion encrusted with fear, judgments, control, hate, greed, death, and much more. This was a contrived plan which facilitated the Creator´s desire to better understand the true nature of negativity, or its shadow self This explosive and unpredictable world, likened to a veritable mine field, is designed to test the mettle of all associated with this special planet, Planet Earth. We are the vehicle through which the divine can experience itself; and through our individual and collective experiences, can master the intricacies and dangers of darkness. We have been selectively chosen to come here.<br />
<br />
Many, upon hearing this, would venture to say this is insane, but nonetheless, it is true. We are unique, one of a kind. We are the chosen vehicle (planet) to collect, assimilate, and transform all negativity for our entire Solar System. We are the dumping ground and refuse holding area for the whole Solar System. Through our thoughts, actions, and reactions, we serve as transformers for all negativity being thrust upon us. What a task! So you see that what might be adjudged as something totally negative and uncalled for is, in truth, endowed with Spirit and its divine mission here on Earth. That mission is to experience through us the negativity for self and in the process, learn how to dispense with it more expeditiously and permanently, making all else a better place to live and work. So, you see, we and our planet are unique and special.<br />
<br />
Undoubtedly, the next question is, &quot;How does this relate to the Photon Belt?&quot; This is a complex question, but before getting into the intricacies of it, let us first establish that the Photon Belt and accompanying manasic radiation are in and of themselves vehicles of transformation and transmutation. They are the guardian barrier and vehicle to see that none of the negativity of Earth escapes and contaminates the higher levels of consciousness. Presiding over all of this is the Christ, and upon knowing this, we can quickly see that the Photon Belt and the manasic radiation are the eminence of the Christ and its christed energies. Unless we are in accord with these energies, as we approach and enter the Photon Belt, we cannot hope to be a part of it and escape the negative influences of Planet Earth.<br />
<br />
In that sense, we would have to return to the third dimension and do it all over again. Ironic as it may seem, before each of us came to Planet Earth, we were fully aware of the inherent dangers of coming to Earth and living and experiencing its gross negativities. We were also informed that we could not escape the influence of negativity until we had mastered it, which, of course, was the divine intent all along, for how can the divine learn and experience self other than through us? Unfortunately some are slower learners than others, and it takes repeated turns around the wheel (the Central Sun) before the lesson is learned. Usually about one-third of the planet´s then total population is successful in each 10,500-year period.<br />
<br />
Reflect on some of what I have said, such as &quot;you are chosen; you could not be here this time around without approval; and you cannot leave, even though you volunteered, until you have completely mastered negativity.&quot; Indeed, that is a big task but you will do it sooner or later. When you have accomplished this, the rewards on the other side are inestimable; and because you have mastered and graduated from this toughest of learning schools in the Creator´s domain, you will jump grades ahead of your contemporaries on the other side. So don´t despair for you are Gods in amnesia, and you are not destined to fail for long! Let´s return to the subject of the Christ and its relationship to the Photon Belt. The Christ and its energies are repeatedly mentioned in ancient texts, indicating that unless we can become one with these christed energies, we cannot hope to survive the coming calamities and pass through the Photon Belt. The Mayan prophecies clearly signal this in a profound statement which says, &quot;government, science and religion will collapse unless they are prepared to accept and facilitate the incoming Christ consciousness.&quot; Once again, this is an oblique reference to the Photon Belt and its christed energies (the manasic radiation). All things obsolete, archaic, and negative, including YOU, will break down in the face of the incoming Christ energies unless you and it will accept and live these sacred truths. The great avatar, Jesus, while on Earth made this abundantly clear when he said, &quot;1, through the Christ, shall separate the wheat from the tares, the sheep from the goats.&quot; Implied was that humanity, as it approaches the end days and the Photon Belt, will be divided into two camps, that is, those who can and will accept the incoming Christ consciousness (the wheat and the sheep), and those who will not or cannot (the tares and the goats). As we near the entrance into the Photon Belt, which will take place in or about the year 2000, all of this will become abundantly clear. Note that the year 2000 also marks our entrance into the fourth dimension as a peoples, planet, and consciousness. Be reminded that it is destined that our planet be assured safe passage into and through the Photon Belt. The only question is, will you and I receive the same accord? The answer is yes, only if we, too, can accept, accommodate, and act out the incoming Christ consciousness.<br />
<br />
In quick review, I hope that I have impressed upon your mind that the Photon Belt is something far greater than astronomical or scientific postulates as to how the Solar System and its planets rotate around Alcione, our Central Sun, and how, in this process, our Solar System and planets experience 21,860 years of darkness and 4,000 years of light. I trust I have convinced you that the whole process is a profound sequential spiritual experience, dealing directly with the Christ consciousness.<br />
<br />
Let us now go into this spiritual experience more deeply. To begin with, the Photon Belt really is nothing new. In ancient history there are many references, particularly by the Greeks and Romans, to a Golden Age wherein there was nothing but light, love, peace and tranquility, a place where death, war, famine, disease, and poverty were unknown. These ancient philosophers were obviously alluding to the Photon Belt, that 2000-year period of light. Once again we are at that point where we are about to enter into this phenomenal period of light, the Golden Age of the past and the future. We are emerging from our oppressive cocoon of darkness and, like the butterfly, can emerge as something extremely beautiful, that is, our light bodies and our total communion with the Christ. That cocoon of darkness, despite its oppressiveness and negativity, has been our teaching and learning vehicle to qualify us once again to return from whence we came, the Photon Belt. We are again being offered the opportunity to break the fetters of this world of illusion to turn the mirror around, and in its place perceive our true reality. With this, the restraints of negativity, illusion, polarities, judgments, control, hate, avarice and greed, jealously, killings and war will all fall away. Our special Earth assignment, which has been to experience and master negativity and illusion, will be fulfilled, and we can go home where we rightly belong. As we approach the Photon Belt and its eminence, the manasic radiation, we will become aware of the Christ consciousness and the call to arms. The call to arms is a declaration by the Christ that we have been in darkness long enough and now it is time to go home into the light. In the final analysis, however, the choice is our though our free will. The going-home process is not as simple as it would first seem, for we must first experience a tremendous transformational process which will enable us to eliminate our negativity and assume our bodies of light. This, in turn, will catapult us out of the enslaving energies of the third dimension into the fourth and fifth dimensions - the Photon Belt.<br />
<br />
This quantum leap into the future is not customary but is usually sequential in nature, encompassing one dimension at a time. However, due to our unexplained unwillingness to grow and mature with the dictates of the divine scenario, in contrast to the other planets, we must now play catch-up and attain the level of the other planets in order for the Solar System to remain in keeping with divine intent and scheduled advancement. We must finally be brought to terms in order to insure safe passage by the entire federation of planets into the Photon Belt. We have just a few years until the year 2000 to do this. This is not only the entrance into the Photon Belt but also the fourth dimension. By the year 2005, five years into the Photon Belt, we will have reached our ultimate objective, the fifth dimension! An interesting fact: the Lost Books of the Bible, that is, the original and unabridged version of our current Bible, states that &quot;The second coming of the Christ will occur in the year 2005.&quot; This then implies that we will witness and experience the second coming of the Christ only after we have attained the fifth dimension of consciousness. We will by then have long abandoned our bodies of density and will be wearing our garments of light, just as the Christ always has.<br />
<br />
Before any of this can happen, we must first experience a complete transformational process here on Earth. Our planet, our bodies, and our consciousness all must achieve and resonate at a much higher and intense frequency in order to accommodate the incoming Christ consciousness. Let´s begin with one aspect of our planet´s transformation. Our present speed as we as a planet fly through space is estimated to be about 18,000 miles per hour. Consider then the speculation that upon entering the Photon Belt, we will have reached a speed of 208,000 miles per hour, or an increase of 190,000 miles per hour. One does not have to speculate very long to realize this tremendous acceleration will compress time and space into realms of realizations, incomprehensible at this time. What can be assumed is that all things mundane and corporeal in nature will undergo tremendous transformation in order to be in harmony with the compression and accelerated speed. Every cell in our body´ every molecule, every atom will be rearranged so as to (hopefully) transform our current bodies of density and morality into a vehicle of transformational light, capable of facilitating the incoming Christ consciousness and its immortality. It is also said that in the transformational process, our DNA system will be rearranged from a system of 2 strands to a system of 12 or 13 strands. Our chakras will also be rearranged and increased, going from 7 to 12 or 13. Our atoms will be increased and rearranged in order to facilitate the incoming light (Christ consciousness).<br />
<br />
Following through with the transformational theory, it seems reasonable that our beloved planet, a living organism, must also transform to receive the Christ consciousness. This procedure will emerge in the much heralded Earth changes, representing dissolution of the old and archaic illusionary concepts. Today there is much discussion and conjecture about the Earth changes and how they will affect us individually and collectively. For your information, the Earth changes have already begun in the form of recent earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and unpredictable and devastating weather patterns. To be honest, this is only the beginning and will become more intense and deadly, for how else can the purgation of the old and archaic be accomplished, whether it be the planet or the body? In the process nothing, I repeat, nothing will remain untouched. We can expect total chaos, dissolution, rearrangement and total destruction. Nothing, unless they or it are in harmony with the divine Christ consciousness, will be spared. Sadly enough, the Illuminati (secret government) as well as the world frontal governments, have discovered too late that their displacement to the Moon and Mars and inner Earth in order to avoid the coming Earth changes has been for naught because the Moon and Mars, as well as the other planets, must also reform in order to survive.<br />
<br />
This escapism policy, which says, &quot;to hell with the multitudes and hurrah for us,&quot; must bear a heavy price, and I wish them well. In summary, I can only say that their celebrated egos have been dealt a mortal blow. I am sure, too, that this august body has alternatives in mind, such as riding out the catastrophic changes in their advanced space ships, but this will not succeed because the universal laws of retribution will prevail, and all things, large and small, must be held accountable. To explain further, unless all things mundane and physical are in harmony with the incoming Christ energies (fourth and fifth dimensions), they will, despite their most zealous attempts to escape the reality of these super energies, be consigned to failure. Hovering in space to escape the physical is no exception.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, in the dialog above, I have created an element of fear among you readers. This, of course, was not my intention, but it does serve a point.<br />
<br />
Mass chaos and destruction, although present for the many, need not affect you personally. Repeatedly throughout these writings I have ventured that all will be spared if they will acknowledge the incoming Christ energies and strive to walk and talk in love, light, balance, and forgiveness. In the process you will be creating your new and wondrous body of light. As you, &quot;through the above,&quot; build your body of light´ you will be resistant and ultimately impervious to all physical and archaic laws. Remember that when you have a body of light, you are one with the Christ and the fourth dimension. Therefore, your physical being is not of density and matter, so how can you get hurt? Fear is food for the darker and negative forces and is the vehicle through which they have controlled Us over the millennia.<br />
<br />
Without fear, they have no way to control us and so are impotent. Remember this when you most need it.<br />
<br />
With this as an overview, I would now like to present in general some experiences which will occur upon entering the Photon Belt. Keep in mind that these are some of what may be expected. Many more will arise of which we are as yet unaware. Some of these have already been mentioned but are equally important with the rest.<br />
<br />
1. The Photon Belt and the manasic radiation are vehicles of transformation. The Photon Belt is the home of the Christ; the radiation is the emerging eminence of the Christ. Through these spiritual vehicles, provided we work with them, we are being given the opportunity to break the current restraints of bondage and go home from whence we originally came. However, the choice is ours. Free will will prevail.<br />
<br />
2. The new moon solar eclipse on November 3, 1994, along with its predecessor, the lunar eclipse of the sun in 1991, amplified the love of our Mother God. Along with everything else, our consciousness is being restructured to a state of balance wherein we will become equal parts of the feminine and masculine energies, just as Jesus did; we will become androgynous, that is, 50% male and 50% female. The emphasis is being placed on the feminine because the male energies are now discordant, archaic, and too fixed. Take a look around your world and see the insanity of man in Yugoslavia, Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Russia, and yes, even the United States. The feminine must transcend and transform these old male patterns before the christed energies can be balanced here on Earth. If we are to survive, look for the emergence of the soft male and the strong woman. Women, remember this! Your greatest and most sacred strength on Earth is your femininity; it is the future and the way. Encompass and enjoy your newly found masculinity but keep it in balance with your femininity for it is the real power.<br />
<br />
In this transformational process´ all of us will become bluntly aware of problems in our self-esteem, our relationships, finances´ health, jobs, and in every facet of our physical reality. No longer are we able to suppress or hide our old patterns of denial. The subjective (feminine) will surface, bringing with it the hidden and useless to be dealt with in the now, which is the cause of the great percentage of malcontent at this time. Pretending and illusion are over. The feminine ray is a transforming ray, offering love and acceptance of all things godly.<br />
<br />
3. TweIve major events will occur here on Earth between now and the time we enter the Photon Belt. They are designed to destroy or reform the old and archaic third-dimensional energies, which include you and me.<br />
<br />
Logic would indicate that one of these events would be the prosecution of the last and final war, most probably in the Middle East. This war will have a twofold objective: (1) to annihilate the old´ archaic male energies to make ready for the new and peaceful male, and (2) to facilitate into a position of leadership the new female energies.<br />
<br />
Following this, there will be an integration of these two energies to give birth to the new male and female consciousness which will be attendant to the incoming Christ energies, that is, the new embodiment of man and womankind.<br />
<br />
4. In order to cope with the speeding up and compression of time and space, our physical bodies must be rearranged and realigned in order to facilitate the incoming Christ consciousness. Some of these rearrangements will have to do with the key elements of the physical and etheric bodies. Expected are realignment of our current consciousness; realignment of the chakras (now seven) to twelve or thirteen; increasing the DNA strands from the current two to twelve or thirteen; balancing out the male and female energies in order to reach a state of androgyny; and acceleration of our atoms in consistency with the degree of the incoming light and consciousness. In addition, our pineal gland, now about the size of a pea, will return to its original size, about the size of a quarter. All receptors will be reawakened.<br />
<br />
All persons experiencing this will become clairvoyant, clairaudient, clairsentient, and more. Just as Jesus did, we will become great seers, healers, and prophets. This will serve us well in the near future. Now, of all times, we must turn our will over to the divine. In this statement there is a profound truth but also an inherent danger. Now, of all times, we must unequivocaliy qualify our intentions, making sure that our arrow of intention goes to the target intended. The divine must be couched in certainty with such statements as, for example, &quot;to the one and only creator God&quot;: &quot;to my higher consciousness&quot;; &quot;to Mother Mary&quot;; or, &quot;to the one and only Christ.&quot; Otherwise, any statement issued in the form of an affirmation will be immediately picked up by the darker forces and used against us and mankind. Remember: QUALIFY.<br />
<br />
Leave no doubts or uncertainties. Note that thoughts are energy, more real than our physical bodies; therefore they must be controlled and specifically directed.<br />
<br />
5. As our bodies and consciousness reform into the light, thought, not physical action, will become our menu of the day. In this new mode, &quot;etheric in reality&quot; thoughts are more real than physical action - what you think is what you are for that moment. Since we are in the consciousness of the fourth dimension, we are etheric and exposed to all. Each of us will be like a television screen, projecting our thoughts for all to see and hear. No longer can you hide malice´ avarice and greed, hate, lust, deceit, or dishonesty. The minute you think it, you become it. You become an open book, free of letters other than those you create for the moment which must be rectified instantaneously with love, light, and forgiveness if you are not to be subject to the inherent penalties and possible expulsion from the fourth dimension reality back to the third dimension. Third-dimensional frailties unequivocally will not be tolerated. Conversely, if we are truly and firmly ensconced in the light of the Christ and its Golden Age, then none of these aberrations should arise, and if they do, they must be dealt with quickly lest they become real and, as a result, banish us back to the third dimension. I wonder how many of us on the planet now have experienced this in the past.<br />
<br />
6. Our world of illusion and polarities will collapse. In due time, as we approach the null zone of the Photon Belt, these make-believe realities which have been thrust upon Us by those who put us here, will disintegrate, leaving us naked, vulnerable and exposed. This will represent the turning around of the mirror causing you and me to look at the true side of reality. For a moment, we are totally vulnerable, defenseless and confused. Nonetheless, it is at this moment that we must decide, do I want to give up the old and archaic, or do I want to step boldly into the light and regain that which has always been rightly mine, my Christhood? If we should choose the continuation of the old and archaic ways, we can expect another 10,500+ years of darkness.<br />
<br />
7. In the past our planet has flipped its solar axis more than 330 times.<br />
<br />
This was not happenstance but contrived by those who put us here as an ultimate control. Despite the intention of the forces of darkness to do it again, the Wormwood people will not succeed this time around.<br />
<br />
However, there will be a reversal of the magnetic poles from a clockwise rotation to a counterclockwise rotation which will speed up the rotation of the planet to degrees unimaginable at this time. As an explanation for this change in rotation, one will recall my stating earlier that our planet had been chosen to be the collector and transformer of all negative energies in our Solar System. To do this, our magnetic poles were rearranged in order to rotate in a clockwise direction, which was counter to its true and desired rotation.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, this alteration was necessary for us and our planet to serve as a collector vehicle for negativity. For 10,500 years we have performed in this extremely unstable reality, serving both individually and collectively as vehicles of transformation. Although extremely hazardous, we as the gods we are, chose to come here and master these volatile and suppressive energies. Without a doubt, our assignment is one of; if not the toughest in the Creators universe. Since we are nearing the Photon Belt and need to be in harmony with the rest of the Solar System, our magnetic pole reversal is a must.<br />
<br />
The question sometimes arises as to whether or not we as a planet will come back and do it again. Undoubtedly, we have in the past, but this time we will receive special dispensation and will not be requested to do so, for it would seem our planet has more than fulfilled its requirements for graduation into the higher realms. The planet will graduate, but will we individually? That, of course, is up to each one of us. Only in time will we know.<br />
<br />
Following this question is another most often asked: &quot;If our planet leaves our Solar System, what then happens to those souls who cannot make it at this time?&quot; For these unfortunates, there is another planet, a new planet Earth, currently residing in the fourth dimension (etheric); and it is to this planet that the unfortunates will go in disembodiment to experience a deep sleep and rest before being prepared and reconditioned to come to Earth again to experience another 10,500 years of darkness. It should be noted that as our current planet ascends into the fourth dimension, the alternate planet correspondingly will descend into the third dimension, thus replacing us as the new planet Earth.. (Please see drawing.) 8. As all of this phenomena associated with entering the Photon Belt increases and precipitates dramatic physical, emotional and spiritual changes among us, look for mass landings of friendly extraterrestrials who will arrive to assist the needy and the worthy to survive the apocalyptic changes ahead. Look for their arrival from late 1995 and early 1996 on. The year 1996 is predicted to be a horrendous year, expunging mass humanity consisting of those who will not or cannot accept the incoming Christ consciousness. This incoming consciousness will tolerate no nonsense or measure of resistance for the old and archaic must go to make room for the new. This includes government, science and religion. All aspects of our third-dimensional life must return to the light and divinity if it is to survive.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of the mass landings has to do with a declaration to World Government that &quot;we are here; we are in charge. We invite you to join us in the brotherhood of Man. If you do not, then you must suffer the ultimate consequences.&quot; One more adjunct to the foregoing: it is speculated that as we near the Photon Belt, tremendous radiation will be experienced. This radiation, which lies near the null zone, will be so disruptive that it undoubtedly will adversely affect the worldwide nuclear stockpiles and reactors. Should this happen, our planet would be totally annihilated and in the process derail the successful graduation of our planet and Solar System into the fourth dimension.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the mass landings, with their superior intelligence, will neutralize and / or dematerialize this monumental threat.<br />
<br />
9. As we approach the Photon Belt, look for frequent encounters with the angelic host. Perception of these exalted beings will become common for those who are in concert with the incoming Christ consciousness. Among these mighty angelic forces look for Lord Michael, our mentor and guardian, to make an appearance. He will, with dispatch and clarity, excise all that must be removed to create a new world and a new order.<br />
<br />
10. Look for the animal kingdom to assume near-human qualities and understanding, and well it should, for as we vacate our realms of previous understanding and assume our Godship, the animals will venture forth to fill the void, elevating them to near humanness. Concurrent with this, expect the nether world of the elementals and nature spirits to develop into humanness. They are at this time near human and entitled to assume their full humanness.<br />
<br />
11. Expect massive decreases in our magnetic fields (our gravity and our density). As we become light, these elements will hold little or no sway over us for they lose the quality of constraint.<br />
<br />
12. As Sheldon Nidel stated in his book, Becoming a Galactic Human Being, we will in the near future be expected to become fully conscious beings working with interdimensional energies and beings. Not only will this consciousness allow us to be integrated into the fourth dimension but will also afford us the opportunity to access parallel dimensions which lie 90 degrees from our present reality. How exciting! Maybe then those things that go &quot;bumpity bump&quot; in the night will take on form and shape.<br />
<br />
13. Expect to see avant-garde colors, shapes and sacred geometry configurations as we near the Photon Belt. Look for the skies to appear to be totally consumed by fire. Do not worry, however, as this phenomenon is a cold fire and will not harm you. It is merely a signal that we are approaching our final destiny, the Photon Belt and the consummate Christ consciousness! 14. As our personal and earthly realms of reality and understanding are transformed, so will the higher realms adjacent to us be transformed.<br />
<br />
Remember the Kabalistic axiom, &quot;as it is above, so shall it be below,&quot; and vice versa. One of the most spectacular and heralded events is the possible changing of our current Central Sun from its birth in the Pleiadian constellation to the constellation of Sirius. It would appear that the Sirian peoples are much more kindly disposed toward us than the Pleiadians. This portends colossal changes in the future of our Solar System.<br />
<br />
To return to the Pleiadians and a personal comment: in 1988 I had occasion to personally regress myseIf back to look at the ultimate sinking of that ancient continent Atlantis. Much to my dismay, I discovered an element of Pleiadian origin, and the then rulers of Atlantis were responsible for the catastrophic nuclear explosions which ultimately sank</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">Deary me, what have you been taking? The most important thing to remember about entering the photon belt, is that it is already supposed to have; happened already in 1996, now its happening or how about in 2012 (and people now link it with dates produced by titor and other hoaxers). Stinks to death if you ask me, which you are not, but lies if cast as broadly are you are claiming are dangerous! The photon belt could be true, who knows, a 1961 probe, lol, a ludicrous idea. Let us just see shall we. If in 2012 nothing has happened fine, if it has well, I have an open mind, but it's certainly not going to be in connection with ANY RELIGION WHAT SO EVER.<br />
<br />
The only admission about this proposed cycle is that it is a very good number, around 13500 years, which fits in too well with ice age-thawing and civilisations in general.<br />

so I'm REALLY scared of a Photon Belt.<br />
<br />
actually, you know I'm joking about that, but I am serious about that.  I would be much more scared of  the Kuiper belt than the Photon Belt.  who cares if a thousand billion photons hit you.  As opposed to one big huge piece of Rock.<br />

As I was typing this I had somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 trillion photons hit me.  (im at work there are lots of lights).</div>

Aliens on the other hand do, some where but, I believe (in favour of the overwhelming evidence) that they do not live amongst us and neither have they made contact with us. If they have 'been here' no one's going to know now with all the stupid hoax claims of aliens/UFO encounters.<br />

Creedo, I have now read enough of your posts to know you will be at the fore of discovering the truth behind time travel and other phenomena.<br />

		"articleBody": "EARTH HAS ENTERED THE PHOTON BELT !!!\n\nThe Photon Belt\n\nAn Article by Virgil Armstrong ©1995\n\nFrom: http:\/\/www.2012.com.au\/Photon_belt.html\n\nLately there has been much talk about the Photon Belt and the accompanying manasic radiation, both scientific terms for this spectacular coming event.\n\nScience first admitted knowledge of this phenomenon in 1962, 33 years ago! As for us, the public, awareness oft his event came much later, and sadly, only to a very small number of people.\n\nEven when I first heard of the Photon Belt, I was inclined, through ignorance, to give it little credence. In fact, my first reaction was, \"the ,Wu-Wu´s´ are at it again. They have invented a new wrinkle to make more money.\" This was almost a colossal mistake on my part, but Spirit had its way and notified me that it was real. Spirit also said I must understand the phenomenon and go forward to inform the world of the true realities of the Photon Belt.\n\nAt this point, I began to take this phenomenon seriously, and after considerable research and study, I was ready to step forward and begin speaking about the Photon Belt. I first introduced it to the public in Columbus, Ohio, in October 1994, followed immediately by an extensive speaking tour in Europe. Much to my surprise, the subject was enthusiastically received everywhere I went. The following is a discussion of the subject for you, the reader.\n\nThe Photon Belt and the manasic radiation have a greater impact than one might imagine. From the scientific point of view, it is the procession of our Solar System and its accompanying planets around the Central Sun, called Alcione, located in the constellation of Pleiades. This counter-clockwise cyclic procession around Alcione requires 25,860 years to make one complete orbit. Our present-day sun, moon, and planets must twice pass through the Photon Belt during this time, that is, once to the North and once to the South. (See diagram, below.) During this cycle, there are two periods of darkness and two periods of light. The periods of darkness, which constitute the vast majority of the rotation around the Central Sun, consist of two periods of 10,500 years each, plus an additional, seemingly optional 430 years for both of the 10,500-year periods. (i.e., 10,500+430 = 10,930 years, times 2=21,860 years).\n\nFollowing each period of 10,500 years of darkness, we then emerge into 2000 years of total light, which actually constitutes the Photon Belt. In review, we then have 21,860 years of darkness and 4,000 years of light (21,860 + 4,000 = 25,860 years, or one complete cycle\/orbit). Again, please refer to the diagram below.\n\nAnother way of viewing this phenomenon is that in one complete orbit, we have five sixths darkness and approximately one-sixth light, or a 5:1 ratio, with darkness being predominant. Surprisingly enough, we are now, as a Solar System and planet, once again emerging from 10,500+ years of darkness and preparing to merge into 2000 years of light, which we will begin to experience in the year 2000. The foregoing is a general scientific understanding of the Photon Belt phenomenon, but what about its spiritual significance? A question in your mind might be, \"Why does the darkness, or negative aspect, of our 26,OOO-yearjourney around the Central Sun predominate? Why not more light?\" As in all things in the Creators omni-universes, everything has divine purpose and reason. All aspects are in synchronicity with one another: the higher with the lower, the lower with the higher; or, to quote Kabalistic law, \"as it is above, so shall it be below; as it is below, so shall it be above.\" It is important to understand that divine law has intent and purpose. What I am about to relate spiritually will lend greater individual understanding and acceptance of what would otherwise appear to be punitive and unreasonable.\n\nThe reason we experience five-sixths more darkness in our journey around the Central Sun is because the divine powers, in concert with those of us who were chosen, agreed to create and experience a world of negativity (darkness), polarities, and illusion encrusted with fear, judgments, control, hate, greed, death, and much more. This was a contrived plan which facilitated the Creator´s desire to better understand the true nature of negativity, or its shadow self This explosive and unpredictable world, likened to a veritable mine field, is designed to test the mettle of all associated with this special planet, Planet Earth. We are the vehicle through which the divine can experience itself; and through our individual and collective experiences, can master the intricacies and dangers of darkness. We have been selectively chosen to come here.\n\nMany, upon hearing this, would venture to say this is insane, but nonetheless, it is true. We are unique, one of a kind. We are the chosen vehicle (planet) to collect, assimilate, and transform all negativity for our entire Solar System. We are the dumping ground and refuse holding area for the whole Solar System. Through our thoughts, actions, and reactions, we serve as transformers for all negativity being thrust upon us. What a task! So you see that what might be adjudged as something totally negative and uncalled for is, in truth, endowed with Spirit and its divine mission here on Earth. That mission is to experience through us the negativity for self and in the process, learn how to dispense with it more expeditiously and permanently, making all else a better place to live and work. So, you see, we and our planet are unique and special.\n\nUndoubtedly, the next question is, \"How does this relate to the Photon Belt?\" This is a complex question, but before getting into the intricacies of it, let us first establish that the Photon Belt and accompanying manasic radiation are in and of themselves vehicles of transformation and transmutation. They are the guardian barrier and vehicle to see that none of the negativity of Earth escapes and contaminates the higher levels of consciousness. Presiding over all of this is the Christ, and upon knowing this, we can quickly see that the Photon Belt and the manasic radiation are the eminence of the Christ and its christed energies. Unless we are in accord with these energies, as we approach and enter the Photon Belt, we cannot hope to be a part of it and escape the negative influences of Planet Earth.\n\nIn that sense, we would have to return to the third dimension and do it all over again. Ironic as it may seem, before each of us came to Planet Earth, we were fully aware of the inherent dangers of coming to Earth and living and experiencing its gross negativities. We were also informed that we could not escape the influence of negativity until we had mastered it, which, of course, was the divine intent all along, for how can the divine learn and experience self other than through us? Unfortunately some are slower learners than others, and it takes repeated turns around the wheel (the Central Sun) before the lesson is learned. Usually about one-third of the planet´s then total population is successful in each 10,500-year period.\n\nReflect on some of what I have said, such as \"you are chosen; you could not be here this time around without approval; and you cannot leave, even though you volunteered, until you have completely mastered negativity.\" Indeed, that is a big task but you will do it sooner or later. When you have accomplished this, the rewards on the other side are inestimable; and because you have mastered and graduated from this toughest of learning schools in the Creator´s domain, you will jump grades ahead of your contemporaries on the other side. So don´t despair for you are Gods in amnesia, and you are not destined to fail for long! Let´s return to the subject of the Christ and its relationship to the Photon Belt. The Christ and its energies are repeatedly mentioned in ancient texts, indicating that unless we can become one with these christed energies, we cannot hope to survive the coming calamities and pass through the Photon Belt. The Mayan prophecies clearly signal this in a profound statement which says, \"government, science and religion will collapse unless they are prepared to accept and facilitate the incoming Christ consciousness.\" Once again, this is an oblique reference to the Photon Belt and its christed energies (the manasic radiation). All things obsolete, archaic, and negative, including YOU, will break down in the face of the incoming Christ energies unless you and it will accept and live these sacred truths. The great avatar, Jesus, while on Earth made this abundantly clear when he said, \"1, through the Christ, shall separate the wheat from the tares, the sheep from the goats.\" Implied was that humanity, as it approaches the end days and the Photon Belt, will be divided into two camps, that is, those who can and will accept the incoming Christ consciousness (the wheat and the sheep), and those who will not or cannot (the tares and the goats). As we near the entrance into the Photon Belt, which will take place in or about the year 2000, all of this will become abundantly clear. Note that the year 2000 also marks our entrance into the fourth dimension as a peoples, planet, and consciousness. Be reminded that it is destined that our planet be assured safe passage into and through the Photon Belt. The only question is, will you and I receive the same accord? The answer is yes, only if we, too, can accept, accommodate, and act out the incoming Christ consciousness.\n\nIn quick review, I hope that I have impressed upon your mind that the Photon Belt is something far greater than astronomical or scientific postulates as to how the Solar System and its planets rotate around Alcione, our Central Sun, and how, in this process, our Solar System and planets experience 21,860 years of darkness and 4,000 years of light. I trust I have convinced you that the whole process is a profound sequential spiritual experience, dealing directly with the Christ consciousness.\n\nLet us now go into this spiritual experience more deeply. To begin with, the Photon Belt really is nothing new. In ancient history there are many references, particularly by the Greeks and Romans, to a Golden Age wherein there was nothing but light, love, peace and tranquility, a place where death, war, famine, disease, and poverty were unknown. These ancient philosophers were obviously alluding to the Photon Belt, that 2000-year period of light. Once again we are at that point where we are about to enter into this phenomenal period of light, the Golden Age of the past and the future. We are emerging from our oppressive cocoon of darkness and, like the butterfly, can emerge as something extremely beautiful, that is, our light bodies and our total communion with the Christ. That cocoon of darkness, despite its oppressiveness and negativity, has been our teaching and learning vehicle to qualify us once again to return from whence we came, the Photon Belt. We are again being offered the opportunity to break the fetters of this world of illusion to turn the mirror around, and in its place perceive our true reality. With this, the restraints of negativity, illusion, polarities, judgments, control, hate, avarice and greed, jealously, killings and war will all fall away. Our special Earth assignment, which has been to experience and master negativity and illusion, will be fulfilled, and we can go home where we rightly belong. As we approach the Photon Belt and its eminence, the manasic radiation, we will become aware of the Christ consciousness and the call to arms. The call to arms is a declaration by the Christ that we have been in darkness long enough and now it is time to go home into the light. In the final analysis, however, the choice is our though our free will. The going-home process is not as simple as it would first seem, for we must first experience a tremendous transformational process which will enable us to eliminate our negativity and assume our bodies of light. This, in turn, will catapult us out of the enslaving energies of the third dimension into the fourth and fifth dimensions - the Photon Belt.\n\nThis quantum leap into the future is not customary but is usually sequential in nature, encompassing one dimension at a time. However, due to our unexplained unwillingness to grow and mature with the dictates of the divine scenario, in contrast to the other planets, we must now play catch-up and attain the level of the other planets in order for the Solar System to remain in keeping with divine intent and scheduled advancement. We must finally be brought to terms in order to insure safe passage by the entire federation of planets into the Photon Belt. We have just a few years until the year 2000 to do this. This is not only the entrance into the Photon Belt but also the fourth dimension. By the year 2005, five years into the Photon Belt, we will have reached our ultimate objective, the fifth dimension! An interesting fact: the Lost Books of the Bible, that is, the original and unabridged version of our current Bible, states that \"The second coming of the Christ will occur in the year 2005.\" This then implies that we will witness and experience the second coming of the Christ only after we have attained the fifth dimension of consciousness. We will by then have long abandoned our bodies of density and will be wearing our garments of light, just as the Christ always has.\n\nBefore any of this can happen, we must first experience a complete transformational process here on Earth. Our planet, our bodies, and our consciousness all must achieve and resonate at a much higher and intense frequency in order to accommodate the incoming Christ consciousness. Let´s begin with one aspect of our planet´s transformation. Our present speed as we as a planet fly through space is estimated to be about 18,000 miles per hour. Consider then the speculation that upon entering the Photon Belt, we will have reached a speed of 208,000 miles per hour, or an increase of 190,000 miles per hour. One does not have to speculate very long to realize this tremendous acceleration will compress time and space into realms of realizations, incomprehensible at this time. What can be assumed is that all things mundane and corporeal in nature will undergo tremendous transformation in order to be in harmony with the compression and accelerated speed. Every cell in our body´ every molecule, every atom will be rearranged so as to (hopefully) transform our current bodies of density and morality into a vehicle of transformational light, capable of facilitating the incoming Christ consciousness and its immortality. It is also said that in the transformational process, our DNA system will be rearranged from a system of 2 strands to a system of 12 or 13 strands. Our chakras will also be rearranged and increased, going from 7 to 12 or 13. Our atoms will be increased and rearranged in order to facilitate the incoming light (Christ consciousness).\n\nFollowing through with the transformational theory, it seems reasonable that our beloved planet, a living organism, must also transform to receive the Christ consciousness. This procedure will emerge in the much heralded Earth changes, representing dissolution of the old and archaic illusionary concepts. Today there is much discussion and conjecture about the Earth changes and how they will affect us individually and collectively. For your information, the Earth changes have already begun in the form of recent earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and unpredictable and devastating weather patterns. To be honest, this is only the beginning and will become more intense and deadly, for how else can the purgation of the old and archaic be accomplished, whether it be the planet or the body? In the process nothing, I repeat, nothing will remain untouched. We can expect total chaos, dissolution, rearrangement and total destruction. Nothing, unless they or it are in harmony with the divine Christ consciousness, will be spared. Sadly enough, the Illuminati (secret government) as well as the world frontal governments, have discovered too late that their displacement to the Moon and Mars and inner Earth in order to avoid the coming Earth changes has been for naught because the Moon and Mars, as well as the other planets, must also reform in order to survive.\n\nThis escapism policy, which says, \"to hell with the multitudes and hurrah for us,\" must bear a heavy price, and I wish them well. In summary, I can only say that their celebrated egos have been dealt a mortal blow. I am sure, too, that this august body has alternatives in mind, such as riding out the catastrophic changes in their advanced space ships, but this will not succeed because the universal laws of retribution will prevail, and all things, large and small, must be held accountable. To explain further, unless all things mundane and physical are in harmony with the incoming Christ energies (fourth and fifth dimensions), they will, despite their most zealous attempts to escape the reality of these super energies, be consigned to failure. Hovering in space to escape the physical is no exception.\n\nPerhaps, in the dialog above, I have created an element of fear among you readers. This, of course, was not my intention, but it does serve a point.\n\nMass chaos and destruction, although present for the many, need not affect you personally. Repeatedly throughout these writings I have ventured that all will be spared if they will acknowledge the incoming Christ energies and strive to walk and talk in love, light, balance, and forgiveness. In the process you will be creating your new and wondrous body of light. As you, \"through the above,\" build your body of light´ you will be resistant and ultimately impervious to all physical and archaic laws. Remember that when you have a body of light, you are one with the Christ and the fourth dimension. Therefore, your physical being is not of density and matter, so how can you get hurt? Fear is food for the darker and negative forces and is the vehicle through which they have controlled Us over the millennia.\n\nWithout fear, they have no way to control us and so are impotent. Remember this when you most need it.\n\nWith this as an overview, I would now like to present in general some experiences which will occur upon entering the Photon Belt. Keep in mind that these are some of what may be expected. Many more will arise of which we are as yet unaware. Some of these have already been mentioned but are equally important with the rest.\n\n1. The Photon Belt and the manasic radiation are vehicles of transformation. The Photon Belt is the home of the Christ; the radiation is the emerging eminence of the Christ. Through these spiritual vehicles, provided we work with them, we are being given the opportunity to break the current restraints of bondage and go home from whence we originally came. However, the choice is ours. Free will will prevail.\n\n2. The new moon solar eclipse on November 3, 1994, along with its predecessor, the lunar eclipse of the sun in 1991, amplified the love of our Mother God. Along with everything else, our consciousness is being restructured to a state of balance wherein we will become equal parts of the feminine and masculine energies, just as Jesus did; we will become androgynous, that is, 50% male and 50% female. The emphasis is being placed on the feminine because the male energies are now discordant, archaic, and too fixed. Take a look around your world and see the insanity of man in Yugoslavia, Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Russia, and yes, even the United States. The feminine must transcend and transform these old male patterns before the christed energies can be balanced here on Earth. If we are to survive, look for the emergence of the soft male and the strong woman. Women, remember this! Your greatest and most sacred strength on Earth is your femininity; it is the future and the way. Encompass and enjoy your newly found masculinity but keep it in balance with your femininity for it is the real power.\n\nIn this transformational process´ all of us will become bluntly aware of problems in our self-esteem, our relationships, finances´ health, jobs, and in every facet of our physical reality. No longer are we able to suppress or hide our old patterns of denial. The subjective (feminine) will surface, bringing with it the hidden and useless to be dealt with in the now, which is the cause of the great percentage of malcontent at this time. Pretending and illusion are over. The feminine ray is a transforming ray, offering love and acceptance of all things godly.\n\n3. TweIve major events will occur here on Earth between now and the time we enter the Photon Belt. They are designed to destroy or reform the old and archaic third-dimensional energies, which include you and me.\n\nLogic would indicate that one of these events would be the prosecution of the last and final war, most probably in the Middle East. This war will have a twofold objective: (1) to annihilate the old´ archaic male energies to make ready for the new and peaceful male, and (2) to facilitate into a position of leadership the new female energies.\n\nFollowing this, there will be an integration of these two energies to give birth to the new male and female consciousness which will be attendant to the incoming Christ energies, that is, the new embodiment of man and womankind.\n\n4. In order to cope with the speeding up and compression of time and space, our physical bodies must be rearranged and realigned in order to facilitate the incoming Christ consciousness. Some of these rearrangements will have to do with the key elements of the physical and etheric bodies. Expected are realignment of our current consciousness; realignment of the chakras (now seven) to twelve or thirteen; increasing the DNA strands from the current two to twelve or thirteen; balancing out the male and female energies in order to reach a state of androgyny; and acceleration of our atoms in consistency with the degree of the incoming light and consciousness. In addition, our pineal gland, now about the size of a pea, will return to its original size, about the size of a quarter. All receptors will be reawakened.\n\nAll persons experiencing this will become clairvoyant, clairaudient, clairsentient, and more. Just as Jesus did, we will become great seers, healers, and prophets. This will serve us well in the near future. Now, of all times, we must turn our will over to the divine. In this statement there is a profound truth but also an inherent danger. Now, of all times, we must unequivocaliy qualify our intentions, making sure that our arrow of intention goes to the target intended. The divine must be couched in certainty with such statements as, for example, \"to the one and only creator God\": \"to my higher consciousness\"; \"to Mother Mary\"; or, \"to the one and only Christ.\" Otherwise, any statement issued in the form of an affirmation will be immediately picked up by the darker forces and used against us and mankind. Remember: QUALIFY.\n\nLeave no doubts or uncertainties. Note that thoughts are energy, more real than our physical bodies; therefore they must be controlled and specifically directed.\n\n5. As our bodies and consciousness reform into the light, thought, not physical action, will become our menu of the day. In this new mode, \"etheric in reality\" thoughts are more real than physical action - what you think is what you are for that moment. Since we are in the consciousness of the fourth dimension, we are etheric and exposed to all. Each of us will be like a television screen, projecting our thoughts for all to see and hear. No longer can you hide malice´ avarice and greed, hate, lust, deceit, or dishonesty. The minute you think it, you become it. You become an open book, free of letters other than those you create for the moment which must be rectified instantaneously with love, light, and forgiveness if you are not to be subject to the inherent penalties and possible expulsion from the fourth dimension reality back to the third dimension. Third-dimensional frailties unequivocally will not be tolerated. Conversely, if we are truly and firmly ensconced in the light of the Christ and its Golden Age, then none of these aberrations should arise, and if they do, they must be dealt with quickly lest they become real and, as a result, banish us back to the third dimension. I wonder how many of us on the planet now have experienced this in the past.\n\n6. Our world of illusion and polarities will collapse. In due time, as we approach the null zone of the Photon Belt, these make-believe realities which have been thrust upon Us by those who put us here, will disintegrate, leaving us naked, vulnerable and exposed. This will represent the turning around of the mirror causing you and me to look at the true side of reality. For a moment, we are totally vulnerable, defenseless and confused. Nonetheless, it is at this moment that we must decide, do I want to give up the old and archaic, or do I want to step boldly into the light and regain that which has always been rightly mine, my Christhood? If we should choose the continuation of the old and archaic ways, we can expect another 10,500+ years of darkness.\n\n7. In the past our planet has flipped its solar axis more than 330 times.\n\nThis was not happenstance but contrived by those who put us here as an ultimate control. Despite the intention of the forces of darkness to do it again, the Wormwood people will not succeed this time around.\n\nHowever, there will be a reversal of the magnetic poles from a clockwise rotation to a counterclockwise rotation which will speed up the rotation of the planet to degrees unimaginable at this time. As an explanation for this change in rotation, one will recall my stating earlier that our planet had been chosen to be the collector and transformer of all negative energies in our Solar System. To do this, our magnetic poles were rearranged in order to rotate in a clockwise direction, which was counter to its true and desired rotation.\n\nNonetheless, this alteration was necessary for us and our planet to serve as a collector vehicle for negativity. For 10,500 years we have performed in this extremely unstable reality, serving both individually and collectively as vehicles of transformation. Although extremely hazardous, we as the gods we are, chose to come here and master these volatile and suppressive energies. Without a doubt, our assignment is one of; if not the toughest in the Creators universe. Since we are nearing the Photon Belt and need to be in harmony with the rest of the Solar System, our magnetic pole reversal is a must.\n\nThe question sometimes arises as to whether or not we as a planet will come back and do it again. Undoubtedly, we have in the past, but this time we will receive special dispensation and will not be requested to do so, for it would seem our planet has more than fulfilled its requirements for graduation into the higher realms. The planet will graduate, but will we individually? That, of course, is up to each one of us. Only in time will we know.\n\nFollowing this question is another most often asked: \"If our planet leaves our Solar System, what then happens to those souls who cannot make it at this time?\" For these unfortunates, there is another planet, a new planet Earth, currently residing in the fourth dimension (etheric); and it is to this planet that the unfortunates will go in disembodiment to experience a deep sleep and rest before being prepared and reconditioned to come to Earth again to experience another 10,500 years of darkness. It should be noted that as our current planet ascends into the fourth dimension, the alternate planet correspondingly will descend into the third dimension, thus replacing us as the new planet Earth.. (Please see drawing.) 8. As all of this phenomena associated with entering the Photon Belt increases and precipitates dramatic physical, emotional and spiritual changes among us, look for mass landings of friendly extraterrestrials who will arrive to assist the needy and the worthy to survive the apocalyptic changes ahead. Look for their arrival from late 1995 and early 1996 on. The year 1996 is predicted to be a horrendous year, expunging mass humanity consisting of those who will not or cannot accept the incoming Christ consciousness. This incoming consciousness will tolerate no nonsense or measure of resistance for the old and archaic must go to make room for the new. This includes government, science and religion. All aspects of our third-dimensional life must return to the light and divinity if it is to survive.\n\nAnother aspect of the mass landings has to do with a declaration to World Government that \"we are here; we are in charge. We invite you to join us in the brotherhood of Man. If you do not, then you must suffer the ultimate consequences.\" One more adjunct to the foregoing: it is speculated that as we near the Photon Belt, tremendous radiation will be experienced. This radiation, which lies near the null zone, will be so disruptive that it undoubtedly will adversely affect the worldwide nuclear stockpiles and reactors. Should this happen, our planet would be totally annihilated and in the process derail the successful graduation of our planet and Solar System into the fourth dimension.\n\nTherefore, the mass landings, with their superior intelligence, will neutralize and \/ or dematerialize this monumental threat.\n\n9. As we approach the Photon Belt, look for frequent encounters with the angelic host. Perception of these exalted beings will become common for those who are in concert with the incoming Christ consciousness. Among these mighty angelic forces look for Lord Michael, our mentor and guardian, to make an appearance. He will, with dispatch and clarity, excise all that must be removed to create a new world and a new order.\n\n10. Look for the animal kingdom to assume near-human qualities and understanding, and well it should, for as we vacate our realms of previous understanding and assume our Godship, the animals will venture forth to fill the void, elevating them to near humanness. Concurrent with this, expect the nether world of the elementals and nature spirits to develop into humanness. They are at this time near human and entitled to assume their full humanness.\n\n11. Expect massive decreases in our magnetic fields (our gravity and our density). As we become light, these elements will hold little or no sway over us for they lose the quality of constraint.\n\n12. As Sheldon Nidel stated in his book, Becoming a Galactic Human Being, we will in the near future be expected to become fully conscious beings working with interdimensional energies and beings. Not only will this consciousness allow us to be integrated into the fourth dimension but will also afford us the opportunity to access parallel dimensions which lie 90 degrees from our present reality. How exciting! Maybe then those things that go \"bumpity bump\" in the night will take on form and shape.\n\n13. Expect to see avant-garde colors, shapes and sacred geometry configurations as we near the Photon Belt. Look for the skies to appear to be totally consumed by fire. Do not worry, however, as this phenomenon is a cold fire and will not harm you. It is merely a signal that we are approaching our final destiny, the Photon Belt and the consummate Christ consciousness! 14. As our personal and earthly realms of reality and understanding are transformed, so will the higher realms adjacent to us be transformed.\n\nRemember the Kabalistic axiom, \"as it is above, so shall it be below,\" and vice versa. One of the most spectacular and heralded events is the possible changing of our current Central Sun from its birth in the Pleiadian constellation to the constellation of Sirius. It would appear that the Sirian peoples are much more kindly disposed toward us than the Pleiadians. This portends colossal changes in the future of our Solar System.\n\nTo return to the Pleiadians and a personal comment: in 1988 I had occasion to personally regress myseIf back to look at the ultimate sinking of that ancient continent Atlantis. Much to my dismay, I discovered an element of Pleiadian origin, and the then rulers of Atlantis were responsible for the catastrophic nuclear explosions which ultimately sank",
