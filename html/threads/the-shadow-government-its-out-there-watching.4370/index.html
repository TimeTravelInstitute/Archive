<br />
The Shadow Government... Its out there... Watching You...<br />
<br />
Intro<br />
<br />
In the closing months of the Eisenhower administration.  Ike created an agency.  An agency that has no intials.  An agency that has 'special' employees.  An agency that has super surveillance technology that allows to watch people anywhere on earth and listen.  It has independent funding sources.  It is hidden from other agencies and is unkown to Congress and the President.<br />
<br />
Ike instructed his new agency to watch and wait for the time when corporations and the government would unite against the people. And then strike. By telling Americans about the truth. Truth about secret societies and corporate boards all intermingled. People who want to start a oppressive one world government. People who want to depopulate the world and start over instead of leaving and going to the stars with technology being hoarded by our military. They were told to protect America at all costs. <br />
<br />
Ike was told their 'evil' plans. And he rejected it.  He didn't just warn Americans<br />
<br />
He took steps to protect America...<br />
<br />
Some call it the 'Shadow Government'...<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>The Shadow Government...</b><br />
<br />
It's a day like any other day in the late 1980's....<br />
<br />
A fall day crisp and clean...<br />
<br />
Sean Kelson is on his way to work. Not his usual way on the Ferry from Jersey City.  He is talking the PATH Train to his new job.  He was a &quot;big shot&quot; once.  But things happened and he had to start all over.  He crowds on to the platform at Exchange Place Centre.  After going down the long stairway esculator.  It's long very long.  He's wonders if he is going to see Claire.  He used to commute with her on the ferry.  But he knows she doesn't go to work at this time.  But 7:00am in the morning, in her pink pencil skirt business suit.  He's heartbroken.  He's lost his opportunity to pursue her and make her his wife and mother of his children.  Childhood friends they were.. She was his &quot;Pizza Delivery Girl&quot; for Domino's Pizza for years and years in high school.  They didn't see each much in high school.  But she did stop by when he was BMX Bicycling in the schoolyard.  She was a blond with long hair.  A white yellow blond.  Her Polish mother genes gave it her.  And her fathers faired brown hair genes didn't stand in the way.  He was Scotland.  But he might have been scotch-irish.  A tall man 6'2 wide shoulders and thin build.  He's in his 70's now.<br />
<br />
He waits on the platform as people hurried and stone faced pass by.  His time is short.  The falling out with Claire and his father's immiment death are on his mind.  He notices a pretty redhead kind of looks like Annette Being on the subway.  She smiles as stands near him.  She's looks like she has one a few beauty pagents but almost all Wall Street go getter &quot;tiger women&quot; look like.  The &quot;Corporate Tiger Women&quot; are the female yuppies in business suits taking over Wall Street.  There are less and less men in analyst, technology, sales and management every year.  They are attractive but difficult to deal with.  A &quot;woman scorned&quot; can kill your career.<br />
<br />
The train comes and they squeeze like sardines.  There are no &quot;pushers&quot; like the Subway in Japan where he spent his college days.  He has a degree in Computer Science from Tokyo University.  He did 2 years at NYU and the 2 year in Japan.  He misses Japan.  The women.  The society.  Japan's polite society fits him.  They say little, have respect one another and family.  And take their loyalties to the companies very seriously.  They never talk badly about their boss.  If only Americans could keep their mouths shut be polite and behave, it would be a bad country.  But its a hell hole, much different than the TV and Movie Industy would let you believe.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a group of suits gather in a private clubhouse bar in Grand Central Station.  Serious men and women in the 50s', 60s and some other ages here and there but they blend in with the crowd.  They beggining a meeting.  A serious meeting.  Men with mirrored sun glasses and &quot;Secret Service&quot; earplugs are on guard inside and outside the station.  A Vice Presidential visit is used as a cover.  The white haired oldest man starts the meeting.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Do we have any candidates?&quot; he begins.  <br />
<br />
A woman called with the codename DELTA says &quot;A few...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go through them one by one...&quot; the name to be known as ALPHA says...<br />
<br />
Delta expands &quot;Here is Connolly... He's bright but too small really for hand to hand&quot;<br />
<br />
BETA an attractive women in her 40's says &quot;He's friends with the target... Some &quot;nationality group&quot; or something. We have to reject him and isolate him&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA &quot;Unfortunate.  We thought he could help.  Anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
DELTA moves to the next canidate &quot;Here's McCaufield... He's great but in love with himself... Women won't like after awhile... It'a all about them these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA ask &quot;What about the computer guy... Is he just a nerd? His work is fascinating...&quot;<br />
<br />
BETA says &quot;You don't Know?!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
DELTA cuts BETA off &quot;Don't interupt.  He's not what he appears... We did some background in his hometown.  He's seems to multi-identities... We are perplexed but studying him closely&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA says &quot;What do you mean? Multi-personalities?...&quot;<br />
<br />
BETA cuts in again &quot;No. He's not &quot;crazy&quot;... He's leading double triple quadruple lives... Like a spy&quot;<br />
<br />
THETA interjects &quot;Your kidding me... What is he is doing? Exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
DELTA says &quot;He's a surfer guy.  He's surfs in the summer.  Talks and acts like a surfer.   He's a biker guy.  Wears leather jackets t-shirts and boots in the winter.  Hangs out in biker bars playin pool.  And get this?... He's better than Willie Mosconi or Machine Gun Merserak.  He's a computer software engineer at college and work.  And play the part.  He's got no New York City accent.  Speaks perfect english.  But talk like a surfer and/or biker in his hometown.  But sounds looks and acts like a &quot;corporate vp&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA says &quot;Sounds promising...&quot;<br />
<br />
BETA adds &quot;It gets better... He's not bad with the ladies...&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA angrily cuts in &quot;You didn't meet him in person did you? Did you sleep with him?!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
DELTA says &quot;No. We just talked to him alittle at the bar... He's quite charming.  He picked up without talking to us... It was a... impressive...&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA wonders &quot;How?...&quot; curiously.<br />
<br />
DELTA explains &quot;He's a psychology minor and expert in body language as well as a sociologist.  He's been developing profiles on people for over 20 years even before college...&quot;<br />
<br />
BETA &quot;He makes eye contact and then makes small talk and then &quot;charmed the panties off us...&quot;<br />
<br />
DELTA sits back and laughs and cautions &quot;We didn't sleep with him but we haven't stopped talking about him since...&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA &quot;A pick up artist?...&quot;<br />
<br />
BETA &quot;Not exactly.  He was really actually interested in us.  Asked the most amazing questions about our supposed work lives and was just a little curious about our private lives...&quot;<br />
<br />
GAMMA jumps in &quot;We have had field agents observing him for 10 years... We have some exciting news&quot;<br />
<br />
GAMMA continues &quot;He's a self defense expert.  Can handle him fairly well...&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA &quot;Do you test him or do background?...&quot;<br />
<br />
GAMMA explains carefully &quot;We.. Ah.. Sent some agents in 1 and 2 and 3's to fight him.  They all lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA says &quot;All lost?... Special Forces guys lost to a kid?...&quot;<br />
<br />
GAMMA seriously yeilds &quot;YES. ALL AT THE SAME TIME...&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA asks &quot;How is that possible?...&quot;<br />
<br />
GAMMA goes on &quot;He's a student of asia culture and the martial arts and a boxing fan.  Loves Muhammed Ali, Mike Tyson, Boom Boom Macini and others... Bruce Lee too.  Thinks he was killed for his &quot;martial arts&quot; philosophy and new approach.  He's had Akido as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA excitedly asks &quot;A black belt?...&quot;<br />
<br />
GAMMA answers amused &quot;No.  A white belt&quot; and laughs.<br />
<br />
ALPHA angrily inquiries &quot;How does a white belt defeat 3 special forces undercover evaluators?...&quot;<br />
<br />
GAMMA blurts out &quot;He's a Zen Buddhist... He's church threw him because he didn't donate money...&quot; laughing.  &quot;He decided to become a Shaolin Monk because of the David Caradine Kung Fu Series... He's seen all the &quot;temple&quot; scenes 50 times or something.  His family makes jokes about it from the wiretaps.  And he mediates.  He goes &quot;OHMMMMM OHMMMM&quot; all the time.  He's kind of funny after you get to know him...&quot; <br />
<br />
ALPHA say &quot;I think we have our man. Let's vote?&quot;<br />
<br />
This &quot;mysterious group or committee&quot; uses their cell phones and dail numbers all different at the same time.  They wait patiently as for answer.  From the earpiece comes a sound, &quot;AFFIRMATIVE. 100% PROBABLITY.  COVERT RECRUITED SUGGESTED.  APPROACH WITH CAUTION.  SMARTER THAN YOU.&quot; from a computer synethic voice.<br />
<br />
ALPHA put down his phone &quot;It seems this was more on an introduction than a selection process...&quot;<br />
<br />
DELTA &quot;I'll work him... &quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA announces &quot;OPERATION THOR'S HAMMER has been AUTHORIZED.  FUNDING WILL BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR YOUR UNITS.&quot;<br />
<br />
ALPHA says &quot;Let's get out of here... Before Gore comes in for the real meeting and eat's all the donuts... If he finds out we are not &quot;really democrats&quot; or &quot;secret service&quot;, he'll have us shot.&quot;<br />

<br />
Sean Kelson scans the platform for Claire... He sees her sometimes with her sister... Laura.  Laura a little strange.  See wears a french beret and slacks.  He wonders if she is gay like Katherine Hepburn but she seems nice.  He misses them.  But he knows their paths have moved forked and probably won't be seen much of them again.  He always wonders about the guys he sees Claire talking to sometimes while commutting.  One is a powerful wall street trader.  A Gorden Geecko type he Sean believes is a sociopath.  He has a famous quote in town attributed to him &quot;I don't make mistakes...&quot; yelling angrily at bosses, customers and coworkers.  <br />
<br />
Sean is down.  He quit his last job.  He wonders if he did the right thing.  He found some interesting stuff regarding one of the technology venders he was working with... The more and more he looked at the system.  He realized something odd going on... And they seemed to a babysitter or spy of sorts.  Who sit over his shoulder as he designed the system.  A bigshot from California.  An attractive women mind you.  A Marilyn Monroe type with red hairs and lots of curves.  She claimed to be jewish but married a gentile.  Named LeClare.  He did really believe her mind you.  He played dumb as much as possible.  He was in feud with his obnoxious boss.  Also Jewish.  He claimed he couldn't build and deliver the system in time.  Sean uped the stakes.  He said he deliver it tomorrow to just to annoy his boss.  If he lost, he couldn't work on the project.  A strange bet in office on Wall Street.  Sean started coding and cutting and pasting all night long with his California monitor over his shoulder.  He structured and coded it so it could be read and understood by any decent programmer.  Structured code and naming conventions for objects and variables.  It designed a workflow distrubtion system that calculated the incoming documents, qued them and distributed the work to the staff.  It also allowed you to define the number of workers and their ids who were available to work.  It did exist anywhere before...  He talked to his &quot;babe from California&quot; Ms. Judy Richtenberg... It was light in the morning between 3:00am and 9:00am the next morning.  She revealed alot of information about her self and company and the market of the computer system - Digitized Document Imaging for Paperless Offices.  He was even more concerned when it was time to review the sytem with boss.  He couldn't wait for the system review and acceptance test.  By 9:00am there were thousands of lines of code in perferct structured form.  Even he was impressed at this self effort.  He really really didn't like boss.  Quite obnoxious individual with a Degree in Psychology not accounting, or finance or busines.  Sean wondered why he was there in the first place. But his boss had a MBA from Columbia or Wharton or somewhere. But his boss didn't know, Sean also considered a degree in Psychology.  Clinical Psychology.  Had many psychology courses in college considered a career as a psycho-therapist but passed because he didn't want to hear everone's secrets and problems.  Why have that burden in life... It's daunting to some.  He realizes their was some very very strange going on... Now he is off to a help desk job configuring computers installing networks and installing software... It's a bummer.<br />

<br />
Sean starts his day... Meeting up with his new partner in Software Support and Installation for the Help desk in FIERCE MELMAN NATIONAL EXPRESS.  His new boss, Tom Wilson is nice enough.  Laid back and relaxed.  A little different than the pomous elites of his former employers.  People from Yale, Havard, Wharton, Columbia, Princeton, The PAC 10 Football Colleges, The Ivy League Schools, The Seven Sisters and St. Peter's College.  He is kindo of looking for to it.  His partner is &quot;quite the babe&quot;.  A young woman who could have been in movies or tv if she knew the &quot;right people&quot;.  She seems to be like Sean.  Relaxed and not a elitest New York on Manhattan Island.  Everyone in the suburbs knows that the Manhatanites aren't really from New York or New Jersey but Europe and all across America.  Lot's of &quot;english guys&quot; with &quot;upper crust posh&quot; accents schmoozing the rich elite girls who move to the city for fame, fortune and CEO Husbands.  He and Susan start the day and make the rounds in the company.  It has a few offices in the area.  It's Tribeca and Lower Manhattan.  But they close and not a pick deal.  They even have a shuttle service between the buildings.  He has to turn away and grin to himself as she crawls under the desk in her pencil skirt and high heels to installation coaxial cable for networking connections to personal computer networks.  She has an amazing body and a face to die for...  A personality that anyone could love...  They make small talk.  He's new.  He doesn't want to be too nosey or reveal to much... But she seems single.  But he has to holdback because of the endless reports of sexual harrassment in the news on Wall Street and major corporations.  <br />
<br />
At his old job, his buddies who were managers would tell old &quot;war stories&quot; about how reviews were conducted with women and male managers.  Stories that couldn't make it into R movies... It would have to X-Rated.  But these guys were &quot;sad&quot; because the era of sexual extortion for good reviews on Wall Street were over... They missed the old days.... Sean was kinda of &quot;horried&quot; but interested in how the corporate world worked... And would &quot;Wow... That's wild stuff..&quot; but nothing more... And things like &quot;It was really like that over here...&quot;.  He knows how the real world works.  But its a tightrope.  One word to the wrong woman and its &quot;career overtime&quot;.  A lawsuit is grounds for termination.  You can only say &quot;Hi.. &quot; and smile to woman and you should have some business connection to her in the company if you are going to engage her conversation.  <br />
<br />
At one installation he can't contain himself, he grins and grins.  He interviewed the one of the acquired companies and they turned him turn for a &quot;gap&quot; on his resume.  Gaps on your resume are serious and become &quot;career enders&quot;.  Some HR managers, mostly all women or gay men, believe that any &quot;gap&quot; means your an &quot;employment risk&quot; or &quot;disgruntled employee&quot; type.  It's a widely held believe that doesn't account for real life issues such as abusive managers or discovers of serious crimes by corporations.  People who quit because they discover &quot;illegal activity&quot;.  Rare but it happens.  He thinks to himself &quot;So... I was NEVER going to work here... Huh?!!!&quot; and laughs but says nothing.  The headhunter told him the HR Manager from the new acquired company said &quot;Once I found it he quit his job... The interview was over&quot; despite his impressive resume of skills and accomplishments.  It meant nothing to her.  These HR managers don't want to take &quot;risk&quot; on a &quot;bad employee&quot;.  They are the &quot;Gate Keepers of Corporate America&quot; as Sean refers to them.  He doesn't mean it in a &quot;good way...&quot;  He thinks &quot;Women control Corporate America... &quot; and later thinks &quot;God Help Us...&quot; But he enjoys his day... Spending time with his new techie partner is kind of of a fun relief from the special project work and software engineering he used to do... Sometimes 50-60 hours a week.  It's fun stuff... Installing software, configuring machines Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files.  Installing networking software to access file servers in the early days of interlinked computing.  You could only read a file off a shared directory server.  Like the internet days but disguised with their Mosiac, Microsoft IE, Safari and Mozilla browsers of the 1990s and today.<br />
<br />
But his is not alone.  He has a friend ironically that works there.  Bob James.  He and Bob are friendly he knows him from his high school and college days.  He was a friend of his brother.  They might to commute home.  On night home, he goes to past a bar down Greenich Street in Tribeca.  He says Kevin Quincy hangs out there.  Sean says &quot;What is Kevin Quincy doing hanging out in a &quot;shot and beer&quot; bar in Tribeca?... Why isn't he uptown partying the night away...&quot; Bob says &quot;You got me... I just heard he is there all the time now...&quot; Sean thinks it strange.  Kevin Quincy is a &quot;super rich&quot; trader on Wall Street with tons of &quot;Broker Babes&quot; to play with... Hanging in a bar like a New York based Blarney Stone seems &quot;strange...&quot;<br />

Sean and Bob walk down Greenich Street toward the Wall Trade Center.  Tribeca is a unique compact neighborhood in Manhattan.  Tribeca really is only West of Broadway in downtown Manhattan in the Triangle Below Canal.  They pass Tommy Tang's the new &quot;cool&quot; celebrity restaurant in the area.  He makes the Entertainment shows like Access Hollywood.  Tribeca has become a &quot;secret celebrity&quot; zone in Manhattan.  Almost no one knows about it and it is little mentioned in the 1980s.  As they pass a large double tower high net worth residential tower.  <br />
<br />
Sean says to Bob &quot;Hey... That's Letterman's apartment complex...&quot; and points to the double tower.<br />
<br />
Bob replies... &quot;Your kidding me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean explains &quot;Yeah... He passed me in a cab on the West Side Highway jogging...  Can you beleive that?...&quot; he extorts laughingly...<br />
<br />
Bob laughs &quot;That's wild... Did you say anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean replies &quot;Yes.... I scream out of the window... 'I'v been a fan since the early 1950's' he chuckles...<br />
<br />
Bob asks &quot;What does that mean...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean reveals &quot;It is a &quot;code phrase&quot; from the The Late Show with David Letterman on NBC... Only &quot;real fans&quot; know it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob inquires &quot;What is he doing down here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;I guess its a quite neighborhood no one knows about... What's going to happen? He's going to mobbed by Yuppies and Traders for autographs?&quot; he laughs...<br />
<br />
Bob laughs &quot;I guess your right...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;That bar / restaurant across from the office is owned by Robert DeNiro...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob argues &quot;That's ridiculous... What would Robert DeNiro be doing owning a restaurant in Tribeca?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean say &quot;I'm surprised Kevin Quincy isn't hanging out there with all his money not the Blarney Stone down the block...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob goes on &quot;You put a guy on Wall Street but I guess you can't take the Peninsula City out of the guy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Did you hear that his buddy Timmy Mills... Was fired for being too foul mouthed and obnoxious on Wall Street...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob ask &quot;Really...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean laughs and says &quot;Yeah... I never liked that guy...&quot;<br />
<br />
They pass Tower Number 7 and to the entrance of the north lobby of World Trade Center to enter the mall and get to the PATH trains back to New Jersey. They pass the watch dealers and Charles Schwaab and the bank next door.  And head down the famous esculators to the PATH Platform.  The crowd is a throng of thousands as they meld together.  Yuppies, Techies, Accountants, Bond Salesmen, Traders and Broker Babes heading back to New Jersey for the night before the begin the rat race again the next day.  As they approach the bottom of the esculator Sean notices Claire standing there looking up at the approaching crowd at the bottom of the platform.  Claire is in her pink business suit and high heels looking like a &quot;mini&quot; Michele Pfiefer office &quot;eye candy&quot;.  Blonde hair dyed with Hydroden Peroxide instead of the reddish brown hair of her youth when Sean and her were friends.  Apparently she is waiting from her sister or a commuting buddy.  She looks out the corner of her eye but doesn't to say hi or wave.  Sean and Bob move past her on the right and the crowd splits for either PATH platform.  No one seems to crowd her or approach even close to her.  Sean finds this &quot;strange&quot;.   Sean notices the bar on the right.  It is a somewhat of a dive bar but its business people getting a drink or two to let the crowds go and make a later commute.  They go throught the turnstiles and down the stairs to the main platform.<br />
<br />
Sean asks Bob &quot;Did you see Claire at the bottom?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob says &quot;Yeah... And she didn't say hello...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;No.  We not 'friends' anymore...&quot; and grins...<br />
<br />
Bob asks &quot;Does that bother you?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;No. Her husband Jimmy and her I think set me up... I'll see her again... Someday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob complains &quot;Your paranoid.  They didn't set up at that bar...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Don't you know?... He kipnapped me from the bar and wouldn't drive me home... He was supposed to drive me straight home.  And then kept arguing with that guy until I came out the car 3 times until something really bad happened... Besides insisting on buying 5 shots of Jack Daniels... I knew he was up to something... I shouldn't have played along...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob says &quot;You should forget about that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;I'm incapable of forgetting....&quot;<br />
<br />
The train arrives with &quot;door bells&quot; ringing... PATH Trains have annoying endless bells that ring when the doors open and close.  They get on the train and head to New Jersey.  The train is crowed as heads through the tunnel like a roller coaster on a amusement park ride.  It takes 10 mintues to get to New Jersey and they get off the Echange Place platform.  And fight the crowd to head up the &quot;neo architecture&quot; esculators of Exchange Place PATH Station.  The strange lights make you think of a hidden high tech world.  <br />
<br />
Sean thinks &quot;Down one set of esculators and then up another... The fun never ends... The Rat Race.. I have to move to California before I get too old... The 101 and the 405 have to be better than this or a place in Venice Beach, Huntington Beach or Malibu...&quot;<br />
<br />
He continues in his head while commutting with Bob &quot;The Rat Race... At the end of the race... You'll still a rat...&quot;<br />
<br />
He notices all the &quot;corporate tiger women&quot; in the crowd that catch his eye with the tight business suit, 3 inch heels and sheer white blouses... And smiles... And thinks &quot;Maybe I'll find a good one someday...&quot;<br />
<br />
They get to the top of esculators.  And head to the street from the PATH train station entrance.  They are commuting separately.  <br />
<br />
Sean asks &quot;Do you want to go for Happy Hour?...&quot; <br />
<br />
Bob replies &quot;No. I'm heading to home then to work at Anthony's Sports Bar...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean asks &quot;Why do you bartend there?... Working with those italians guys in the bar...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob responds &quot;I like them...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;I don't know about Bob sometimes hanging with those guys... I think you might regret it someday...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob inquires &quot;Why?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean &quot;Bob... Come on... you must be kidding me... It's a Mob Bar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean continues &quot;Well I'm heading to the Union Bar... have fun with the I-Talians... Don't get whacked out or anything...&quot; and laughs...<br />
<br />
Bob says &quot;Later...&quot;  <br />

<br />
Sean makes his way across the plaza of Exchange Place in Jersey City, N.J. 07002.  The cobble stone square is wide and open with Union Square bar in a notch of the Colgate-Palmalovi office building.  It's an old wooden bar out of place with the large stone mason building of the across from the Harborside Financial Center.  Harborside was a giant warehouse on the waterfront converted into a modern office complex.  A white facade interlaced with office windows.  Sean looks over and smiles as he sees his old office at LENDERS TRUST COMPANY.  He had a window office over looking Exchange Place.  He thinks of his time there as he stops and smokes the last of cigarette in front the Union bar.  And he thinks... &quot;Why did I ever leave that place... What a mistake... My career is shattered and gone...&quot; but they are fond memories of his days... In his wallet are old business cards of the companies he has worked for...  He got offer a job there 3 years before he graduated college at St. Malachy's College up the street near Journal Square in Jersey City.  He flicks his cigarrete on the ground and steps on it.  He dressed in a tailored double breasted suit fitted to his athletic frame.  His shoulders are large and his chest is deep.  The suit hiddens the fact.  He always wears a white shirt and redish blue tie.  His hair brushed back and blowed dried disquising his old curly haired look.  And wearing his horned rimmed glasses.  He takes the glasses off before heading into the doorway of the bar.<br />
<br />
Sean Daly is a regulary of the Union Bar.  He enters quietly and goes to his stop at the east of the bar around the the corner of the L shaped bar.  <br />
<br />
He thinks to himself... &quot;Time to take the Norm position...&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks around as he sits down... The bar is empty... A wall bar with a mirror across the bar. Like any bar, he lined with bottles of alchohol of all kinds as if they are books on library shelf.  He waits for Ray The Bartender to come over with his drink.  Scotch on The Rocks.  2 cubes and 2 fingers of single malt scotch.  He looks around and see no regulars.  Their are a couple of patrons in the booths and at the far end of the bar.  He wonders where the regulars are... Sophia Queen and Partners.. An almost entirely female data processing company who frequents the bar.  Sophia is making a killing in the audit business processing financial records.  A local celebrity who has a hot small firm.  And Gene and Dan... Accountants from the neighborhood.  Fay and Mick... A close &quot;disguised couple&quot; from different firms.  Fay is a really hot number.  He loves to see her there.  Sexy and beautiful like a movie star with a funny sense of humor.  She love to talk about handcuffs.  He smiles when he thinks of her.  Mick works with an &quot;old high school&quot; flame of sorts.  They talk about Eileen often but she is married now and never comes into the bar.<br />
<br />
Ray finally comes over after to talking Ricky the son of the bar owner.  He manages it for his mother.  A bearded man who works for his mom.  Sean often wonders about him and what the truth is. <br />
Ray The Bartender brings over the drink and starts to talk.  <br />
<br />
Rays asks &quot;What's going on?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean replies &quot;Not much... Where is everybody?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray answers &quot;Don't know... It's still early...&quot;<br />
<br />
As they talk 2 women in their 40s enter the bar.  1 women is very attractive a Brunette with a shapely body and a fitted women's business suit.  Her friend is a blonde.  A little nerdy and not a classic beauty with black thick glasses.  They sit across from Sean a few seats away.  They look briefly but do not stare at him.  Ray goes to get their order.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies... What will you have...&quot; Ray inquires.<br />
<br />
The Brunnette says &quot;A manhattan...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Blonde says &quot;A white wine spritzer...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray says &quot;Can I interest you in Sean...&quot; and motions towards Sean and laughs and walks away...<br />
<br />
The Brunnette says &quot;His joking right?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean replies &quot;Yes.  Ray is having some fun with you...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Brunette asks &quot;So is this a good place?...  I was just transferred here from Chicago...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean responds &quot;It's a business bar really... Only a few locals come... And their from the neighborhood really... It's going yuppie... I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Brunnette asks &quot;So what business are around here?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Mostly banks and insurance... A few small companies in Harborside... I don't really know what they do... And few other firms like data processing companies...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Brunette introduces herself &quot;I'm Terry... And this is Nora...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean waves hi tersely and says &quot;I'm Sean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry says &quot;Nice to meet you Sean... Are you a regular...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Yes.  I stop in for a few before I go home...&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry says &quot;I see...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nora asks &quot;What do you do?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;I'm work for a brokerage comopany in... technology...&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry asks &quot;What company?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;A company in Manhattan...&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry asks &quot;Which one...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean makes the old joke &quot;If I told you... I'd have to kill you...&quot; and laughs<br />
<br />
Nora says &quot;You won't tell us?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean responds &quot;Well Ladies... I just met you... Why should I give you my life story in a bar... You could be &quot;evil corporate spies&quot;... and laughs<br />
<br />
Nora shocked &quot;Corporate Spies?... Are you serious.  We are in insurance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;So you claim...&quot; and grins.  Sean is having fun with the new patrons at the bar.<br />
<br />
Terry asks &quot;So where do you live? Is it around here?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean shocked answers &quot;Now you want to know where I live?.. Huh... I see&quot; and starts to get annoyed.<br />
<br />
Terry prodes &quot;Is it close? around here&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean throws her a bone &quot;No. It not really close.  This place is the first stop in New Jersey from the city...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nora mad says &quot;We just want to know... So we don't move there...&quot; and looks away.<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Well... Downtown Jersey City will be booming.  Buy your real estate now... In twenty years, it will be like Hong Kong in this area...  Don't worry.  I won't be here.&quot; firing a shot across the bar.<br />
<br />
Terry &quot;So you don't wan to be near us Sean?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;I'm just joking... Ladies...&quot; <br />
<br />
Terry asks &quot;So Sean? What's your last name?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean lies and says &quot;Bean... Sean Bean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nora says &quot;That's an English name...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;No.  I'm Scottish... &quot; as he works his &quot;interested&quot; new friends at the bar.<br />
<br />
Terry says &quot;Well... I'll guess have to search the New York Area for a Sean Bean since I'm a corporate spy and all...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Happy Hunting... Ladies... You won't find me... Noboby will tell you anything...&quot; and chuckles.<br />
<br />
Terry says &quot;Well Sean... I wish I could say it was a pleasure to meet you... But I can't&quot; she fire backs across the bar.<br />
<br />
Bars in the New York City are more of a &quot;disguised warfare&quot; cocktail party.  Some people go in to see their friends at the bar, makes jokes or swap funny stories.   Bars like this don't really exist anymore with &quot;ultra cool&quot; super rich of the client-server revolution, tech years and the dot com bubble.  Everyone is a millionaire or billionaire on the coast of Manhatan called Hudson County.  Other people go to &quot;spy&quot; on people from Manhattan and firms in Exchange Place.  They are the &quot;bad customers&quot; of business bars.  Sean knows this only too well... He has had some bad experiences and isn't open to &quot;sharing his life...&quot; at the bar.  Like Chevy Chase in Fletch, he gives different names and different firms to women who make meet him at the bar.  He knows they could be up to something...<br />
<br />
Ray comes back with their drinks and says &quot;Is Sean giving you a hard time?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry says &quot;Not really... But he is being rude and obnoxious...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nora says &quot;No wonder why he sits alone...&quot; in support of Terry.<br />
<br />
Ray says &quot;He may sit alone... But he never leaves alone...&quot; with a straight face.<br />
<br />
Terry confused &quot;Why does he meet someone later...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray says &quot;Usually...&quot; trying not to laugh...<br />
<br />
Terry asks &quot;Does he have a girlfriend who meets him here?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray says &quot;Not exactly... He usually throws them into the sea...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nora angrily says &quot;I see... I've met his type before... Let's go to the other end... So &quot;Sean&quot; can be &quot;alone&quot; sarcastically.<br />
<br />
The two ladies move down the end of the bar.  Terry looks back out the corner of her eye as she walks away.<br />
<br />
Ray asks &quot;What happened?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;These nosey bitches were asking me my life story and they just sat down at the bar...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray responds &quot;I'll see what they are up to... The Nosey Bitches...&quot; and laughs.<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Ok.. Let me know what you find out... But the brunette is smokin hot... Just my type... What a shame...&quot;<br />
<br />
Rays replies &quot;I know... I thought you'd be all over that... like white on rice...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean ends the conversation &quot;Good women are so hard to find these days...&quot;<br />
<br />
And Roy goes on to work them at the other end of the bar.<br />
<br />
Sean lights up a cigarette to sit and reflects on his &quot;new friends&quot; down the end of the bar now...<br />

<br />
Sean Kelson finishes his drink... Asks Ray to call him a cab... He waits patiently for the cab watching the ice cubes slowly melt in his glass.  He notices Terry and Nora looking at him and talking quietly to themselves.  Occasionally he smirks or smiles at them.  He knows that they are up to no good.  He knows that older women do not &quot;hit on&quot; younger men openly in bars or on the street.  Their &quot;instant friend&quot; behavior and questions have set off alarm bells.  He notices their accent.  It sounds &quot;Californian&quot; not &quot;Jersey&quot; or &quot;Manhattan Upper East Side&quot;.  They don't appear to be &quot;insurance executives&quot; as they claim.  <br />
<br />
Ray comes back to Sean and says &quot;The cab should be here in 15-20 minutes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean ask Ray &quot;So what did you find out about those two...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray says &quot;Not much yet... But I don't think they like you... Don't be fooled by their smiles&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean answers and laughs &quot;I know... Something so odd about them... They are not from around here... California is my guess&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray startled asks &quot;Why do you say that?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;I know accents... They are from Orange County or LA...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray amused follows on &quot;LA Bigshots huh? This should be fun.... &quot;<br />
<br />
Sean replies &quot;Yeah... Real fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean goes outside for a smoke.  He lights up a cigarette.  He only uses one hand to light it.  It's a trick he saw in a movie.  It always amuses him.<br />
<br />
He smokes and looks around the lonely plaza Exchange Place plaza on the Hudson River New Jersey side.  He looks at the &quot;Soldier with The Rifle in his Back&quot; statue.  He laughs and thinks.  &quot;No one ever really notices that statue... Haven't the read the back? SIBERIA.  This is WALL STREET SIBERIA. The Real Wall Street is just across the river.  It's a warning to everyone taking the PATH train to Wall Street.  It's a rough place...&quot; and laughs to himself.<br />
<br />
He decides to take a walk.  He goes down the block and around the corner to the back entrance of the Union Bar.  It is dark and deserted except for a black stretch limosine.  The driver is not around.  He must be up the block at the Flamingo diner or pretending to be a patron of the bar as a bodyguard or something.  He smiles to himself.  He knows whose limo it really is and their in the bar.<br />
<br />
He goes back around the corner.  He goes in the bar to pay his tab.  He sees Terry and Nora at the end of the bar.  He calls Ray over.  He tell Ray to buy them a round.<br />
<br />
Roy says their are drinking &quot;a Tom Collins and Manhattan&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;order them a Blue Hawaii each... says it from me&quot;.<br />
<br />
Roy asks &quot;Blue Hawaii? are you sure?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;I'm positive.  You should see whats out back?... Go through the kitchen&quot;...<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Here is 30 bucks for my tab.  Keep the change.  It should add up to 7 as usual&quot; and laughs.<br />
<br />
Roy says &quot;You should start leaving more than 7 Sean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;7 is all you get out of me...&quot;<br />
<br />
And leaves the bar.  The cab arrives moments later.<br />
<br />
The cabbie asks &quot;Where to?...&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Take the Turnpike South... To exit 14A.  I'll tell you where to go from there...&quot;<br />
<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Re: The Shadow Government... Chapter Two</b><br />
<br />
Sean heads to work again.  Today is Friday.  He loves Friday.  He can cut loose his &quot;wall street persona&quot; and head down the shore or up the mountains.  Or he can &quot;go out&quot; with the locals at night but that is always dangerous.  Too many characters where he lives.  People right out of &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; or &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;...  He parks his car.  A mustang.  Souped up with an aero kit and pin stripping.  black.  He looks for Claire's car.  A miata MX-5 convertible black with tan interior with a deluxe sound system.  8 speakers. 4 in the door and 4 the headrest.  He wonders if she is &quot;insider trading&quot; to afford a decent sports car.  But it is really only in the mid-20s.  She told him she was a &quot;put options&quot; clerk.  He doesn't believe her.  He knows she is an &quot;eye candy executive secretary&quot; like her friends Terri and Dawn.  He wonders how they got those jobs right out of high school with no contacts or connections that he knows of... <br />
<br />
He reaches the platform.  He looks around for Claire and Laura but they are not there.  He thinks about letting a train or two go by so he can run into them.  But he decides its not worth it.  The more trains that go by the more nervous he will become.  He gets on the next train and arrives in the city. He walks to work up Greenich Street.  He loves that neighborhood.  It's like a secret neighborhood in Manhattan.  Nioe Restaurants.   No Stores except for a supermarket, a deli, a japanese takeout and a pizzeria all on one side.  The hip cool restaurants like Tommy Tangs and Tribeca Grill on the other along with all the other restuarants and bars.  He thinks it would be a nice quiet neighborhood in Manhattan.  Close to Wall Street.  But David Letterman and Robert DeNiro just moved in... He knows the secret is out and it will be a &quot;celebrity hellhole&quot; in a few years.  He mourns the loss of Tribeca to the &quot;mega celebrities&quot; but they seems to be no stopping them.<br />
<br />
He gets to his desk and reads his mail.  As he reads the emails on the computer screen, he gets a phone call.  <br />
<br />
Sean answers &quot;Hello?....&quot;<br />
<br />
The man on the phone says &quot;I'm Tom Gillespie... I'm a recruiter... A headhunter...  Someone recommeded you.  They say you are the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Thanks.  But who recommended me?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom Gillespie says &quot;I can't say.  He asked not to be mentioned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Ok. That's strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom Gillespie says &quot;How would like to work for MANHATTAN CITY BANK?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean laughs and says &quot;I see... I would LOVE TO WORK FOR MANHATTAN CITY BANK!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom Gillespie says &quot;I can practically GUARANTEE you will be hired...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean replies &quot;Alright.  I'll give them a shot.  I'll go to an interview but I just started here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom Gillespie says &quot;Don't worry about that... You working on a help desk? Right? You don't want to be doing that for long... You'll leave anyway...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean answers &quot;You'll probably right.  But I promised my new manager I wouldn't leave right away...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom Gillespie answers &quot;But its MANHATTAN CITY BANK?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean agrees &quot;Your right.  Why work here... When you can work for the top firm on Wall Street&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom Gillespie gleefully responds &quot;Great.  I'll set up an interview right away!... I'll call you back in an half hour or so.  Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean says &quot;Ok. Bye.  Thanks Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean laughs and thinks about Vito Baccurella - The Vice Chairman of Manahattan City Bank and grins.  I thinks &quot;I make finally make that promise come true...&quot; A promise or 'prophecy' he used to jokingly tell his friends and family after Vito Baccurella assualted him as a young teenager coming out of a Manhattan City Bank town car.  He even went into the schoolyard after Sean. He was kidding around with his daughter Kari.  They were playing ball tag.  And Vito Baccurella thought he was a Wall Street Tough Guy.  After the incident, he would say &quot;One day I'll work for Manhattan City Bank.  No one will remember the name Vito Baccurella at Manahattan <br />
City Bank... They will only remember the name Sean  Kelson - The Greatest Employee in Manhattan City Bank's history.. Vito Baccurella's name will be mud or scum.&quot;  It was a joke of sorts.  But now it seems it might come... true.<br />
<br />
TO BE CONTINUED.<br />

An agency that has no intials.  An agency that has 'special' employees.  An agency that has super surveillance technology that allows to watch people anywhere on earth and listen.  It has independent funding sources.  It is hidden from other agencies and is unkown to Congress and the President.\n\nIke instructed his new agency to watch and wait for the time when corporations and the government would unite against the people. And then strike. By telling Americans about the truth. Truth about secret societies and corporate boards all intermingled. People who want to start a oppressive one world government. People who want to depopulate the world and start over instead of leaving and going to the stars with technology being hoarded by our military. They were told to protect America at all costs. \n\nIke was told their 'evil' plans. And he rejected it.  He didn't just warn Americans\n\nHe took steps to protect America...\n\nSome call it the 'Shadow Government'...\n\nCopyright (c) 2006  John J. McMonagle  All Rights Reserved.",
