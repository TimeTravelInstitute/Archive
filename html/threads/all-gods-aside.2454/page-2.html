			Last night, I dreamt that my contortionist cowboy friend with a broken back gave me his Victorian-era flying car which was stored in the relocated garage that my dad used to own when I was a teenager. By doing so, we managed to foil the evil John Lithgow and his sidekick.<br />

</div>I would seperate dreams from memories. They are different. Although both can be induced by the imagination in your mind, however, dreams are things that are conjured by your awaken mind, the cause I don't know. However memories can come to you whether you remember it or not. For example you memorise a scene but you do not memorise its absolute details and some of these details are then set up in your mind that has never existed here before. I have learnt from Discovery channel that the reason we don't remember things is because at the center of our brain, there is filter channelling memories. It helps you to filter out large chunks of memory so that you do not overload. However, autistic people do not have this filter and some are extremely capable of memorising details. This autistic person could use both eyes to read both sides of a book at once and memorised its details. Another guy could see a large concrete jungle scenery and could draw everything out to detail including the number of details. However, this also leads side effects like being anti-social and being withdrawn from everything as the brain gets confused very easily without the filter.<br />

			Actually, I always thought that Satan got a bad rap. Let us not forget that the only documents we have chronicalling this time were written by the winning side, many years after the fact. They are, essentially, propaganda for the victors. I suspect the truth of the story (well, I don't believe any of it's true, but if it were...) is a lot closer to the version told in the Pete &amp; Dud original Bedazzled.<br />
<br />
But, even with this propaganda in place, the story isn't quite as it's commonly thought. Re-read the story of the Garden of Eden. Satan tells the truth. God lies. And, yes, Adam and Eve are expelled from Eden because God is worried that they will eat from the Tree of Life, becoming immortal, and therefore equally as powerful as him.<br />
<br />
If you believe what is written in the Bible to be the literal truth, then Satan was actually right.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>There's a flaw in that reasoning. You see, if he knew Adam and Eve could potentially eat from the Tree of Life, why would he put it there? Doesn't he have absolute control? Didn't he create the world? The Tree of Life was planted to test their faith to him. That was the only absolute way to rebel against him, by eating the Tree of Life. Everything placed on earth at that time had a reason. <br />
<br />
The bible is already 3000 years old, written by different authors for each book. It is pretty obvious who is bad here, yeah? I don't see it essential why we should pledge allegiance to Satan? After all, doesn't Satanism has an anything-goes philsophy? Their ultimate virtue is do anything you desire, murder, slaughter, rape, rob, steal, commit adultery! There is no right and wrong, no evil, just something created from the mind! That's satanism and this is the idealogy of Satan himself, do you think you should believe in a total lawless and absolutely corrupted religion as such? Imagine what happens if society becomes like that? The victor is God, you don't see Jesus succumbing to temptation and he willingly died for Man. As he was in the human form, he himself felt pain, and he died for us. This does not seem so great, it's just another Man dying and he may not even be God. But in my view, he is a God our creator, who has humbled himself to die. In Satanism, what does Satan do besides giving in to temptations, promote corruption and evil? It is obvious who is good or bad.<br />

</div>If this people could do it and yet it wasn't done by them? Then who did? Surely something supernatural was involved, there is no better reasoning besides demonic forces. They may not be omnipresent, but they are everywhere by the numbers. Just like having a guardian angel, there are demons that haunt you.<br />

There's also a text-only version of the site, but it doesn't have the clips.

<br />
It's probably worth trying again, as there was major, major stuff that happened on Big Brother last night, so I imagine the Channel 4 website as a whole was innundated with hits. If you still can't do so, I'd seriously try a different computer and/or browser. You do owe it to yourself to see the voodoo demonstration, as it is not only a wonderful example of mental manipulation, it also makes some very good points about the nature of New Age beliefs, and beliefs in general. It's very powerful.]  <br />

</div>Or the placebo effect? Have you heard of Animal Magnetism? It was formed by this guy called Coue. He used the power of magnets to heal, later he found out he didn't need to use magnets anymore, just his mind. He then re-named this to Animal Magnetism. His favourite quote was Everyday in Everyway, I get better and better. This quote was used in a Garfield strip recently. People use to chant that phrase with him. However, when his group grew larger and such healing became the norm, he started losing his powers and it soon died down. It was revived in the 60s later by Benjamin Creme.<br />

			Well, there's evidence to suggest that remote viewing is more like lucid dreaming, but yes, it's all self-delusion.<br />
<br />
BTW, if anyone believes that they really can do remote viewing, the acid test is to have an independant volunteer write something on a peice of paper, and put in in a different room, never letting you see the paper. You should then be able to tell them what's on the paper.<br />
<br />
And, if anyone can actually do this (or anything else paranormal), then get in contact with James Randi, and earn yourself a quick and easy $1,000,000.

</div>Hm, strangely the military are also using remote views in hope of discovering plans or spy on their enemies.

He put his hand on the woman's head and cast the demon out of her, and she lost her powers, period.<br />

			I can't find it again today (though, in truth, I haven't looked too hard). But it was from a medical site.<br />
<br />
Websites aren't inherently less trustworthy than any other medium. Some sites are generally trustworthy (and official medical ones would tend to fall into this category), some are partially trustworthy (FOX news or Al-Jazeera will report some facts, but also some lies, and have a tendency to editorialise, for example) and some are completely untrustworthy (any site that details a hollow Earth while not explaining how the physics doesn't add up would be very shady). Of course, it's wise to be skeptical with regards to all information, no matter the source. But websites are no less trustworthy in and of themselves than books, newspapers, television or anything else.

</div>Ah, the old urban legend theory. It is true however, the way it morphs into a exaggerating hoax. Such stories are highly incredible and are not trustworthy in anyway unless it is of truthful personal experience perhaps or written down with credibility or recorded down. I have read about FoaF last year and found it to be extremely true. Why, a common cure for nosebleeds (which I frequently have) is to hold ur head up to let the blood clot. We now know we should tilt our head slightly forward, apply direct pressure at the bridge of the nose to stop the bleeding. I argued with my mom over this and tried to explain to her it was an old wives tale. Alas, the power of urban legends dominates homemakers like her. I don't blame her, there are many gullible ones like her too.</div>

			Actually, I think the majority of people aren't skeptical at all. I think they're credulous. People tend to believe things they are told, especially if they're written down or told to them by a trusted authority figure. If I could teach the world one skill, it would be to objectively eveluate the source of everything that they hear, and to be more skeptical.<br />
<br />
As for fear, that's an entirely natural emotion. what has changed is how people think the world will end. At this moment in time, people fear that their world will end because of terrorism, not because of a rain of fire.

Here's a nice link for people who are skeptics on the supernatural.<br />

<br />
Fear was here since the beginning of Man, back as long as the 12th century people believed the world was ending. Whether if it was the sky was falling down or the 12 eagles were a sign of a bad omen, it was the same fear we have today. Constant rife in the world everyday serves as a side dish to our fears. I guess what powers fear is ultimately death.<br />

			Done by who and how? The main cause of the spread of Eastern mysticism to the West was the Beatles going to India. At the time they were very anti-establishment, and the establishment were trying to suppress them. Are you trying to say that the Beatles were manipulated into this, or that they were part of the conspiracy themselves?

</div>The Beatles were rather hippy-like, like John Lennon, his wife Yoko Ono, and now his son Sean Lennon. Many people in the world today are unsuspectingly manipulated into spreading the New Age movement. If my memory serves me right, I seem to remember a small passage in the book about the Beatles, but it was rather minor. Yoga teachers, like the many here, used to be the non-believing citizen here but were crossed into the New Age after taking up yoga. <br />

			Naturally technology is not the answer to all of mankind's problems. It would be naieve to think that it was. Mankind's problems are down to the fact that, essentially, we are all animals that, while we have a highly developed herd and social instinct, we are still ultimately concerned with our personal dominance over others, and the propogation of our own personal genes. We have enough reason to not act instinctively all the time, but these instincts are undeniably the basis for almost everything that we do.

			You have absolutely no cause to apologise to me whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I am only concerned with people really objectively examining their beliefs and, as I said, evaluating their sources correctly. If you realise that you're trusting your sources without examining them critically enough, then it is my belief that you owe it to yourself to do so. Of course, whether you do or not is entirely up to you. If you're happy with what you believe and the evidence that you feel it is based on, then who am I to argue? All I can do is offer my perspective on issues you bring up, and tell you what level of evidence I would find acceptable.

</div>I may be too trusting, but I do have my limits in trust. I will ask myself to think whether it is really remotely possible. Some facts we cannot face it, some is too extreme but yet if we become too trusting, it becomes disillusional. The element of trust therefore, is up to a person's standard on a believeable basis.<br />

			I think you have a very valid point, yes. I'm also of the opinion that a lot of alternative medicines are, at least partially, down to a placebo effect. I'm not sure I'd count massage amongst them, but I'm definately in agreement with you in general.<br />
<br />
However, the placebo effect itself is a scientifically proven phenomenon. Even if these things are, then that doesn't completely devalue it.

</div>Valid as it is, it can't be entirely placebo either, although it seems to play a major part in most alternative medicine. It is proven, but it fails too, many a time too major to ignore. I rather base on proven things like drugs and medicine which has a proven and definite way to heal. Phenomenon to me is none other than unsolved things, especially on a theory.<br />

			I would suppose that these girls either pretended to be straight, or you didn't notice that they weren't straight, or they themselves didn't know. Teenage years are ones of great upheval and hormonal changes. Just because someone discovered that they were a lesbian after they left school does not in any way indicate that they were straight and have been somehow &quot;corrupted&quot;.

</div>They were straight all right, not till they attended a girl's school. Not only that, with hormones raging it is utimately common. In their schools, it is very common to see girl-girl relationships and them being intimate even in public. Just think, if that can happen to them, it can happen to other girls in their school, giving them a gender struggle or choice, especially when they are young.<br />

			Again, I don't believe the &quot;peer pressure&quot; or the &quot;media influence&quot; theory (in fact, the media influence theory for anything gets my goat. There have been numerous studies, and they have all, without fail, shown that to be a load of nonsense.<br />
<br />
As for it being okay for anyone to be gay...sure. Why not? There's nothing wrong with being gay, so why shouldn't people be free to be who they are?<br />
<br />
Not accepting homosexuals doesn't make people not be homosexual, it just drives it underground, causes them misery, and leads to discrimination and people getting hurt. I cannot see a single one of those things as being a good thing.

</div>Education here teaches us that peer pressure can make you do stupid things like shoplifting even if you were a person of virtue. Well, based on media here, people start taking up japanese/korean languages lessons because their pop idols speak that. They start having hairstyles based on anime of japan origin. They start dressing up like breakers because hip-hop is big here. They start skating because everyone skates and people who wear that clothes look cool or their friends do it. What is real is the smoking problem here, people smoke because their friends do it, it is often a friend offers them a cigarette before they are hooked. It is not a whole lot of goat. It is real. People take peer and media influence here very seriously.<br />

			This is your opinion, and in my experience is completely wrong. It's rather closed-minded, in fact.<br />
<br />
I wonder what you would make of me? I'm nowhere near as extreme as Erik or Tom, but I've got long, multi-coloured hair, 8 earrings in my left ear, a nose ring, and a labrette (middle of bottom lip) peircing. I also have two tattoos of my own design on my left arm, and have nearly decided on my 3rd.<br />

But the upbringing of a child, environment and influence affects his development. As for me, since young I have always read about the paranormal and was very interested in it until I discovered the Bible, it changed my life.

<br />
No, I don't think it undermines anything, except maybe the irrational xenophobic prejudice of not accepting what is not considered &quot;normal&quot;. Especially by people who, themselves, would not be considered &quot;normal&quot; by others. Who decides what is normal? Would you change your lifestyle if you were told it wasn't &quot;normal&quot;? Are non-permanant body-modifications, such as cutting or dying your hair, or having braces to straighten your teeth &quot;normal&quot;? Is dying your hair to a shade of brown &quot;normal&quot;, but dying it green abnormal?<br />
<br />
If you lived in India, it would be normal for you to have your nose peirced. If you were a memebr of certain African tribes, it would be normal for you to have your face permanantly scarred as you became an adult. <br />

</div>Morals and values are based on what is right and sensible in society. It is twisted if society accepts immoral concepts to be right or common and ignore it. It is just running away from the problem. I myself am told, am not normal, or my thinking that is. Just because I have deep thinking about the world, I am classified as weird. Or for the fact I do not fancy mainstream. Normalacy is not based on a person's exterior but on how he thinks. Do you call a murderer normal at all? I would say a mad man is more normal than a mass murderer.<br />

What you're saying here is the old censorship argument. It's alright for you to listen to Linkin Park, as they didn't influence you. It's all of those other people who are succeptible.

</div>Ah, interesting.  Again, it seems that you're basing your prejudices on misinformation and assumptions, then.  Erik has a job, he works, he is a very intelligent and sensible man, he was a doctoral candidate and has a philosophy degree, and he knows full well that his future is continuing to do what he does, and that his choice of career can sustain him (and his wife) until he dies.<br />
<br />
As for Tom Leppard, a job and working?  He's in his 60s.  He was a serving soldier for 28 years, and only started his mods after he retired.  He is also very intelligent, well-spoken and well-read.  As for his future?  He's retired.  This is his future.  This is how he wants to live.  You know how people express the wish to go off and live on a desert island somewhere?  Well, that's what he's done, except it's not a desert island on which he lives.  It's not substansively different from buying a retirement villa in Spain.  <br />
<br />
FWIW, he's a devout Catholic who prays for 3 hours a day.  You could say that he's devoting his life to God in the same way that a Monk does.<br />

So you have no reason to say that either of them are a &quot;bad-ass punk&quot; because they have body art on them.<br />

</div>To a certain degree.  The penalty for being discovered to be a homosexual in Sudan is death.  If they discover that you are gay, they will torture you to death.  Where's the influence there?  All the influence there is to <i>not</i> be gay.  And yet, people still get stoned to death and lynched there because they are gay.  Why?  Because the only thing that is actually affected by this influence is whether you feel that you can be open and honest about who you are, not who you are itself.<br />

			There's a flaw in that reasoning. You see, if he knew Adam and Eve could potentially eat from the Tree of Life, why would he put it there? Doesn't he have absolute control? Didn't he create the world? The Tree of Life was planted to test their faith to him. That was the only absolute way to rebel against him, by eating the Tree of Life.

</div>Nothing you've said disputes what I've said.  The story of the Garden of Eden goes like this: God created Adam and Eve and told them that they could do anything that they wanted to, except eat from The Tree Of Knowledge Of Good And Evil, because if they ate from that tree, they would &quot;surely die&quot; that day.  The serpent comes along and says to Eve, &quot;God is lying. Eating the fruit of this tree will not kill you.  God is just worried that you will have as much power as he does&quot;.  Adam and Eve eat from the tree.  God finds out.  He then says &quot;oh, dear, you ate from the tree, so I'm going to punish you.  If I don't throw you out from the garden, you might also eat from the Tree Of Life, and then you'd live forever, and would be as powerful as me&quot;.  Adam and Eve leave the garden and live for nearly another 1,000 years.<br />

</div>Well, apart from the fact that you seem to be under some serious misapprehensions about Satanism, I don't think anybody should follow any religion.  I think people should live their lives according to what they believe, and not hurt others.  Not because they're afraid of getting spanked if they do, but because they think it's the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
That is fairly in line with the Satanic beliefs (that's what the &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; bit is all about, really - taking responsibility for your own actions), but, no I don't think that it's a good religion to follow.  Better than some, though.<br />

		"articleBody": "Last night, I dreamt that my contortionist cowboy friend with a broken back gave me his Victorian-era flying car which was stored in the relocated garage that my dad used to own when I was a teenager. By doing so, we managed to foil the evil John Lithgow and his sidekick.\n\nYes, I'd say that the mind is capable of confabulation.  \n\n\n\nI would seperate dreams from memories. They are different. Although both can be induced by the imagination in your mind, however, dreams are things that are conjured by your awaken mind, the cause I don't know. However memories can come to you whether you remember it or not. For example you memorise a scene but you do not memorise its absolute details and some of these details are then set up in your mind that has never existed here before. I have learnt from Discovery channel that the reason we don't remember things is because at the center of our brain, there is filter channelling memories. It helps you to filter out large chunks of memory so that you do not overload. However, autistic people do not have this filter and some are extremely capable of memorising details. This autistic person could use both eyes to read both sides of a book at once and memorised its details. Another guy could see a large concrete jungle scenery and could draw everything out to detail including the number of details. However, this also leads side effects like being anti-social and being withdrawn from everything as the brain gets confused very easily without the filter.\n\n \nThat's your belief. Not mine.\n  \n\n\nI was just quoting an example. 'Lets just say'.\n\n \nActually, I always thought that Satan got a bad rap. Let us not forget that the only documents we have chronicalling this time were written by the winning side, many years after the fact. They are, essentially, propaganda for the victors. I suspect the truth of the story (well, I don't believe any of it's true, but if it were...) is a lot closer to the version told in the Pete & Dud original Bedazzled.\n\nBut, even with this propaganda in place, the story isn't quite as it's commonly thought. Re-read the story of the Garden of Eden. Satan tells the truth. God lies. And, yes, Adam and Eve are expelled from Eden because God is worried that they will eat from the Tree of Life, becoming immortal, and therefore equally as powerful as him.\n\nIf you believe what is written in the Bible to be the literal truth, then Satan was actually right.  \n\n\n\nThere's a flaw in that reasoning. You see, if he knew Adam and Eve could potentially eat from the Tree of Life, why would he put it there? Doesn't he have absolute control? Didn't he create the world? The Tree of Life was planted to test their faith to him. That was the only absolute way to rebel against him, by eating the Tree of Life. Everything placed on earth at that time had a reason. \n\nThe bible is already 3000 years old, written by different authors for each book. It is pretty obvious who is bad here, yeah? I don't see it essential why we should pledge allegiance to Satan? After all, doesn't Satanism has an anything-goes philsophy? Their ultimate virtue is do anything you desire, murder, slaughter, rape, rob, steal, commit adultery! There is no right and wrong, no evil, just something created from the mind! That's satanism and this is the idealogy of Satan himself, do you think you should believe in a total lawless and absolutely corrupted religion as such? Imagine what happens if society becomes like that? The victor is God, you don't see Jesus succumbing to temptation and he willingly died for Man. As he was in the human form, he himself felt pain, and he died for us. This does not seem so great, it's just another Man dying and he may not even be God. But in my view, he is a God our creator, who has humbled himself to die. In Satanism, what does Satan do besides giving in to temptations, promote corruption and evil? It is obvious who is good or bad.\n\n \nI would say that it's cynical exploitative people like John Edwards that are partially responsible for this nonsense. Mainly, though, it's people's credulity and desire to believe in something higher than themselves, and to feel \"special\". No demons involved.  \n\n\n\nIf this people could do it and yet it wasn't done by them? Then who did? Surely something supernatural was involved, there is no better reasoning besides demonic forces. They may not be omnipresent, but they are everywhere by the numbers. Just like having a guardian angel, there are demons that haunt you.\n\n [quoteTry the cache: http:\/\/216.239.59.104\/search?q=cache:0X8fxeLkJLkJ:www.channel4.com\/entertainment\/tv\/microsites\/M\/mindcontrol\/video\/+derren+brown+voodoo&hl=en\n\nThere's also a text-only version of the site, but it doesn't have the clips. Still interesting, though: http:\/\/www.channel4.com\/entertainment\/tv\/microsites\/M\/mindcontrol\/index_t.html\n\nIt's probably worth trying again, as there was major, major stuff that happened on Big Brother last night, so I imagine the Channel 4 website as a whole was innundated with hits. If you still can't do so, I'd seriously try a different computer and\/or browser. You do owe it to yourself to see the voodoo demonstration, as it is not only a wonderful example of mental manipulation, it also makes some very good points about the nature of New Age beliefs, and beliefs in general. It's very powerful.]  \n\n[\/quote]\n\nThanks. I can see it now.\n\n \n would say that they are nutters. Why would someone drilling a hole in their heads necessarily mean there was something supernatural going on? Is this just if they do it to excorsise demons, or does trepanning for the pseudo-scientific reasons count, too?  \n\n\n\nWell, they are dead. They belonged in the medieval era.\n\n \n Spoonbending was thoroughly debunked in the 70s. \n\n\n\nReally? I didn't know that although it doesn't seem as popular as before. \n\n \nPeople in the West aren't involved in Feng Shui. If you haven't buried your ancestors in certain ways, you're not doing Feng Shui. Simple as.  \n\n\n\nIt is growing in popularity over there though, soon you will find it all over the States.\n\n \nReliable accounts? And could these things be explained by adrenaline surges?  \n\n\n\nOr the placebo effect? Have you heard of Animal Magnetism? It was formed by this guy called Coue. He used the power of magnets to heal, later he found out he didn't need to use magnets anymore, just his mind. He then re-named this to Animal Magnetism. His favourite quote was Everyday in Everyway, I get better and better. This quote was used in a Garfield strip recently. People use to chant that phrase with him. However, when his group grew larger and such healing became the norm, he started losing his powers and it soon died down. It was revived in the 60s later by Benjamin Creme.\n\n \nI can't quite understand what you're saying with this sentence, but, no, medicine cannot cure everything. \n\n\n\nThe medicine is the product of the placebo effect, which is nothing more than sugar pills or vitamins that end up deterioating the patient's condition instead of improving it, with the use of placebo effect of course.\n\n \nThat's a myth, pure and simple. Unless given the hypnotic suggestion that you won't rememeber anything (and let us not forget that all hypnotic suggestions can be resisted), then you will remember everything.  \n\n\n\nI didn't know that, thanks for telling me. However, hypnosis auto-suggested or by the use of others are still the same though. I believe there is an article out there one why some states or possibly the country has banned the use of hypnotism for crime investigation.\n\n \nWell, that's pretty much the definition of the word, from the Greek: \"Psyche\" - mind, \"Logos\" - scholarly study of. nothing to do with anything outside the mind, though.  \n\n\n\n\n\nI agree.\n\n \n Well, there's evidence to suggest that remote viewing is more like lucid dreaming, but yes, it's all self-delusion.\n\nBTW, if anyone believes that they really can do remote viewing, the acid test is to have an independant volunteer write something on a peice of paper, and put in in a different room, never letting you see the paper. You should then be able to tell them what's on the paper.\n\nAnd, if anyone can actually do this (or anything else paranormal), then get in contact with James Randi, and earn yourself a quick and easy $1,000,000. You can give me a percentage as a \"finders fee\", if you like. http:\/\/www.randi.org\/research\/ \n\n\n\nHm, strangely the military are also using remote views in hope of discovering plans or spy on their enemies. In the Bible, there is this story of a woman who could tell the future and she suddenly spoke aloud in the presence of Jesus. He put his hand on the woman's head and cast the demon out of her, and she lost her powers, period.\n\n \nI can't find it again today (though, in truth, I haven't looked too hard). But it was from a medical site.\n\nWebsites aren't inherently less trustworthy than any other medium. Some sites are generally trustworthy (and official medical ones would tend to fall into this category), some are partially trustworthy (FOX news or Al-Jazeera will report some facts, but also some lies, and have a tendency to editorialise, for example) and some are completely untrustworthy (any site that details a hollow Earth while not explaining how the physics doesn't add up would be very shady). Of course, it's wise to be skeptical with regards to all information, no matter the source. But websites are no less trustworthy in and of themselves than books, newspapers, television or anything else.\n  \n\n\n\nI would say trustworthy sites usually does not have much of a research basis on its own but stories, ideas, articles that are taken from a 'credible' source, some only has minimal research done and it would require manpower to fully investigate a situation. \n\n \nHitler was taking massive amounts of amphetamines and methamphetamines (among other things) on a daily basis. What you describe sounds about par for the course, with absolutely no need for demons of any kind (except maybe figurative ones).\n  \n\n\n\nHm, it could be the effects of these trance inducing drugs. It was said he took these to hasten his meditation levels in order to become a God-man quickly. There are 2 steps to achieve 'enlightenment', through ardous years of meditation like Buddha or take trance-inducing druge to duplicate the same effect to hasten the 'years'.\n\n \nI don't believe in their power because one look at world politics should be enough to disprove most of the theories surrounding them.  \n\n\n\nWell, it would seem that the world would never be rid of problems and I believed some of these 'problems' were done on purpose. The only thing I know these groups are involved in, is the total control of finances.\n\n \nWhat do you mean by \"rebel\"? Are we talking about selling nuclear secrets to \"the enemy\"?  \n\n\n\n\nNo, for example, going against him in a political or physical way. He would easily annihilate them by 'blackmailing' them with their 'marks'. After all, he controls all finances that the world is crime-free under him, meaning no one is able to trade in the black market anymore, thus no nuclear weapons for anyone to rebel.\n \n\nThe way that the UN wants to unite the world is in the manner of disparate groups working together to solve the world's problems, rather than fighting amongst themselves. I don't see the problem with that.\n\nOf course the entire world under the rule of just one man would be prone to corruption. That's not what is being proposed at all. It is, in fact, something that the UN will fight against, and has explicit rules about.\n\nYou've also not explained what the problem is with solving the world's problems.  \n\n\n\nThe one-man rule would have a Cabinet of some kind, but he will be somebody that world can trust and he is the one who has the power to control all, finances etc. Well, you do know that opinions differ and there are many aspects to take into consideration. No matter how small the group, there would still be a number of representatives who will eventually decide that it is unfair. We have ambassadors, but they can't solve all problems either.\n\n \nI'm not Christian.  \n\n\n\nWell, I know. I mean the specific group of christians. They are not given special treatment in any way. We are all normal.\n\n \nAlways, but always make a copy of what you've typed in notepad before hitting \"reply\", if it's a long reply. Of course, accidents still happen. This is actually the second time I've typed this whole reply out.\n\nBut \"arduous\"? All it is is typing out your thoughts and beliefs. I worked 14 1\/2 hours yesterday, and I still managed it twice. \n  \n\n\n\nOk. It is frustrating and tiring to type it all out again. All my replies include 1 hour plus of typing plus thinking. I'm typing this after 6 hours of math tuition.",
