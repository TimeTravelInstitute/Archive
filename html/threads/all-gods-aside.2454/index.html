								<div class="bbWrapper">Ray's in triplicate please thread was an interesting debate and an outstanding thread, and great points were made by both sides but lets put the idea of an intellectual entity aside for a second and agree to disagree on that subject. Regardless, a system higher than the one we live in would be considered a fourth dimension, right? So our existence is a subsystem of a greater system that functions within the fourth dimension as we do the third?  Or does our existence in the third dimension define it as a colaborative subsystem, as a whole? I have no friggin idea <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
perhaps the fourth dimension is a system of organized chaos, where by all things defined in our dimensions subsystems have a higher counter part, or play a part in defining the higher systems which define the fourth dimension, similar to DNA and the millions of other subsystems, as we know them to exist, contribute to define the third dimension. <br />
<br />
I do not doubt that a fourth dimension exists but I have wondered how it could be detected. Sometimes it sucks to be human.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite4" alt=":mad:" title="Mad    :mad:" /><br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">All Gods Aside...I agree with you 1st Born.  The reason I brought up the Kaballah wasn't to influence anyone with regards to a belief in God or not.  The reason I mentioned it was that contained within its text some interesting theories on the creation of the Universe.  <br />
<br />
Many philosophers were masters of extracting possible truths to many questions.  I believe that if one gains an understanding of how the Universe operates (whether a God started the process or not ), then answers to many riddles may be solved, including time travel.  <br />
<br />
Should we ignore any thoughts from the masters of the past merely because they may have used a religious foundation for thier inquiries?  It would be easy to hide information from some people by inserting God in the text here and there, they would scoff and toss it aside, possibly missing some data that could hold the key.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">Consider this. A life in a cell comes about and you cannot bring it back to life once it is dead. A cell is a part of life, pulsating like us breathing. Where does this life come from? Until now men are never sure, until somewhat a celestial event happens. But while we are at this acclerating modern age. Scientists are duped to using witchcraft and holistic/traditional healing under the name of science, embracing a new age movement. They believe that all men can be gods. Well, I beg to differ really, or rather opinions differ in that sense, it sounds like completely lunacy to me and although I wasn't brought up in a very much religious environment, the power of christianity has stuck onto me and I'm very fascinated by bible prophecies which I'm currently studying.<br />
<br />
Theologians and scientists alike, all seek an answer to this answer to 'life' and the other mysteries of the universe like what we seek here, 'time travel'. I would say religious foundations cannot be thrown aside easily, after all it was a different age of society. Their interpretation might be different and after all most discoveries were inspired from religious texts itself. It's so fascinating that our ancestors were bestowed with wonderous knowledge we today with present technology cannot duplicate.<br />
<br />
All I want to add here is that the New World Order is approaching, I wish more people will take heed into seeing this blasphemous life, religiously attached or not. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> Live life happy, with purpose.</div>

	</div>
</div>Well, not duped but let's say they are using it now. I believe you are all familiar with the terms 'psychic powers', 'hypnosis, 'psychotheraphy' and so on? Isn't modern science using this techniques to so-called expand the minds of man, when it is actually the age-old ancient techniques practised by medicine men, witchdoctors, witches and so on? Isn't the trance state they achieve the same as the trances people practise? What about yoga and meditation? Have you noticed the sudden rise in newspaper ads for therapies of all sort, yoga, pilate and meditation? Have you seen countless Americans going to India to seek their 'true' self? I'm not saying all scientists, but especially athesist scientists are starting to believe that the Universe is one mind because they are not convinced there's a god out there. Since all this therapies and 'psychic powers' originate in the roots of hinduism/buddhism merged with aquarian philosophies and creative imaginations of men like Benjamin Creme. Why, you might be surprised to know that Hitler himself was actively involved in such occultic activities and practise psychic trances himself! <br />
Since, most men don't accept a god, they are led to believe that under the name of science Man has infinite mind potential and is going to EVOLVE to a higher state of consciousness. Have you read of WHO accepting traditional or alternative medicine? Yes they have, seen the pattern of alternative lifestyles and music rising? It is everywhere, on tv serials, cartoons, newspapers, magazines all sorts of media. I was even duped myself at the age of 13, thank God somehow I snapped out of it. I've been intrigued by the studying of this New Age movement and I have much to discuss about it. I have dug out my dad's old book collection and found some about it written in as long as 1990 and yet the details it provides unfolds with no mistakes.<br />

</div>Well, there has been a resurgence in people selling and practicing &quot;New Age&quot; things of late, yes, but that's to do with uncertanty in the world, and lack of trust in our leaders, rather than scientists having anything to do with it.<br />
<br />
BTW, if, by &quot;pilate&quot; you mean &quot;pilates&quot;, then it's just a fitness regime, not entirely dissimilar to step aerobics or calesthenics.  It's become fashionable recently due to celebrities practicing it, but from the 20s onwards, it's been primarily a discipline of modern dance.  Also used to help injured atheletes to recover. <br />

</div>It depends on your definition of &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;alternative&quot; medicine.  Willow bark, for example, is a painkiller.  Using it as such would usually be considered &quot;alternative&quot;, but the fact is that it's more effective and safer than asprin.  In fact, truth be told, asprin is an attempt to recreate the active ingredients of Willow bark artificially.<br />

</div>Yup, that's when the second big boom of this kind of thing really began, in the early 90s.  It kind of went out of fashion for a bit (althugh it's never actually gone anywhere), but is on the increase again.  It's still not as big as it was in the early 90s, or the 60s, though.<br />
<br />
I can't load that first site you linked up, and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking at on that second one.  I certainly see nothing about scientists to hand, there.</div>

It's become fashionable recently due to celebrities practicing it, but from the 20s onwards, it's been primarily a discipline of modern dance. Also used to help injured atheletes to recover. ]

Rather than saying it is part of society change that people involve themselves in seemingly 'occultic' activities, such as tarot cards, divination and wicca of all sorts. A survey was done in the last century and found that more people have become more superstitious than people in the 1920's especially since we are at the peak of science and technology. Drugs and meditation were quietly introduced into many parts of the world to achieve trance-states. <br />

			Okay, what I'm trying to explain here that modern psychology techniques originate from witchcraft, seances and well, since Men can't really fathom the brain anyway and yet we are messing with our subconsciousness.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I'm not sure I'd put it exactly like that, but, yes, I'll agree that psychology uses a lot of the same techniques as things like witchcraft and seances.  But that, to me, only goes to re-enforce the illegitimacy of seances and the like.  If the evidence of the supernatural is merely somoene being put in a hypnotic or semi-hypnotic state (a state in which people are very succeptible to suggestion and very prone to confabulation), then that's not very good for the case for spiritualism.<br />
<br />
In fact, a couple of weeks ago, &quot;psychological illusionist&quot; Derren Brown (yup, him again.  I'm a big fan) did a live seance on TV.  We all participated and spookily got in contact with the person that we were supposed to.  He managed to have a girl be a medium and reveal details that she couldn't possibly have known about the girl.  He then brought the actress who played the girl in some video clips in, and it was revealed that the show wasn't even live.  He also explained how he did some of the tricks.  He basically revealed how seances were nothing but psychological trickery.<br />
<br />
There's a review of it <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/06/02/154417.php" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, which is an interesting read.  I'll warn you, though, if you're easily offended, that the reviewr has a very foul mouth.<br />
<br />

</div>Metaphysics and spiritualism are two very different things, though.  It's a simple extention of already established theories.<br />

	</div>
</div>Maybe, but that doesn't mean that their techniques have any less of a basis in corporeal existence.  I mean, just because people thought that hypnosis was a connection with the spiritual world before it was understood doesn't mean that it actually <i>was</i> a connection with anything.  It's exactly the same with the pseudo-science hypnotists who &quot;regress&quot; people to &quot;past lives&quot; or who &quot;reconstruct&quot; UFO abductions with people.  What is now known about hypnotism and things like it makes these ideas being genuine very unlikely.<br />
<br />
I once saw a demonstration of how hypnotism makes people incredibly suggestible and also prone to confabulation.  A young woman who had never had anything unusual happen to her and who was a skeptic was put under.  In 5 minutes flat, without actually seeming to prompt her much, the hypnotist had her describing the experience of being abducted.  Afterwards, he showed her paper on which he had written exactly what she was going to say.  He hadn't seemed to suggest anything of the kind.  You can make very subtle suggestions, and make people think what you want them to.<br />
<br />
Again, this is also the kind of thing that Derren Brown is very good at.  Did you watch that link to the example of the voodoo doll I put in the other thread?  That's a great example of how even mild hypnotic suggestion can be very powerful.<br />
<br />

</div>Without seeing the survey itself, I can't really comment too much.  Unless I can judge the validity of the data, I can't judge the validity of the survey itself.  However, I would tend to agree with the findings, based on my limited anecdotal evidence (which is not a firm basis for anything).<br />
<br />
But if you go back further, the Victorian era would be the one that had the greatest interest and belief in the supernatural.  However, even if I were to accept that today is the most credulous era in history, I still don't see what conclusion I'm supposed to draw from that.  As I've stated, we're at possibly the most unsure time in history at the moment, we have unprecedented access to information, and we don't trust those in power at all.  It's no surprise that people are looking for surety and something higher than themselves that they feel that they can trust.<br />

</div>As you've already said, though, they've been prevalent throughout certain parts of the world for more time than can be accurately counted. Meditation techniques are an integral part of many Eastern religions, and certain Western religious practices can be said to share many similarities.  What is prayer if not a form of meditation?  The Eucharist shares much in common with hypnotic techniques, even down to the physical contact with a specific spot on the forehead.  As for drugs, Shamanisnm, for one, is based around the use of drugs.  Many aboriginal religions, too (particularly American Indian).  And you cannot downplay the importance of both techniques in voodoo.<br />

That these things should spread as long-distance travel and communication becomes more and more commonplace is harld a surprise, nor indication of any kind of conspiracy.<br />

</div>I think you'd be hard pushed to prove that.  What I think has increased is tolerance of and acceptance of homosexuality and transsexuals.  Let us not forget that not too long ago homosexuality was illegal and could have you locked up.  Given those circumstances do you believe it would be wise to &quot;come out&quot; to the world?  In fact, when it comes down to it, there are countrys in this day and age where homosexuality is a crime punishable by death.  I wouldn't say that we have more actual homosexuals here in England, but I bet we've got a hell of a lot more people who are openly homosexual than Sudan has.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's not always been this way.  In ancient Greece, for example, it was commonplace for young boys to be initiated into the world of sex by older men.  Plato, to pluck a name out of the air, would ahve had young apprentices, and it wouldn't just have been philosophy that he taught them.  Similarly, in Roman times homosexuality was the norm.  So much so, in fact, that it wasn't viewed so much as a seperate thing from heterosexuality, it was just all part of people's natural sexual drive.  Druids, too.  There have been many times in history that have been far more accepting of homosexuality than our time is.  In fact, so much so, that &quot;accepting&quot; isn't the word for it, any more than we would call our society &quot;accepting&quot; of people eating biscuits.<br />

			I'm not sure I'd put it exactly like that, but, yes, I'll agree that psychology uses a lot of the same techniques as things like witchcraft and seances. But that, to me, only goes to re-enforce the illegitimacy of seances and the like. If the evidence of the supernatural is merely somoene being put in a hypnotic or semi-hypnotic state (a state in which people are very succeptible to suggestion and very prone to confabulation), then that's not very good for the case for spiritualism.<br />
<br />
In fact, a couple of weeks ago, &quot;psychological illusionist&quot; Derren Brown (yup, him again. I'm a big fan) did a live seance on TV. We all participated and spookily got in contact with the person that we were supposed to. He managed to have a girl be a medium and reveal details that she couldn't possibly have known about the girl. He then brought the actress who played the girl in some video clips in, and it was revealed that the show wasn't even live. He also explained how he did some of the tricks. He basically revealed how seances were nothing but psychological trickery.<br />
<br />
There's a review of it here, which is an interesting read. I'll warn you, though, if you're easily offended, that the reviewr has a very foul mouth.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>It's not really a good idea to engage in spritualism or the supernatural, especially when you don't know what your messing. When a state of mind is calm and goes into a trance-like state, by Christian studies, it is said a demon under a mask of good such as angels, a guide, a master, or a wise old man is usually visualised and under the false pretense guides you through problems, but are actually the works of demonic forces. I have heard of that show, but I haven't the chance to watch it. Yes, it is very fake in some ways. But the centuries of practice must have some touch of supernaturality in it, thus, the demonic forces invloved in such activities. In my country, buddhism here is pretty widespread and chinese mediums are everywhere and can be easily found. Their methods is somewhat similar as they go into a trance and suddenly a force overtakes them. This can be explained by that a unknown force has tapped into their free mind 'port' as they go into a trance like state which leaves the mind free for any forces capable to overtake it. This forces to me are known as demons-in-disguises. <br />

			Metaphysics and spiritualism are two very different things, though. It's a simple extention of already established theories.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>In subject they are different things. But in the New Age theories, they work hand in hand. Example being Metaphysics can be linked to geomancy or feng shui, the method of feng shui is seeking supernatural forces to guide them and give them answers for the balance of yin and yang. All this invoves some sort of occultic involvement, minor or not. Spritualism is the advanced practice of traditional occult like witchcraft. Feng Shui can also be labelled as what we know as Eastern Mysticism, it is much the same really. Just a totally different concept and study.<br />

			Maybe, but that doesn't mean that their techniques have any less of a basis in corporeal existence. I mean, just because people thought that hypnosis was a connection with the spiritual world before it was understood doesn't mean that it actually was a connection with anything. It's exactly the same with the pseudo-science hypnotists who &quot;regress&quot; people to &quot;past lives&quot; or who &quot;reconstruct&quot; UFO abductions with people. What is now known about hypnotism and things like it makes these ideas being genuine very unlikely.<br />
<br />
I once saw a demonstration of how hypnotism makes people incredibly suggestible and also prone to confabulation. A young woman who had never had anything unusual happen to her and who was a skeptic was put under. In 5 minutes flat, without actually seeming to prompt her much, the hypnotist had her describing the experience of being abducted. Afterwards, he showed her paper on which he had written exactly what she was going to say. He hadn't seemed to suggest anything of the kind. You can make very subtle suggestions, and make people think what you want them to.<br />
<br />
Again, this is also the kind of thing that Derren Brown is very good at. Did you watch that link to the example of the voodoo doll I put in the other thread? That's a great example of how even mild hypnotic suggestion can be very powerful.

</div>Uh uh uh, again I must warn you that hypnotism has still many questions under it. First thing we don't understand how it works, secondly we don't understand why it happens. We just know we can intitiate it and we often get shocking answers. Hypnotism is a very strange subject we can't quite fathom. But what I suggest is that, Hypnosis does not have a very good basis in science. So far people who practise it, do not have any recollection or accounts of being hypnotised and what they said. They also seem to have strange vivid memories they never had in their lives. For example, this bloke was put under hypnosis and he recollected memories of his birth and the conversation the doctors had. Strange enough, we understand that babies under 3 years of age do not have the ability to store memories let alone a birth. <br />

</div>I would dare say millions do it daily. Ah! Pilates is movement and exercise, but there is sort of a combination of techniques practised in yoga and Pilates itself. Some people achieve Pilates by using meditation themselves. I have no claims but from a book, that some people who has practised extensive yoga and meditation has been diagnosed with personality problems. From what I have read, there are hotlines to help people who suffer split personalities and disturbing voices in the head after an extensive practice of yoga. Some people choose to ignore it, some call it a 'guide'. But those who are new to it find it disturbing and do not understand this voice. Perhaps I dare claim that this voices are demons but their victims are unprepared to accept them yet.<br />

			That a large political body has problems implementing anything and huge internal disputes woud be evidence against a conspiracy, not for one. In what way does the current state of the UN indicate a conspiracy?<br />
<br />
Again, I'm going to have to ask for a cite. That's certainly not what the UN Charter says.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</div><br />
Ah! Wait, before we start discussing extensively about the UN being a conspiracy. It is only a minor setup compared to the other organisations. Have you heard of the ancient Priory of Sion and Illuminati? The Priory of Sion is still here after many centuries and has its roots in europe and is know to be involved in a europe international bank. Perhaps you would be surprised to know that international banking had its roots from as long as the year 1600. Yes, there was such a thing but at that time with no such technology, it failed many times. Usually these international banks are set up by rich families such as the one we know to day as Hasburg, the predecessors to the Austrian Monarchy (If they ever decide to implement Monarchy again.). The Illuminati are an elusive group hiding behind the curtains of huge conspiracies such as the currency conspiracies. I believe that you know of the cashless society plan? They are part of it, under the plans of many people in all walks of life. It is hard to believe, but is that another reason why there are so many government secrets now? The UN goals may seem simple and a solution to world problems, but eventually this one-world government known as the anti-christ by prophets will be dogmatic and his rule will be much worse than the millions of massacared jews. We will be slaves by then as when he implements his mark on the forehead or right hand, we cannot buy or sell if we do not have this mark. Fabulous situation from theft and problems you say? Ah, but our every detail and location and be traced just by this mark and we would become slaves to him. The UN charter does not say such a thing, but their goal is simple. They want to unite the world in order to solve all world problems. The rest is left to the centuries of planning by the Men who plan to rule the world.<br />

			Without seeing the survey itself, I can't really comment too much. Unless I can judge the validity of the data, I can't judge the validity of the survey itself. However, I would tend to agree with the findings, based on my limited anecdotal evidence (which is not a firm basis for anything).<br />
<br />
But if you go back further, the Victorian era would be the one that had the greatest interest and belief in the supernatural. However, even if I were to accept that today is the most credulous era in history, I still don't see what conclusion I'm supposed to draw from that. As I've stated, we're at possibly the most unsure time in history at the moment, we have unprecedented access to information, and we don't trust those in power at all. It's no surprise that people are looking for surety and something higher than themselves that they feel that they can trust.

</div>Yes you can say that, I do not have basis in my claims. But what I say is quite obvious. We can see people saying Friday 13 is bad luck and the practice of Halloween which is actually a pagan tradition. We can go back to the Victorian era and say as such, but this modern world has reached a pinnacle in technology and yet, we are still skeptical beings and we fear things that we don't comprehend. Especially when it comes to the end of the world, people fear it but never do anything about it. That thought amuses me how we ignore something right on our faces.<br />

			As you've already said, though, they've been prevalent throughout certain parts of the world for more time than can be accurately counted. Meditation techniques are an integral part of many Eastern religions, and certain Western religious practices can be said to share many similarities. What is prayer if not a form of meditation? The Eucharist shares much in common with hypnotic techniques, even down to the physical contact with a specific spot on the forehead. As for drugs, Shamanisnm, for one, is based around the use of drugs. Many aboriginal religions, too (particularly American Indian). And you cannot downplay the importance of both techniques in voodoo.<br />
<br />
That these things should spread as long-distance travel and communication becomes more and more commonplace is harld a surprise, nor indication of any kind of conspiracy.

</div>It may not seem like a conspiracy for all. But this is done to prepare the future generations to embrace the New Age unknowingly. Prayer has many concepts and forms, some involve meditation to induce prayer and some talk to a higher being for help. Either way, it helps but in different resuls. Yup, you are right about the use of drugs. But since we are a modern society do we really need such things to interfere with progress? Obviously, there is something going on with that. We invent, we progressed, we have power, but something overlaps all this, we have more problems instead. What seems good seems to be overwhelmed by cons instead.<br />

I believe the effects are the name, nevertheless many people do not take this as evidence. I would say it is rather healthy somewhat, but still part of the New Age concept.

			I think you'd be hard pushed to prove that. What I think has increased is tolerance of and acceptance of homosexuality and transsexuals. Let us not forget that not too long ago homosexuality was illegal and could have you locked up. Given those circumstances do you believe it would be wise to &quot;come out&quot; to the world? In fact, when it comes down to it, there are countrys in this day and age where homosexuality is a crime punishable by death. I wouldn't say that we have more actual homosexuals here in England, but I bet we've got a hell of a lot more people who are openly homosexual than Sudan has.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's not always been this way. In ancient Greece, for example, it was commonplace for young boys to be initiated into the world of sex by older men. Plato, to pluck a name out of the air, would ahve had young apprentices, and it wouldn't just have been philosophy that he taught them. Similarly, in Roman times homosexuality was the norm. So much so, in fact, that it wasn't viewed so much as a seperate thing from heterosexuality, it was just all part of people's natural sexual drive. Druids, too. There have been many times in history that have been far more accepting of homosexuality than our time is. In fact, so much so, that &quot;accepting&quot; isn't the word for it, any more than we would call our society &quot;accepting&quot; of people eating biscuits.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>It is the norm in most societies. However, what changes this and acceptance now is how Man is opened up to such ideas and this is sort of like an international acceptance to gays, this previously wasn't allowed. Now we see many youths who were intitially straight and are now influenced to engage in this homosexual lifestyle and a struggle for gender identity. This again is another step to embrace the New Age. From my personal experience, in girl's schools in my country. I have known many girls who were straight but later became lesbians and it shocked me really. They were friends of mine and they were rather normal and it was appalling to accept their new preference. Thus accepting homosexuality would only mean that it is right for anyone to do it, under peer influence and media. <br />

</div>Ah! Combining this with homosexuality, we can't tell what a person thinks just by watching TV. Reality TV as such as made such see things in such a narrow point of view. This people are definitely disturbed to adopt such a lifestyle. If he/she were normal and did not come under strange influences, they wouldn't be doing such extreme things. After all as a child, we do not have such dreams and is this what we call 'maturity'? I think plastic surgery and the belief of exterior beauty combined with reality TV and the increasing rates of alternative lifestyles degrade what is supposedly normal. I can't accept this as I do not believe that Man under minor or major circumstances should do such a thing. It degrades morals and values, don't you think so? What was right and appropriate is now twisted into 'acceptance'. I would rather people discourage such lifestyles instead of criticising it.<br />

			I wonder how &quot;alternative&quot; something in the mainstream can be? I certainly don't see the connection between boyband dross like Linkin Park or Avril Lavigne and man having &quot;infinite mind potential and is going to EVOLVE to a higher state of consciousness&quot;.

</div>I used to be a fan of Linkin Park themselves. 'Alternative' music also mainstream can change a person. I have seen it. The lyrics of certain songs do change a person's way of thinking. I have a personal close friend who under the influence of such dark music has led herself to self-infliction of pain and thoughts of suicide. Many personalities are also affected. For me I myself listen to a range of music such as classical, trance, house and progressive. It is ironic though. But the power of music is certainly strong.<br />

			Are you talking about this (AMD Opteron 246)? Do you have a cite for it being able to store &quot;every detail&quot; of everyone on Earth? Exactly what do you mean by &quot;every deatail&quot;? How would all this information be gathered? There's an infinite amount of details that could be stored about any one individual.

</div>Yes logically. You might have heard of some advances of late, about supercomputers able to do trillions of calcilations and being able to store terabytes of data and exchanging a load of data in a matter of seconds. By the meaning of 'every detail' I do not mean everything, but rather personal information of their lives, including their location of the past day, things like that. Sort of like the 'Big Brother' conspiracy. My country uses an ez-link card for public train and bus transport and our data of our locations is stored daily. We can even purchase MacDonalds with this cards. This technology is the first step of the cashless society.<br />
<br />
Finally, you ask great questions and I find pleasure in answering your questions. I am not trying to make a point, rather, I just want to educate people what is really happening, although my writing is not really convincing in a way.</div>

			It's not really a good idea to engage in spritualism or the supernatural, especially when you don't know what your messing.

	</div>
</div>Ah, but, both Derren and I do believe we know with what we're messing.  The way a ouija board works is through tiny involuntary muscle spasms which move the glass according to your subconsious.<br />
<br />
A group of researchers did an experiment with a mixture of believers and non-believers.  First they did a seance &quot;normally&quot;, and everyone was surprised when it worked.  Next, they showed everyone the board, blindfolded them, and continued.  Again, it worked.  Then they did the same but after blindfolding the volunteers they turned the board round by 180 degrees.  It spelled out gibberish.  However, upon playing the tape back (it was all being recorded), they saw that had they not turned the board round, the movements of the glass would ahve made sense.  They then did the same, except they turned the board upsidedown.  Again, the glass moved to where the letters <i>were</i> before the people were blindfolded.<br />
<br />
And, lest you forget, the spirit that Derren's subjects contacted and &quot;channeled&quot; the details from was actually an actress, not a medical student who had died 30 years ago.  The entire story was ficticious, and that they got the made-up details right from the minor clues and suggestions that they were given is further proof that it's all bunk.  <br />
<br />
I cannot emphasise it enough - what they did was the equivalent of channeling the spirit of Darth Vader and revealing details such as his real name being Annikin and that he's an orphan.  If it proves anything, it proves that seances are bunk.<br />
<br />

</div>Feng Shui is an interesting example, as it's got to be the most misunderstood peice of spiritualism in the west.  People think it's all about where you put your sofa, and don't know that 50% of it is about where and how your ancestors are buried.  Also, it's not just what hte inside of your building looks like, but the outside, where it's located, what the landscape is like...etc.<br />
<br />
I think it's a wonderful example of appropriation of an idea that seems &quot;cool&quot; without actually having any understanding of the ideas and beliefs behind it.  Quite a good metanym for a lot of New Age beliefs, in fact.<br />

If I could teach the world one skill, it would be to objectively eveluate the source of everything that they hear, and to be more skeptical.<br />

<br />
As for it being okay for anyone to be gay...sure.  Why not?  There's nothing wrong with being gay, so why shouldn't people be free to be who they are?<br />
<br />
Not accepting homosexuals doesn't make people not be homosexual, it just drives it underground, causes them misery, and leads to discrimination and people getting hurt.  I cannot see a single one of those things as being a good thing.<br />

I wonder what you would make of me?  I'm nowhere near as extreme as Erik or Tom, but I've got long, multi-coloured hair, 8 earrings in my left ear, a nose ring, and a labrette (middle of bottom lip) peircing.

<br />
No, I don't think it undermines anything, except maybe the irrational xenophobic prejudice of not accepting what is not considered &quot;normal&quot;.  Especially by people who, themselves, would not be considered &quot;normal&quot; by others.  Who decides what is normal?  Would you change your lifestyle if you were told it wasn't &quot;normal&quot;?  Are non-permanant body-modifications, such as cutting or dying your hair, or having braces to straighten your teeth &quot;normal&quot;?  Is dying your hair to a shade of brown &quot;normal&quot;, but dying it green abnormal?<br />
<br />
If you lived in India, it would be normal for you to have your nose peirced.  If you were a memebr of certain African tribes, it would be normal for you to have your face permanantly scarred as you became an adult.  <br />
<br />
How do you define &quot;normal&quot;?<br />

			Ah, but, both Derren and I do believe we know with what we're messing. The way a ouija board works is through tiny involuntary muscle spasms which move the glass according to your subconsious.<br />
<br />
A group of researchers did an experiment with a mixture of believers and non-believers. First they did a seance &quot;normally&quot;, and everyone was surprised when it worked. Next, they showed everyone the board, blindfolded them, and continued. Again, it worked. Then they did the same but after blindfolding the volunteers they turned the board round by 180 degrees. It spelled out gibberish. However, upon playing the tape back (it was all being recorded), they saw that had they not turned the board round, the movements of the glass would ahve made sense. They then did the same, except they turned the board upsidedown. Again, the glass moved to where the letters were before the people were blindfolded.<br />
<br />
And, lest you forget, the spirit that Derren's subjects contacted and &quot;channeled&quot; the details from was actually an actress, not a medical student who had died 30 years ago. The entire story was ficticious, and that they got the made-up details right from the minor clues and suggestions that they were given is further proof that it's all bunk. <br />
<br />
I cannot emphasise it enough - what they did was the equivalent of channeling the spirit of Darth Vader and revealing details such as his real name being Annikin and that he's an orphan. If it proves anything, it proves that seances are bunk.

</div>It is bunk, but is it really power of the mind, your deep subconscious controlling this 'muscle spams' and 'actions', does your mind really evoke mind memories you never had in your life? Well, let's just say, there really is a God of the Jews and there is also a Satan and his minions of twisted angels. We do know what his goal here is, don't you? You are familiar with his story? He was once the most beautiful and perfect creation of God and as he coveted God's position, he claimed that since God created all things, then ALL things can or must be God. With this idealogy, he led several legions of angels to rebel against God and God threw them into hell for imprisonment. But I must say that Satan resides in hell no longer, he in the bible is know as the Price of the Air and Land. He is right here right now, controlling all evil that happens in the world. So as we with our limited brain capacity have no ability to practise further mind abilities are deceived by this minions of having such powers. Plus, the power of media and influence and groups and seminars have led to people having the idea they might have psychic powers. Some try to develop it, some study it and some ignore it. But the truth is, we do not have such powers, it is only the ruse of demonic forces.<br />

			Feng Shui is an interesting example, as it's got to be the most misunderstood peice of spiritualism in the west. People think it's all about where you put your sofa, and don't know that 50% of it is about where and how your ancestors are buried. Also, it's not just what hte inside of your building looks like, but the outside, where it's located, what the landscape is like...etc.<br />
<br />
I think it's a wonderful example of appropriation of an idea that seems &quot;cool&quot; without actually having any understanding of the ideas and beliefs behind it. Quite a good metanym for a lot of New Age beliefs, in fact.

</div>Ah, many countries declare themselves secular, but in fact many use feng shui to control flow in their countries. For example, the placement of buildings and the designs of structures. My dad once told me a Feng Shui master friend of his told him about the placement of a large statue changing its position because of bad feng shui and there are two buildings which have a large gaping hole in it. From a building if you look at it, it is weird it seems like a large hole letting wind blow through it. People in the west think doing such things are cool and can improve their lives and yet they don't know what they are getting involved in. The New Age is specially prepared of modern man as Cool and Useful and can be practised by ALL.<br />

Yoga, as I have said, its positive effects are a mask to 'enlighten' people to practise it, to use meditation to de-stress and give them calming abilities to work well in society. But ah, this hotlines are not so famous and the book I have read from is about nearly a decade ago, so I don't think anything much is published about this hotline. But if you must say I'm gullible, I would say the unprepared yoga practice may lead to the pre-mature control of demonic forces, making it seem like split personalities. Hitler himself had many nightmares and split personalities when he practised meditation. He went into a strange trance, screaming and spams for help from his intrepid and cruel Higher masters.

								<div class="bbWrapper">I have an interesting story regarding the ouija board.  In high school some of my friends got together and did a session.  They invited an adept occultist to join in with the event.  He did rituals and read from the Satanic bible.  The people had success with the board spelling out with the spirit responding that it was an enemy of God, a christian in the room got angry and broke the board into pieces and threw it into the fire.  The fire raged out of control, even long after the board was all burned up.  The next night, without the christian in present, they did it again.<br />
This time the response was that it was to see the individual who threw &quot;him&quot; into the fire die.<br />
It provided a time frame of when it would do so.  No one told the christian what happened, but on the last day, in the last minute, the christian guy lost control of his motorcycle and crashed into the curb.  He was thrown into the side of a building and was found there dead, in the shape of an upside down cross.<br />
Even if merely a coincidence, it still gives me the willys when I think of this event.  <br />
<br />
Anybody that becomes adept at being able to focus their attention, regardless of the means will produce some type of effect within the scope of concentration.  One day I got very angry at someone...I mean REALLY angry, if I had a gun I would have shot him dead on the spot, without hesitation.  My entire being was foucused on him, the rage felt like it was beaming out of my pupils.  He looked at me and almost fell down, he got up and ran away in fear.  I never said a word, but somehow he knew my intentions.  The rage was driven by past events with unresolved spite, hatred and resentments.  The power was immense as it flowed through-out my body, nothing was able to distract my attention from the deep rooted drive to extinguish this guys life.  I couldnt even remember what set me off that day, and apologized to him shortly thereafter.  It never happened before or since.  It was a very strange event.    <br />
<br />
A co-worker has a sister that is a Nun for a childrens hospital in Orange County, California.  She told him the story about the day the priest and herself where performing a prayer for a recently passed girl.  The priest was doing the rites above the body of the girl, when all of a sudden the girl sat up, opened her eyes and looked around.  When she saw the priest she blurted out some foul language with a look of utter hatred set upon her face. Shortly thereafter she fell back...dead as a door knob.  Apparently, the Sister sees all kinds of unusual events that she will not discuss with her brother.  Another story that gives me the willies when I think about it.<br />
<br />
I used to play mind games on my friends back in the day, and it amazed me that with little effort they bought into all kinds of fabrications.  I even had a visit from the police one night to search my home for the &quot;electronic hallucination inducer&quot; that I told someone I had built.  I had showed him a remote control to the t.v. and unknown to me, he was under the influence of mushrooms and thought my invention had caused him to begin hallucinating.  On his way home the police stopped him and recognized he was on under the influence of something..prompting them to investigate my invention.<br />
<br />
We once had people believing in a  ghost that appeared to be behind the wheel of a hearse in a small junk yard. If you drove by on a moon-lit night, and looked into the drivers side window at midnight , you would be able see the ghost appear; a hooded figure sitting behind the wheel of the old black Cadillac.  I dont know how many people fell for that one...the hooded figure was merely a roll of carpet  placed on the seat of the hearse.  On a night with the moon in the sky, the lighting and shadows made it look like a ghostly figure. <br />
Nobody even looked to see what it really was..they stayed away in fear. <br />
<br />
Not really in the mood to debate tonight, just some stuff I remembered as I was reading this thread.</div>

Quest:It's about,..mmmmmhmm, about sixty feet long, very dark, almost a dusky green on its back.<br />
Wide at the head, about fifteen feet across.<br />
<br />
Ans<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big grin    :D" />id you see its eye?<br />
<br />
Quest:Wait I'll go look!?<br />
<br />
Ans:Oh no lady' don't go out on the fu*king dock, that thing will..........Oh well.......<br />
<br />
Quest:It seems friendly now that's it eaten, well half of my husband at least.<br />
It has an eye about the size of a soccer ball.<br />
<br />
Ans:Oh crap.......I think what you've got in your pond mam, is a Megladoncarcarkadon, or giant prehistoric shark.<br />
<br />
Quest:Well' are they dangerous?<br />
<br />
Ans:Bit your husband in-two mam, wouldn't exactly call it a house or an aquarium pet, mam.<br />
<br />
Ans:You had a question to ask here, are you done and if so would you rate my answer please?<br />
<br />
Quest:My question has not been asked.I'll do that now.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid that the government or someone will come in and take my husband away, since he was not killed by a normal creature.<br />
<br />
I also, kind-of, like the shark, for some reason and don't want it hurt.<br />
<br />
Ans:Hugh?<br />
<br />
Quest:Well' I mean it was only doing what it did naturally and really didn't mean to bite my husband in-half.<br />
I mean afterall, if left half of him on the beach, as I think that puddy felt guilty.<br />
<br />
Ans<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick out tongue    :p" />uddy......?<br />
<br />
Quest:Yes Puddy, I've already named him............But there is the question of both security and insurance and the government confiscating him and me not getting anything in return.<br />
What do I do in this forinstance, please?<br />
<br />
Ans:Well' there is the CIA, which deals in intelligence, but they dont operate domestically, or are not supposed to at least.<br />
Then there is the NSA, but they only deal with domestic threats to internal security.<br />
There is the Homeland Security, but do you think that this shark is an international terrorist?<br />
<br />
Quest:No, he does not look to be of foreign extraction, or associated with Al Quida.<br />
<br />
Ans:There is the DIA,.....NRO,....the SCPCA.Mmmm, I would say the FBI mam.<br />
<br />
Quest:Oh' then I'll call the FBI.<br />
<br />
Ans:Before you go, I would try to have them cut you a deal, as you don't want this hitting the press, as it would hurt the tourist industry.They just might take the shark and what is left of your husband and not give you anything?<br />
<br />
Quest:Oh?<br />
<br />
Ans:Here's what you do, call them and say that a loved on had died of alien-like circumstances, but want to see if you can barrow in the economic sense, so that they will give your husband and alternate ending.<br />
<br />
This way you get the insurance claim and what's coming to you, but the shark might have to go, however this will look as if it were an accident.<br />
<br />
Quest:But it was an accident and I don't thing Puddy really meant to.....<br />
<br />
Ans:Keep calm, for the time being, I know this guy in west Hollywood and he makes fiberglass replicates, for people; if you can get him a copy of the person that you want a fiberglass copy made of.<br />
<br />
Quest:Why do this?<br />
<br />
Ans:So that you can time the accident........With a replicant, you can drive around with you husband, so that everyone will think that he's still alive.<br />
<br />
Quest:Well if he does not move or something, won't that look kind-of suspicious?<br />
<br />
Ans:No, my friend had replications that even waive and smile.<br />
<br />
Quest:Oh,........that's different?<br />
<br />
Ans:The body now, where is it mam?<br />
<br />
Quest:Well it's down by the beach, in a Super-strength Trash can liner.<br />
<br />
Ans:Okay' here is what you do, you back you truck; have a truck?<br />
Quest:Yes I we have a pickup.<br />
<br />
Ans<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big grin    :D" />own to the body and lift it in using nylon ropes and then put it in your freezer.<br />
<br />
Then call the special investigations division of the FBI and say to them, to confidentially come to you house, as you husband was killed by an unusual creature, but you want to know if you can bargain the worth of the creature, so that they can give your husband an alternate ending?<br />
<br />
Quest:Okay I think I've got it and thank you so much!<br />
<br />

			Scientists are duped to using witchcraft and holistic/traditional healing under the name of science, embracing a new age movement.

	</div>
</div>Okay, not to be overly rude, friend nicknack, but what the hell does the New Age movement have to do with modern science?<br />
<br />
The New Age movement appeals to many people who desire truth, money, inner peace, money, absolution from the guilt of wanting money, and money. It borrows heavily from Eastern spiritual traditions, but the movement itself is all about allowing the yuppie offspring of the original hippies deal with the guilt of growing up in the &quot;me&quot; generation and becoming yuppies. <br />
<br />
I've grown up with the unspeakable torture of New Ager parents. From the outside, the New Age looks appealing to many people. Growing up within it, it has been revealed to me as the trendy sham that it is; barely classifiable as religion, and a major money farm for opportunistic snake-oil salesmen.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen, New Age and modern science have nothing to do with one another. In fact, they are basically at odds. Science typically rejects all that 2nd-hand hippie mumbo jumbo outright, and New Agers tend to think of science as mechanistic, impersonal, and without the REAL truth. <br />
<br />
But the whole debate is silly. Science is in a different category from New Age and from spiritual pursuit in general. You see nicknack, you are quite mistaken in one major respect. It is a mistake that many people, especially spiritually minded people (myself included) often make. It is as follows.<br />
<br />
Science isn't about Truth with a capital T. Science is about working models for various natural systems. Even scientists seem to forget this sometimes. The goal  of EXPERIMENTAL science is not so much to reveal the deep underlying nature of things as to come up with a knowledge of what results are predictable under particular circumstances. It is to devise models that DESCRIBE the world from first principles, but these models do not necessarily have anything to do with truth. Truth as an ideal is in the realm of religion, philosophy, and so-called metaphysics.<br />
<br />
Science makes no assumptions about the fundamental truth or meaning of reality. It is only interested in reproducible results and working models. Of course when science is used by people as religion, it becomes as sanctimonious and dogmatic as anything else, but on its own  science is not religion. Science is science. Religion is religion. Ideally, the two do not impinge on one another's territories.<br />
<br />
I don't know what scientists you've been talking to who believe all men can be gods, but they don't sound like very reputable scientists. I'd like to see their credentials. Science is concerned with allowing men (and women) to be healthier, smarter, happier, and longer lived. However, to want to make men like gods would seem to entail presuming that gods exist. This is beyond experimental verification, and is therefore beyond the realm of science. THAT'S WHY RELIGION IS AROUND. The two things are not at war, or at least they shouldn't be. They deal with different areas of human experience. Science does not strictly deny the existence of God or of cosmic meaning. It is simply not concerned with them.</div>

</div>Last night, I dreamt that my contortionist cowboy friend with a broken back gave me his Victorian-era flying car which was stored in the relocated garage that my dad used to own when I was a teenager.  By doing so, we managed to foil the evil John Lithgow and his sidekick.<br />
<br />

</div>Actually, I always thought that Satan got a bad rap.  Let us not forget that the only documents we have chronicalling this time were written by the winning side, many years after the fact.  They are, essentially, propaganda for the victors.  I suspect the truth of the story (well, I don't believe any of it's true, but if it were...) is a lot closer to the version told in the Pete &amp; Dud original <i>Bedazzled</i>.<br />
<br />
But, even with this propaganda in place, the story isn't quite as it's commonly thought.  Re-read the story of the Garden of Eden.  Satan tells the truth.  God lies.  And, yes, Adam and Eve are expelled from Eden because God is worried that they will eat from the Tree of Life, becoming immortal, and therefore equally as powerful as him.<br />
<br />
If you believe what is written in the Bible to be the literal truth, then Satan was actually right.<br />

</div>I would say that it's cynical exploitative people like John Edwards that are partially responsible for this nonsense.  Mainly, though, it's people's credulity and desire to believe in something higher than themselves, and to feel &quot;special&quot;.  No demons involved.<br />

It's probably worth trying again, as there was major, major stuff that happened on <i>Big Brother</i> last night, so I imagine the Channel 4 website as a whole was innundated with hits.  If you still can't do so, I'd seriously try a different computer and/or browser.  You do owe it to yourself to see the voodoo demonstration, as it is not only a wonderful example of mental manipulation, it also makes some very good points about the nature of New Age beliefs, and beliefs in general.  It's very powerful.<br />

BTW, if anyone believes that they really can do remote viewing, the acid test is to have an independant volunteer write something on a peice of paper, and put in in a different room, never letting you see the paper.  You should then be able to tell them what's on the paper.<br />

</div>I can't find it again today (though, in truth, I haven't looked too hard).  But it was from a medical site.<br />
<br />
Websites aren't inherently less trustworthy than any other medium.  Some sites are generally trustworthy (and official medical ones would tend to fall into this category), some are partially trustworthy (FOX news or Al-Jazeera will report some facts, but also some lies, and have a tendency to editorialise, for example) and some are completely untrustworthy (any site that details a hollow Earth while not explaining how the physics doesn't add up would be very shady).  Of course, it's wise to be skeptical with regards to all information, no matter the source.  But websites are no less trustworthy in and of themselves than books, newspapers, television or anything else.<br />

Not even going into the unlikely, innaccurate or impossible aspects of your story in any depth (the Satanic Bible actually has little to do with Satan, how do you find someone in the shape of an upside-down cross on a wall?), this makes the whole thing very suspicious.  As an amatuer folklorist, you'll be amazed at how many times the whole FoaF things turns up, and for how many clearly made-up and/or impossible things.  I bet you know someone who knows someone who was in a swimming pool and urinated, except it was one of those pools that has the chemical that turns the water purple in the presence of urine?  Except, of course, that that chemical doesn't exist, and even if it did, there's no <i>way</i> that a commercial pool would use one.  It'd be commerical suicide. You don't want to know how many people believe the Pop Rocks and Coke thing.<br />
<br />
Can I assume that you've had the details verified from a reliable independant source?  What was the name of this occultist?  Was his death in the paper, or on the local television news?  What did they have to say about the inverted crucifix?</div>

			Okay, not to be overly rude, friend nicknack, but what the hell does the New Age movement have to do with modern science?
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I understand what you people see in my replies here. But sorry to tell you, you have misunderstood my concept. I do not marry science into the New Age or religion whatsoever. I was talking about specific areas of science which is branched out to psychology and other mind studies. Quantum physics, chemistry etc does not have anything to do with it or none that I know of. <br />
<br />
I understand the New Age concept too, living in a muli-religious and racial enviroment combined with western culture and the growing New Age activities around here. It is a sham however, not the little of what you think but a major conspiracy and it involves the world. I don't ask you to believe me. I do not have credentials in my sayings, all I can prove is from the books that I have read. Anyway about the scientists thing, it is personal and it doesn't involve everyone, just a certain few. Just to let you know, Alber Einstein himself believed in God-men and a new cosmic religion. Don't believe me? Find some quotes that he says about religion, I recently this quote outside at a Buddhist Temple. If you didn't know, Isaac Newton himself was a Freemason and had close accquaintances who were deeply involved in the occult. This can be found on the internet, and I will try to source for it when I have the time.<br />
<br />
Basically, I would like to say your thinking is all passe. This religion and science thing is no longer at odds with each other. What have you read about acupunture and massages or Tai Chi which did not have any scientific basis end up having proof and explanations about how it works? The essence of such treatments orginally was spiritual and it did not require science to explain it. Now, with science all we can say it is balancing the CHI in your body? Where do you find CHI in medical science? What do you see in witch doctors treating people by going into a trance state and whispering nonsense have a scientific explanation or a theory at least? To sum it all up, I'm saying that the New Age movement is using science to mask what seems backward and traditional to appeal to worldwide consumers, ordinary people like us or your parents for example. I understand your frustrations about the New Age, but you have to see it in another point of view.</div>

Regardless, a system higher than the one we live in would be considered a fourth dimension, right? So our existence is a subsystem of a greater system that functions within the fourth dimension as we do the third?  Or does our existence in the third dimension define it as a colaborative subsystem, as a whole? I have no friggin idea :)\n\nperhaps the fourth dimension is a system of organized chaos, where by all things defined in our dimensions subsystems have a higher counter part, or play a part in defining the higher systems which define the fourth dimension, similar to DNA and the millions of other subsystems, as we know them to exist, contribute to define the third dimension. \n\nI do not doubt that a fourth dimension exists but I have wondered how it could be detected. Sometimes it sucks to be human.  :mad:\n\n\n1stBorn",
