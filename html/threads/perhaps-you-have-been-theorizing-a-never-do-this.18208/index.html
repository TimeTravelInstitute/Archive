								<div class="bbWrapper">I am the Resurrection and the Life - the Love of God.<br />
<br />
I am myself resurrection and Life, he who believes in me will live even if he dies, and no one who lives and believes in me will ever die.<br />
<br />
1. God is Love and Love is God, yet no one knows what It is â€“ we only know that It is.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you have been theorizing â€“ never do this! You must let the Truth unfold without suggestions from outside, and you must not come to a conclusion, for this closes the avenue to Truth.<br />
<br />
2. Love is the centre of the whole Universe, and from this centre a continuous flow of Love flows through every soul and through everything that lives. Through flowers, through animals, human beings and angels, this same Love flows continuously from it Central Font, for ever expressing itself and its true nature.<br />
<br />
3. Love is the affinity in the minerals, love is the essence in the flowers, love is expressed in the animal nature. In man love is expressed in affection and when fully realized the whole being is filled with it, and every cell in the body becomes vitalized.<br />
<br />
4. There is no other power in the world but love. It is the only true power in heaven and on earth for it is eternal and ever present every where. The alter will pass away, but love shall forever be, for it is the only presence of God.<br />
<br />
5. Theorizing on love is but mental aspect of it. To theorize on what loves is, is to lose it power. You are the creation of the infinite life which is love, and love expressed in itself in its true nature and understood and realized in this way.<br />
<br />
6. All great souls upon the earth are expressing this love in different ways in different parts of the world.<br />
<br />
7. Suggestions come from outside â€“ but you cannot understand the truth from suggestions hat arise from outside yourselves. Therefore do not come to any conclusion in regards to the truth, for the truth is unfathomable and eternal. I am ever present, expressing myself in my divine nature which is eternal.<br />
<br />
8. You must accept this, yet you must not come to conclusion of what it is or what it is not.<br />
<br />
9. Remember, this mighty power is waiting to unfold in you; you are the vehicle prepared by it; your soul is the vehicle through which it will flow.  To be conscious of this is the secret of the God - Man<br />
<br />
10. What is space? You are now learning the rapidity of thought transference which is beyond you and the mind which is influencing you. These thoughts know nothing of distance.<br />
<br />
11. Nathaniel asked, 'whence do you know me?', 'even before Phillip called you, while you were under the fig tree I saw you. Truly I say to all of you that from now on you  will see the heavens open and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of Man'.<br />
<br />
12. You have already witnessed this truth. All are angels in the making; your born angels; the angelic birth exists in you. This is the love of God. Some angels, now existing, arte those who once lived on planet or another.<br />
<br />
13. The whole universe is one complete whole, expressing the divine nature in love. Love is the holy cohesive quality, the only power that can sustain all things, and is bringing about its own perfection.<br />
<br />
14. There is never anything wrong where loves exists, for it is complete in itself.<br />
<br />
15. There is nothing that can interfere with the current of  pure  thought directed from life, for really there is no distance; the only necessity is a condition of receptivity,<br />
<br />
16. It is now possible to receive this wonderful gift of the father that is being poured out eternally. You can experience it for your selves by open yourselves up to it/ You do not receive it from the external, only know that it is eagerly waiting to express itself from the very centre of your being.<br />
<br />
17. You must become consciously aware of it, and, when you are consciously aware of it, then you will experience it in every cell of your body, in your surroundings in your friends, in your business place, your home- all can be filled with it. And there is nothing that can withstand it. It is so solid in its nature that it interpenetrates every single particle of substance that exists in the universe. It supports the whole universe, and it gives breath and life; 'I am the life and love'.<br />
<br />
18. All your thoughts of love and healing sent out even without any special direction are caught up in the stream and they help all. Remember nothing is lost in this world of thought charged with love.<br />
<br />
19. Space is the wrong idea; it belongs to separation, but in reality there is no separation.<br />
<br />
20. Let your hearts and minds rest undisturbed in the realization in the only presence of God. Even the child will come to know that there is no space or distance, for you all dwell in God and there is absolutely nothing outside God.<br />
<br />
21. By y own experiences I found that the flesh changes through the conscious awareness of the divine existence of love. It is the power that creates all things and attracts everything to it.<br />
<br />
22. For God who made the world and all things there in, and who is the lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by hand, neither is ministered unto by human hands, nor is he in need of anything, for it is He who gave life and breath to all man.<br />
<br />
23. And he has made of one blood all nations for to dwell on the face of the earth, so that they should seek and search after God and find him by means of his love and his creations.<br />
<br />
24. He is not far from any one of you. For in Him all live and move and have their being, and, as some of your wise men have said, 'all are His kindred'. Yes, when you have seen me you have seen the Father.<br />
<br />
25. There is no mystery about these words when you thoroughly understand them. The mystery disappears when they are understood.<br />
<br />
26. There can not be one particle of substance that is not of God. Every particle in the whole Universe must be of God, for it is God alone who is expressing Himself, and I and The Father are one, there is no separation between us.<br />
<br />
27. Now therefore, man, being of the family of God, is not bound to worship resemblances made of gold or silver or stone sharpen by the skill or knowledge of man into resemblances of the Deity. Yet when man heard of the resurrection of the dead they mocked.<br />
<br />
28. Understand that the great truth of the omnipresence, the omnipotence and the omniscience of God is complete. Know that it is He who lives, and he alone lives, in every living thing because he created all of them and He could not live apart from His creations, for he is omnipresent.<br />
<br />
29. If His creations were in any way separated from Him he could not be infinite in nature, He could not be complete in Himself. Every creation was created with the fundamental principle of love harmonizing every action, bringing into manifestation His Divine nature. And when man becomes aware of this Truth then shall man create in Himself the reflection of that prefect Divinity which will bring about\His Heaven on earth.<br />
<br />
30. And they mocked because they heard of the resurrection of the dead. Yet how could there be anything dead in the living Universe? How could there be anything dead in the Eternal Living God? Admitted there is a change taking place everywhere, but there is nothing dead in that change; very particle is a living particle which changes from one form to another. What ignorant Man sees is death, what enlightened man sees if the action of life. Ignorant man does not understand the law of transition from the one state to another, therefore man creates in his own mind the illusion he calls death.<br />
<br />
31. Not one particle of the whole Universe is dead; every particle if alive, existent in God. Every particle, even in its process of change, is a living expression of Life. And the fundamental principle under it all is the power of Love flowing from this Central Font of Love to Its smallest creations.<br />
<br />
32. Your sense-mind would cloud or hide the vision, the vision of the completeness of the which is Divine in Nature.<br />
<br />
33. But now you are in a secret place of the Most High, and He shall wipe away all tears from your eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things pass away.<br />
<br />
34. 'I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end; I will give freely of the fountain of living water to him who is athirst. I am in myself the beginning and the end, I am He whom the prophets have spoken of, I am the Lord, the Christ that dwells in each and every one of you, and there is no separation between us, yet you have placed me so far away beyond your reach'.<br />
<br />
35. In your own minds you have thought me unattainable, yet I am living in the secret chambers of your hearts urging you to continuously recognize me.<br />
<br />
36. This is the Christ that is born in the human family, the Christ that is born in every babe. It is the Christ that is eternal that lives after so called death. It is the Christ in you that shall live forever.<br />
<br />
37. Even as the rivers flow out and refresh the earth, so can you release that stream of Eternal Life into the alter. Then sin Spiritual Substance is alone substantial and is the only Reality that can be expressed in your personal life now.<br />
<br />
38. Your consciousness is the reflection of It, your consciousness in the material or physical or the reflection of this Eternal Life expressing Itself, and as you become more aware of It, It becomes more real to you.<br />
<br />
39. The brain, the nervous system, and the flesh of the body become filled with It. It raises the vibration of the mind to a state beyond your earthly existence. Yes, in time It will transform the body to make it that perfect instrument, for the Divine in nature is the only Reality.<br />
<br />
40. Use every opportunity to express that which you know. Let your Love flow out and bless every brother, every sister so that all of your divisions will be swept away by the oceans of Love welling up in human hearts and lives. When you bless a brother and a sister with this Love, in and out of your own being flows the Christ Life and Love.<br />
<br />
41. Do not in any way disregard the truths that are written in the New Testament. If  you express that which is true, you will also become true. Your true nature is Divine, let this nature become yours now, because now is Eternity, every moment of Life is now. Therefore remember not the past nor be anxious for the future; the future is taken care of, by your living now.<br />
<br />
42. You must all come to the understanding of the Omnipresence that fills all space, knows nothing of past, or future but is eternally present, the same yesterday, to day and forever.<br />
<br />
43. When you begin to know to know that all time is present, you cease to 'Long', you cease to long for things to come, and a great strain drops from you. How many of your are straining today? Because you are not living in the Omnipresence that is omnipresent. You live in a past and a future and miss the glorious expression of the Divine Life now.<br />
<br />
44. Peace will come into your souls, things that troubled you before will no longer beset you. You will not be burdened with things of the world because you will know that all that is mine is thine.<br />
<br />
45. Spirit is all power, and direct all things, but if you stand on the outside looking in, then there is no possibility of your ever partaking of the feast spread before you: but if you will come inside, you can partake of the feast now and there will never be any other time but now.<br />
<br />
46. When you gain this understanding, you eager souls â€“ who feel that you must accomplish so much in a given time â€“ will come to know that Love and service are pleasure and rest.<br />
<br />
47. These words seem strange to you at first because you do not understand them. To rest in the Lord means to be always with the Lord; and as the Lord is the supreme expression of the Almighty, knowing this, there is no fear, there is no doubt, and Life becomes a joy.<br />
<br />
48. Only when you are burdened with the cares of the world is there sorrow. Lift up your hearts and rejoice in the fact that your Father knoweth what you are in need of and has prepared everything for you; the table is already set. You can come into the feast now if you will, and partake of all that you are capable of; the only thing that is necessary is your capacity to receive.<br />
<br />
49. You will renew your energies and unfold wider avenues for further experience, with a sense of peace and quiet that comes from that which does not consider time or space as an essential factor, for It knows no time or space, being Ever â€“ present and Eternal.<br />
<br />
50. To live in the spiritual is to live in Reality, not spasmodically and in limits. How can there be any time or space in Infinity? Know that you live in the Mind of God that fills all space, for there is nowhere where It is not.<br />
<br />
51. If you truly know that you are the Christ of God that exists eternally and is ever â€“ present, the animating and Creative Power within the Mind, then there can be no time or space.<br />
<br />
52. You can reach  the state where there is no time or space and enter into the completeness of the Lord thy God, that dwells in your soul; the Lord is the only Power there is. I am the Lord.<br />
<br />
53. 'Love' is the eternal ever â€“ present and glorious Life now, which is a rest and joy, a satisfaction too full to make you look backward or forward when you know that Love is the ever â€“ present and never in the past or the future.<br />
<br />
54. Think over this carefully, so that your joy may be full. 'I am' the ever â€“ present Love. It was this Love that I saw so clearly. I knew that God was Love, and to be His son then I must be Love also. I found there could be nothing else for me but Love, and no matter what was done to me I still knew that I must remain the son of God, the Eternal Ever â€“ present perfect LOVE that knew no past or future, no sin or death.<br />
<br />
55. 'Lazarus come forth', was to speak from the Spiritual plane, realizing only the ever â€“ present Life. If you can understand these words, you will realize the Life that is eternal and ever â€“ present. You can also speak the word, if your consciousness can grasp the Reality of it, and what you speak shall manifest because it is created in the now.<br />
<br />
56. You are affected by suggestions that come from without, suggested to by the conditions surrounding you; you believe in death and decay; but in Reality there is no death nor decay, there is only change, and this is Life. If you could see this ever â€“ present Life behind all change and become consciously aware of It, then I say that every particle of your whole body would be filled with It.<br />
<br />
57. 'I am' the Lord, 'I' change not. Open your eyes and see within yourselves this mighty Truth.<br />
<br />
58. You can be just as much of God as you are prepared to manifest. Christ, the Son of God, in the heart of humanity reaches out to man urging him to awaken to his Divine Consciousness, for the Christ in each and every one is alive forever. These is eternal peace in the heart as you recognize this Truth.<br />
<br />
59. 'I am the Lord thy God. I am one with the Father, the Father and I are never apart, we are always working together in you.'<br />
<br />
60. The seven acts of Christ become actual to you now, at this moment, instead of belonging to a past period. The Christ experiences the birth of Life in the Temple that is not made with hands.<br />
<br />
61. The symbol of the Divine child in the arms of Mary, the Mother, is but the symbol of the Christ being born in every babe. The Father is individualized in each and every one, thus manifesting the birth of Christ the Eternal Son of God into earthly Life.<br />
<br />
62. Look around you and look at each other and say, 'From whence didst thou come?' Only the Father knoweth.<br />
<br />
63. The anointing is the consecration of the life to God. Then cometh the awakening of the Christ  in the Temple that is made by God alone.<br />
<br />
64. According to your realization the Christ manifests in you, so do you consecrate your life to God.<br />
<br />
65. Then comes the temptation. Temptation was in the world for the Christ to overcome: 'I have overcome the world'.<br />
<br />
66. The crucifixion means that everyone is crucified. All must pass through their own gates of Gethsemane; some pass through it one way, some another. Thus you are purified through your experience.<br />
<br />
67. The greatest of all experiences was that I could lay down my life through the crucifixion to take it up again, not for my own benefit but for the benefit of all who live, 'and those who believeth in me will never die,' for they have already found the secret of Eternal Life.<br />
<br />
68. Then cometh the resurrection, the resurrection of the soul out of this mortal body. The Christ is the Spirit of God manifesting in the flesh, the ascension is the true recognition of this Reality, the true realization of the Eternal Christ.<br />
<br />
69. The Christ is in you and nothing can avail from without; the evolution of the one Soul exalts the whole race, that they may all be one.<br />
<br />
70. The complete understanding of time as the only present factor, with neither past nor future, would remove false ideas and inherited ills. Only the good that man does has any vitality. Then cease to uphold the working-out of ignorance and sin, and things of the past.<br />
<br />
71. Most people's minds are overburdened with the power of sin. The ignorance in the world and the sin in the world are all they can see. You can not see the Christ through ignorance and sin. You can only see Christ through the Love of God; the complete and perfect expression of the Father of Love is His Son who lives forever in the present.<br />
<br />
72. I am the Son of God through Love. So also must you become the sons and daughters of God  through Love. In no other way can you become true sons and daughters of God.<br />
<br />
73. You are born sons and daughters of God because the Christ the Spirit of God is in you. When Christ is realized you will know yourself to be. Then the flood of Love flows through the heart that understands; this is beyond the conception of any human soul that has not yet awakened.<br />
<br />
74. In your physical sense you make both good and evil seem of equal power. This is but theorizing with mortal sense, it is not the truth of Reality.<br />
<br />
75. In God there is neither good nor evil, God is the complete perfect expression now. If you say that the omnipresent God is good and that evil exists also, then your reason is at fault â€“ how can evil exist in the omnipresent good?<br />
<br />
76. Your misconceptions cause you to believe that evil exists. Do not theorize, but allow the Love of God to express Itself through you; and you will find that which makes you fear, that which hinders your true expression, will dissolve away into nothingness â€“ where it belongs. Think, and you will see that it is in your own mind that you are creating fear and evil, for it does not and cannot exist in the omnipresence of God.<br />
<br />
77. Love is the only reality and is eve-present; then realize that this Ever-present is Eternity free from all conditions.<br />
<br />
78. Darkness is but the absence of light. When your hearts are full of Love there can be no darkness in the soul, for Love is the Light of the world. Truth is the search for the Light of the world;  'Love' is the first Cause, and when you find this truth you have found everything. As Love casteth out fear, so does Love cast out all that is contrary to the true nature.<br />
<br />
79. Fear is a thought-power generated by the self through luck of understanding and has the temporary effect of interrupting the flow of Life through the soul and body.<br />
<br />
80. Would you fear if you knew that you were the Lord? Would you fear if you knew that the Christ was your real self? Would you fear if you knew that God alone existed and it was He who was expressing Himself, and that you, His creation, could never be separate from  Him?<br />
<br />
81. Look at the Cross and see what lesson it brings you. Would you deny the Father, even though you were scourged and crucified with nails through hands and feet? Your only strength lies in Him who is with you always, who created you like unto Himself â€“ LOVE.<br />
<br />
82. Fear has the effect of changing the body thorough chemicalisation,  but to overcome these conditions you apply the antidote of Love, the only permanent power in the Universe.<br />
<br />
83. Every though, every movement, every action has a chemical change upon the body. You are continuously changing your body structure through fear and anxiety; this is inharmony. But Love is harmony and healing for soul and body.<br />
<br />
84. Love is the power that overcomes all things and is working through all Nature. God is expressing Himself, sustaining the body, the temple not made with hands.<br />
<br />
85. When you let go of your fears you will find that your God-nature will bring back the normal state of the body, which is harmony.<br />
<br />
86. Nothing has been brought into being except through the Christ. As John said, the Word was with God and the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh; and only through that Word did everything come into being. I am that Word, I am the Word of God, I am the Life, I am the Lord.<br />
<br />
87. See clearly this Truth in yourselves, knowing that which is possible to me is also possible to you if you will believe in me.<br />
<br />
88. Pease and calm come into your hearts when you know that you are passing through all stages of the Christ from the birth to the Ascension.<br />
<br />
89. Love is power and Life's true expression. Love pours forth from its fountain in one continuous stream and is the only power there really is.<br />
<br />
90. Love is the Life Energy passing through the body. Love is a passion of great power in the heart. Love is the protective agency in every living soul. Love flows through all planes of being; Love is the foundation of all Divine action and is the salvation of the Race.<br />
<br />
91. When you realize that this Love is within yourselves, then the mighty Power grows from within you. No power comes from without.<br />
<br />
92. Love pours forth from its Source in one continuous stream and is the only Real Power there is; the soul and body are sustained by it.<br />
<br />
93. It is the rapture in the heart, the protector of the soul and body. All Divine action is based upon the Love of God.<br />
<br />
94. All are subject to the Divine; the more you know this, the more like God you become. All are subject to the same power, for there is no other Power but the Power of the Infinite Living Life. Therefore the omnipresence of His Divine Nature is a Reality.<br />
<br />
95. Love is the only Power that exists in the whole Universe: everything is responds to it. Flowers, animals, humans and Angels all respond to Love's adoration.<br />
<br />
96. Love being God, It must be the greatest power there is.  Love harmonises everything. Love can not be separate from anything in Nature, for it is the cause behind all true manifestation, and will remain when all other conditions are removed.<br />
<br />
97. Do not think that the Father has left you when you find yourself in distress. He is making you more perfect, a more perfect instrument through which He can manifest His Creative Power.<br />
<br />
98. Ignorance has no principle in itself, just as error has no principle. Mathematics has a principle, but error can have none, for when the error is corrected it disappears;  therefore you learn that ignorance and error have no power of their own.<br />
<br />
99. The prophet wrote in Proverbs, 'My son, eat this honey because it is good, and this honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste; so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul, when thou has found it; then there shalt be reward and thy expectations shall not be cut off.'<br />
<br />
100. Love is the secret balm that all can use, the learned and the untutored, the wise and the foolish. It speaks all languages, and It is the soul's haven of rest.<br />
<br />
101. The position you hold in the world means nothing. What means most to you is your capacity to receive and give Divine Love, the true expression of God Himself.<br />
<br />
102. God is Spirit, and Spirit is Life; Life is Love; and Love is the vital force of all things; It is the harmony in all things; then we must worship in Love if we would attain a consciousness of  God.<br />
<br />
103. Idols and images are but symbols in the mind and we gain little from them; we must realize the Love of God. Christ is the Spirit of God, and has been given all power in heaven and on earth through Love.<br />
<br />
104. People are mystified by the healings that took place 2,000 years ago, but there is very little difference in the healings that take place in your midst to-day; the only difference is the fact that it may be different personality used. But it is the same Christ that heals.<br />
<br />
105. The Real is the Principle of Love. God made the Universe by pure thought, positive and creative, which is the expression of His nature 'Love'. Then Love is the union between God and mankind. This Divine Energy is the eternal link that holds us fast to Him who made us in His own image and likeness.<br />
<br />
106. So mankind becomes the vehicle for the expression of Love, and this is the true science of Living.<br />
<br />
107. As we gaze upon the Fountain of Love, God's nature becomes our nature. What I see the Father do, I do likewise. It is no longer strange to you now, that my thoughts become the healing power that changes the ether of disease and death to those of Health and Life.<br />
<br />
108. By the power of the holy thought your bodies will also be changed from carnal flesh to spirit form.<br />
<br />
109. All are sons and daughters of God by birth, and all become sons and daughters of God through understanding and Love. There is nothing so great in the heart of man as the expression of his Christ nature: there is no greater in all the world. By Love I heal, by Love I live.<br />
<br />
110. Through the understanding the truth is revealed â€“ that we are all sons and daughters of God; and from this point alone you become a greater civilization upon earth.<br />
<br />
111. The Love of God through the Christ must dwell in each and every one of you. Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and everything else shall be added unto you.<br />
<br />
112. And when you pray, believe you have received that which you have asked for, and ye shall have it. When you ask, ask in the Mind of God; it is the established in the Spirit, and what is established in the Spirit must come forth in form, provided you make yourself receptive to it through understanding Faith.<br />
<br />
113. You shall all gain your inheritance even in the darkness that surrounds you, for the Light that lighteth the world in within yourselves and can never be extinguished.<br />
<br />
114. We are all joint heirs to all that is God's when we attain to an understanding heart full of Love. 'Son thou art ever with me, all that is mine is thine.'<br />
<br />
115. Through my lips, to unawakened earth  comes the Trumpet of Truth. The Lord thy God is one Lord, and this is the Infinite Spirit within all mankind.<br />
<br />
116. I am the Light of the world; he who follows me will never walk in darkness; he will enjoy the light of Life.<br />
<br />
117. The Pharisees said, ' You are testifying to yourself; your evidence is not valid.' Is it not the same today?<br />
<br />
118. I replied to them, 'Though I do testify to myself, my evidence is valid, because I know where I have come from, and where I am going to â€“ whereas you do not know where I have come from, or where I am going to. You judge by the outside. I judge no one; and though I do judge, my judgment is true, because I am not by myself â€“ there is myself and the Father who sent me.'<br />
<br />
                                                                                  PEACE AND LOVE BE WITH YOU<br />
<br />
O Eternal Father of Love, we rejoice in Thy Presence. We know Thou art with us always, and we can never be apart from Thee. We are expressing Thy Life and Love. Thou didst send me into this world to prepare others for that which is to come. And they shall become Thy Angels to administer to others Thy Love. This is the joy of Life; let this joy be theirs, as it is mine for ever and ever. Make it their watchword in the morning, noon and night, so that they shall always be at peace. Even if ignorance darkens the light of Thy Presence, help them to see the Divine Truth: 'I am the Lord; I have been given power and dominion over all things.' Thy Peace I leave with them, for Thy peace is eternal, and as they seek it so shall they find it.<br />
<br />
                                                                                                            AMEN<br />

<br />
It is not about religion for that is a word made up of mans so called knowledge.<br />
<br />
It is about the process and journey one can take (it is choice) to find that which he/she is fully capable of. In understanding the essences of all that is in reality it opens the door to all that is not accessibly to us right now.<br />
<br />
I dont beleive TT is about moving mass after reading the posting you to omay find this i dont know It is your own realization of life for you to learn. I have merely rpvoided opportunity for those who wish to discover.<br />

</div>Let me put it this way. My words are not the absolute truth, but neither are yours. I personally don't believe in a higher power of anykind, whatsoever. I'm very openminded and I challenge my own thoughts on a very regular basis. Whenever someone has an idea or theory, I am willing to believe it as long as it is backed by facts.<br />
<br />
For instance, I found RainManTime's 3x3 matrix very interesting.<br />

		"articleBody": "I am the Resurrection and the Life - the Love of God.\n\nI am myself resurrection and Life, he who believes in me will live even if he dies, and no one who lives and believes in me will ever die.\n\n1. God is Love and Love is God, yet no one knows what It is â€“ we only know that It is.\n\nPerhaps you have been theorizing â€“ never do this! You must let the Truth unfold without suggestions from outside, and you must not come to a conclusion, for this closes the avenue to Truth.\n\n2. Love is the centre of the whole Universe, and from this centre a continuous flow of Love flows through every soul and through everything that lives. Through flowers, through animals, human beings and angels, this same Love flows continuously from it Central Font, for ever expressing itself and its true nature.\n\n3. Love is the affinity in the minerals, love is the essence in the flowers, love is expressed in the animal nature. In man love is expressed in affection and when fully realized the whole being is filled with it, and every cell in the body becomes vitalized.\n\n4. There is no other power in the world but love. It is the only true power in heaven and on earth for it is eternal and ever present every where. The alter will pass away, but love shall forever be, for it is the only presence of God.\n\n5. Theorizing on love is but mental aspect of it. To theorize on what loves is, is to lose it power. You are the creation of the infinite life which is love, and love expressed in itself in its true nature and understood and realized in this way.\n\n6. All great souls upon the earth are expressing this love in different ways in different parts of the world.\n\n7. Suggestions come from outside â€“ but you cannot understand the truth from suggestions hat arise from outside yourselves. Therefore do not come to any conclusion in regards to the truth, for the truth is unfathomable and eternal. I am ever present, expressing myself in my divine nature which is eternal.\n\n8. You must accept this, yet you must not come to conclusion of what it is or what it is not.\n\n9. Remember, this mighty power is waiting to unfold in you; you are the vehicle prepared by it; your soul is the vehicle through which it will flow.  To be conscious of this is the secret of the God - Man\n\n10. What is space? You are now learning the rapidity of thought transference which is beyond you and the mind which is influencing you. These thoughts know nothing of distance.\n\n11. Nathaniel asked, 'whence do you know me?', 'even before Phillip called you, while you were under the fig tree I saw you. Truly I say to all of you that from now on you  will see the heavens open and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of Man'.\n\n12. You have already witnessed this truth. All are angels in the making; your born angels; the angelic birth exists in you. This is the love of God. Some angels, now existing, arte those who once lived on planet or another.\n\n13. The whole universe is one complete whole, expressing the divine nature in love. Love is the holy cohesive quality, the only power that can sustain all things, and is bringing about its own perfection.\n\n14. There is never anything wrong where loves exists, for it is complete in itself.\n\n15. There is nothing that can interfere with the current of  pure  thought directed from life, for really there is no distance; the only necessity is a condition of receptivity,\n\n16. It is now possible to receive this wonderful gift of the father that is being poured out eternally. You can experience it for your selves by open yourselves up to it\/ You do not receive it from the external, only know that it is eagerly waiting to express itself from the very centre of your being.\n\n17. You must become consciously aware of it, and, when you are consciously aware of it, then you will experience it in every cell of your body, in your surroundings in your friends, in your business place, your home- all can be filled with it. And there is nothing that can withstand it. It is so solid in its nature that it interpenetrates every single particle of substance that exists in the universe. It supports the whole universe, and it gives breath and life; 'I am the life and love'.\n\n18. All your thoughts of love and healing sent out even without any special direction are caught up in the stream and they help all. Remember nothing is lost in this world of thought charged with love.\n\n19. Space is the wrong idea; it belongs to separation, but in reality there is no separation.\n\n20. Let your hearts and minds rest undisturbed in the realization in the only presence of God. Even the child will come to know that there is no space or distance, for you all dwell in God and there is absolutely nothing outside God.\n\n21. By y own experiences I found that the flesh changes through the conscious awareness of the divine existence of love. It is the power that creates all things and attracts everything to it.\n\n22. For God who made the world and all things there in, and who is the lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by hand, neither is ministered unto by human hands, nor is he in need of anything, for it is He who gave life and breath to all man.\n\n23. And he has made of one blood all nations for to dwell on the face of the earth, so that they should seek and search after God and find him by means of his love and his creations.\n\n24. He is not far from any one of you. For in Him all live and move and have their being, and, as some of your wise men have said, 'all are His kindred'. Yes, when you have seen me you have seen the Father.\n\n25. There is no mystery about these words when you thoroughly understand them. The mystery disappears when they are understood.\n\n26. There can not be one particle of substance that is not of God. Every particle in the whole Universe must be of God, for it is God alone who is expressing Himself, and I and The Father are one, there is no separation between us.\n\n27. Now therefore, man, being of the family of God, is not bound to worship resemblances made of gold or silver or stone sharpen by the skill or knowledge of man into resemblances of the Deity. Yet when man heard of the resurrection of the dead they mocked.\n\n28. Understand that the great truth of the omnipresence, the omnipotence and the omniscience of God is complete. Know that it is He who lives, and he alone lives, in every living thing because he created all of them and He could not live apart from His creations, for he is omnipresent.\n\n29. If His creations were in any way separated from Him he could not be infinite in nature, He could not be complete in Himself. Every creation was created with the fundamental principle of love harmonizing every action, bringing into manifestation His Divine nature. And when man becomes aware of this Truth then shall man create in Himself the reflection of that prefect Divinity which will bring about\\His Heaven on earth.\n\n30. And they mocked because they heard of the resurrection of the dead. Yet how could there be anything dead in the living Universe? How could there be anything dead in the Eternal Living God? Admitted there is a change taking place everywhere, but there is nothing dead in that change; very particle is a living particle which changes from one form to another. What ignorant Man sees is death, what enlightened man sees if the action of life. Ignorant man does not understand the law of transition from the one state to another, therefore man creates in his own mind the illusion he calls death.\n\n31. Not one particle of the whole Universe is dead; every particle if alive, existent in God. Every particle, even in its process of change, is a living expression of Life. And the fundamental principle under it all is the power of Love flowing from this Central Font of Love to Its smallest creations.\n\n32. Your sense-mind would cloud or hide the vision, the vision of the completeness of the which is Divine in Nature.\n\n33. But now you are in a secret place of the Most High, and He shall wipe away all tears from your eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things pass away.\n\n34. 'I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end; I will give freely of the fountain of living water to him who is athirst. I am in myself the beginning and the end, I am He whom the prophets have spoken of, I am the Lord, the Christ that dwells in each and every one of you, and there is no separation between us, yet you have placed me so far away beyond your reach'.\n\n35. In your own minds you have thought me unattainable, yet I am living in the secret chambers of your hearts urging you to continuously recognize me.\n\n36. This is the Christ that is born in the human family, the Christ that is born in every babe. It is the Christ that is eternal that lives after so called death. It is the Christ in you that shall live forever.\n\n37. Even as the rivers flow out and refresh the earth, so can you release that stream of Eternal Life into the alter. Then sin Spiritual Substance is alone substantial and is the only Reality that can be expressed in your personal life now.\n\n38. Your consciousness is the reflection of It, your consciousness in the material or physical or the reflection of this Eternal Life expressing Itself, and as you become more aware of It, It becomes more real to you.\n\n39. The brain, the nervous system, and the flesh of the body become filled with It. It raises the vibration of the mind to a state beyond your earthly existence. Yes, in time It will transform the body to make it that perfect instrument, for the Divine in nature is the only Reality.\n\n40. Use every opportunity to express that which you know. Let your Love flow out and bless every brother, every sister so that all of your divisions will be swept away by the oceans of Love welling up in human hearts and lives. When you bless a brother and a sister with this Love, in and out of your own being flows the Christ Life and Love.\n\n41. Do not in any way disregard the truths that are written in the New Testament. If  you express that which is true, you will also become true. Your true nature is Divine, let this nature become yours now, because now is Eternity, every moment of Life is now. Therefore remember not the past nor be anxious for the future; the future is taken care of, by your living now.\n\n42. You must all come to the understanding of the Omnipresence that fills all space, knows nothing of past, or future but is eternally present, the same yesterday, to day and forever.\n\n43. When you begin to know to know that all time is present, you cease to 'Long', you cease to long for things to come, and a great strain drops from you. How many of your are straining today? Because you are not living in the Omnipresence that is omnipresent. You live in a past and a future and miss the glorious expression of the Divine Life now.\n\n44. Peace will come into your souls, things that troubled you before will no longer beset you. You will not be burdened with things of the world because you will know that all that is mine is thine.\n\n45. Spirit is all power, and direct all things, but if you stand on the outside looking in, then there is no possibility of your ever partaking of the feast spread before you: but if you will come inside, you can partake of the feast now and there will never be any other time but now.\n\n46. When you gain this understanding, you eager souls â€“ who feel that you must accomplish so much in a given time â€“ will come to know that Love and service are pleasure and rest.\n\n47. These words seem strange to you at first because you do not understand them. To rest in the Lord means to be always with the Lord; and as the Lord is the supreme expression of the Almighty, knowing this, there is no fear, there is no doubt, and Life becomes a joy.\n\n48. Only when you are burdened with the cares of the world is there sorrow. Lift up your hearts and rejoice in the fact that your Father knoweth what you are in need of and has prepared everything for you; the table is already set. You can come into the feast now if you will, and partake of all that you are capable of; the only thing that is necessary is your capacity to receive.\n\n49. You will renew your energies and unfold wider avenues for further experience, with a sense of peace and quiet that comes from that which does not consider time or space as an essential factor, for It knows no time or space, being Ever â€“ present and Eternal.\n\n50. To live in the spiritual is to live in Reality, not spasmodically and in limits. How can there be any time or space in Infinity? Know that you live in the Mind of God that fills all space, for there is nowhere where It is not.\n\n51. If you truly know that you are the Christ of God that exists eternally and is ever â€“ present, the animating and Creative Power within the Mind, then there can be no time or space.\n\n52. You can reach  the state where there is no time or space and enter into the completeness of the Lord thy God, that dwells in your soul; the Lord is the only Power there is. I am the Lord.\n\n53. 'Love' is the eternal ever â€“ present and glorious Life now, which is a rest and joy, a satisfaction too full to make you look backward or forward when you know that Love is the ever â€“ present and never in the past or the future.\n\n54. Think over this carefully, so that your joy may be full. 'I am' the ever â€“ present Love. It was this Love that I saw so clearly. I knew that God was Love, and to be His son then I must be Love also. I found there could be nothing else for me but Love, and no matter what was done to me I still knew that I must remain the son of God, the Eternal Ever â€“ present perfect LOVE that knew no past or future, no sin or death.\n\n55. 'Lazarus come forth', was to speak from the Spiritual plane, realizing only the ever â€“ present Life. If you can understand these words, you will realize the Life that is eternal and ever â€“ present. You can also speak the word, if your consciousness can grasp the Reality of it, and what you speak shall manifest because it is created in the now.\n\n56. You are affected by suggestions that come from without, suggested to by the conditions surrounding you; you believe in death and decay; but in Reality there is no death nor decay, there is only change, and this is Life. If you could see this ever â€“ present Life behind all change and become consciously aware of It, then I say that every particle of your whole body would be filled with It.\n\n57. 'I am' the Lord, 'I' change not. Open your eyes and see within yourselves this mighty Truth.\n\n58. You can be just as much of God as you are prepared to manifest. Christ, the Son of God, in the heart of humanity reaches out to man urging him to awaken to his Divine Consciousness, for the Christ in each and every one is alive forever. These is eternal peace in the heart as you recognize this Truth.\n\n59. 'I am the Lord thy God. I am one with the Father, the Father and I are never apart, we are always working together in you.'\n\n60. The seven acts of Christ become actual to you now, at this moment, instead of belonging to a past period. The Christ experiences the birth of Life in the Temple that is not made with hands.\n\n61. The symbol of the Divine child in the arms of Mary, the Mother, is but the symbol of the Christ being born in every babe. The Father is individualized in each and every one, thus manifesting the birth of Christ the Eternal Son of God into earthly Life.\n\n62. Look around you and look at each other and say, 'From whence didst thou come?' Only the Father knoweth.\n\n63. The anointing is the consecration of the life to God. Then cometh the awakening of the Christ  in the Temple that is made by God alone.\n\n64. According to your realization the Christ manifests in you, so do you consecrate your life to God.\n\n65. Then comes the temptation. Temptation was in the world for the Christ to overcome: 'I have overcome the world'.\n\n66. The crucifixion means that everyone is crucified. All must pass through their own gates of Gethsemane; some pass through it one way, some another. Thus you are purified through your experience.\n\n67. The greatest of all experiences was that I could lay down my life through the crucifixion to take it up again, not for my own benefit but for the benefit of all who live, 'and those who believeth in me will never die,' for they have already found the secret of Eternal Life.\n\n68. Then cometh the resurrection, the resurrection of the soul out of this mortal body. The Christ is the Spirit of God manifesting in the flesh, the ascension is the true recognition of this Reality, the true realization of the Eternal Christ.\n\n69. The Christ is in you and nothing can avail from without; the evolution of the one Soul exalts the whole race, that they may all be one.\n\n70. The complete understanding of time as the only present factor, with neither past nor future, would remove false ideas and inherited ills. Only the good that man does has any vitality. Then cease to uphold the working-out of ignorance and sin, and things of the past.\n\n71. Most people's minds are overburdened with the power of sin. The ignorance in the world and the sin in the world are all they can see. You can not see the Christ through ignorance and sin. You can only see Christ through the Love of God; the complete and perfect expression of the Father of Love is His Son who lives forever in the present.\n\n72. I am the Son of God through Love. So also must you become the sons and daughters of God  through Love. In no other way can you become true sons and daughters of God.\n\n73. You are born sons and daughters of God because the Christ the Spirit of God is in you. When Christ is realized you will know yourself to be. Then the flood of Love flows through the heart that understands; this is beyond the conception of any human soul that has not yet awakened.\n\n74. In your physical sense you make both good and evil seem of equal power. This is but theorizing with mortal sense, it is not the truth of Reality.\n\n75. In God there is neither good nor evil, God is the complete perfect expression now. If you say that the omnipresent God is good and that evil exists also, then your reason is at fault â€“ how can evil exist in the omnipresent good?\n\n76. Your misconceptions cause you to believe that evil exists. Do not theorize, but allow the Love of God to express Itself through you; and you will find that which makes you fear, that which hinders your true expression, will dissolve away into nothingness â€“ where it belongs. Think, and you will see that it is in your own mind that you are creating fear and evil, for it does not and cannot exist in the omnipresence of God.\n\n77. Love is the only reality and is eve-present; then realize that this Ever-present is Eternity free from all conditions.\n\n78. Darkness is but the absence of light. When your hearts are full of Love there can be no darkness in the soul, for Love is the Light of the world. Truth is the search for the Light of the world;  'Love' is the first Cause, and when you find this truth you have found everything. As Love casteth out fear, so does Love cast out all that is contrary to the true nature.\n\n79. Fear is a thought-power generated by the self through luck of understanding and has the temporary effect of interrupting the flow of Life through the soul and body.\n\n80. Would you fear if you knew that you were the Lord? Would you fear if you knew that the Christ was your real self? Would you fear if you knew that God alone existed and it was He who was expressing Himself, and that you, His creation, could never be separate from  Him?\n\n81. Look at the Cross and see what lesson it brings you. Would you deny the Father, even though you were scourged and crucified with nails through hands and feet? Your only strength lies in Him who is with you always, who created you like unto Himself â€“ LOVE.\n\n82. Fear has the effect of changing the body thorough chemicalisation,  but to overcome these conditions you apply the antidote of Love, the only permanent power in the Universe.\n\n83. Every though, every movement, every action has a chemical change upon the body. You are continuously changing your body structure through fear and anxiety; this is inharmony. But Love is harmony and healing for soul and body.\n\n84. Love is the power that overcomes all things and is working through all Nature. God is expressing Himself, sustaining the body, the temple not made with hands.\n\n85. When you let go of your fears you will find that your God-nature will bring back the normal state of the body, which is harmony.\n\n86. Nothing has been brought into being except through the Christ. As John said, the Word was with God and the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh; and only through that Word did everything come into being. I am that Word, I am the Word of God, I am the Life, I am the Lord.\n\n87. See clearly this Truth in yourselves, knowing that which is possible to me is also possible to you if you will believe in me.\n\n88. Pease and calm come into your hearts when you know that you are passing through all stages of the Christ from the birth to the Ascension.\n\n89. Love is power and Life's true expression. Love pours forth from its fountain in one continuous stream and is the only power there really is.\n\n90. Love is the Life Energy passing through the body. Love is a passion of great power in the heart. Love is the protective agency in every living soul. Love flows through all planes of being; Love is the foundation of all Divine action and is the salvation of the Race.\n\n91. When you realize that this Love is within yourselves, then the mighty Power grows from within you. No power comes from without.\n\n92. Love pours forth from its Source in one continuous stream and is the only Real Power there is; the soul and body are sustained by it.\n\n93. It is the rapture in the heart, the protector of the soul and body. All Divine action is based upon the Love of God.\n\n94. All are subject to the Divine; the more you know this, the more like God you become. All are subject to the same power, for there is no other Power but the Power of the Infinite Living Life. Therefore the omnipresence of His Divine Nature is a Reality.\n\n95. Love is the only Power that exists in the whole Universe: everything is responds to it. Flowers, animals, humans and Angels all respond to Love's adoration.\n\n96. Love being God, It must be the greatest power there is.  Love harmonises everything. Love can not be separate from anything in Nature, for it is the cause behind all true manifestation, and will remain when all other conditions are removed.\n\n97. Do not think that the Father has left you when you find yourself in distress. He is making you more perfect, a more perfect instrument through which He can manifest His Creative Power.\n\n98. Ignorance has no principle in itself, just as error has no principle. Mathematics has a principle, but error can have none, for when the error is corrected it disappears;  therefore you learn that ignorance and error have no power of their own.\n\n99. The prophet wrote in Proverbs, 'My son, eat this honey because it is good, and this honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste; so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul, when thou has found it; then there shalt be reward and thy expectations shall not be cut off.'\n\n100. Love is the secret balm that all can use, the learned and the untutored, the wise and the foolish. It speaks all languages, and It is the soul's haven of rest.\n\n101. The position you hold in the world means nothing. What means most to you is your capacity to receive and give Divine Love, the true expression of God Himself.\n\n102. God is Spirit, and Spirit is Life; Life is Love; and Love is the vital force of all things; It is the harmony in all things; then we must worship in Love if we would attain a consciousness of  God.\n\n103. Idols and images are but symbols in the mind and we gain little from them; we must realize the Love of God. Christ is the Spirit of God, and has been given all power in heaven and on earth through Love.\n\n104. People are mystified by the healings that took place 2,000 years ago, but there is very little difference in the healings that take place in your midst to-day; the only difference is the fact that it may be different personality used. But it is the same Christ that heals.\n\n105. The Real is the Principle of Love. God made the Universe by pure thought, positive and creative, which is the expression of His nature 'Love'. Then Love is the union between God and mankind. This Divine Energy is the eternal link that holds us fast to Him who made us in His own image and likeness.\n\n106. So mankind becomes the vehicle for the expression of Love, and this is the true science of Living.\n\n107. As we gaze upon the Fountain of Love, God's nature becomes our nature. What I see the Father do, I do likewise. It is no longer strange to you now, that my thoughts become the healing power that changes the ether of disease and death to those of Health and Life.\n\n108. By the power of the holy thought your bodies will also be changed from carnal flesh to spirit form.\n\n109. All are sons and daughters of God by birth, and all become sons and daughters of God through understanding and Love. There is nothing so great in the heart of man as the expression of his Christ nature: there is no greater in all the world. By Love I heal, by Love I live.\n\n110. Through the understanding the truth is revealed â€“ that we are all sons and daughters of God; and from this point alone you become a greater civilization upon earth.\n\n111. The Love of God through the Christ must dwell in each and every one of you. Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and everything else shall be added unto you.\n\n112. And when you pray, believe you have received that which you have asked for, and ye shall have it. When you ask, ask in the Mind of God; it is the established in the Spirit, and what is established in the Spirit must come forth in form, provided you make yourself receptive to it through understanding Faith.\n\n113. You shall all gain your inheritance even in the darkness that surrounds you, for the Light that lighteth the world in within yourselves and can never be extinguished.\n\n114. We are all joint heirs to all that is God's when we attain to an understanding heart full of Love. 'Son thou art ever with me, all that is mine is thine.'\n\n115. Through my lips, to unawakened earth  comes the Trumpet of Truth. The Lord thy God is one Lord, and this is the Infinite Spirit within all mankind.\n\n116. I am the Light of the world; he who follows me will never walk in darkness; he will enjoy the light of Life.\n\n117. The Pharisees said, ' You are testifying to yourself; your evidence is not valid.' Is it not the same today?\n\n118. I replied to them, 'Though I do testify to myself, my evidence is valid, because I know where I have come from, and where I am going to â€“ whereas you do not know where I have come from, or where I am going to. You judge by the outside. I judge no one; and though I do judge, my judgment is true, because I am not by myself â€“ there is myself and the Father who sent me.'\n\n                                                                                  PEACE AND LOVE BE WITH YOU\n\nO Eternal Father of Love, we rejoice in Thy Presence. We know Thou art with us always, and we can never be apart from Thee. We are expressing Thy Life and Love. Thou didst send me into this world to prepare others for that which is to come. And they shall become Thy Angels to administer to others Thy Love. This is the joy of Life; let this joy be theirs, as it is mine for ever and ever. Make it their watchword in the morning, noon and night, so that they shall always be at peace. Even if ignorance darkens the light of Thy Presence, help them to see the Divine Truth: 'I am the Lord; I have been given power and dominion over all things.' Thy Peace I leave with them, for Thy peace is eternal, and as they seek it so shall they find it.\n\n                                                                                                            AMEN\n\nThe further books can be found at http:\/\/www.buytheart.co.nz\/pages\/Library.htm books 1 to 4 all learned and read will reveal all !!!",
