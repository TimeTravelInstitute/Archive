<br />
 power per pound<br />
<br />
<br />
a new standardized measurement to caluclulate a persons power.<br />
<br />
<br />
it consists of three tests: strength, flexibility and endurance.<br />
<br />
<br />
an athlete is given the tests.<br />
<br />
<br />
then the results are calculated and the athlete is given his power per pound rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
this will eliminate the need for scouts and will greatly increase the effectiveness of any<br />
<br />
<br />
 coach, team, and any sport in general.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
 Lessons:<br />
<br />
<br />
when a person can do something better than you, aknowledge that fact, then emulate them.<br />
<br />
<br />
 continue to emulate them until you understand why they do what they do.<br />
<br />
<br />
once you understand, you can elevate your own abilities beyond the average.<br />
<br />
<br />
once you emulate, try to think of ways to better it, then try it.<br />
<br />
<br />
 once you understand this, you will understand that nothing, not even fighting is physical.<br />
<br />
<br />
 it is all mental.<br />
<br />
<br />
once you realize it is all mental, you can elevate your mind, body, and spirit far beyond<br />
<br />
<br />
 human levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
you can understand the entire universe with this method.<br />
<br />
<br />
you can understand anything using this method.<br />
<br />
<br />
stay true to your morals no matter what.<br />
<br />
<br />
regardless if you have good morals or bad, if you stay true to your beliefs, you will<br />
<br />
<br />
never feel doubt, and the lord will favor you.<br />
<br />
<br />
 empathy is a good emotion because it promotes understanding.<br />
<br />
<br />
understanding is the key.<br />
<br />
<br />
once you understand something, you can see it.<br />
<br />
<br />
what you see before you understand is an illusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
what you see once you understand is the truth.<br />
<br />
<br />
pride should not be confused with ego.<br />
<br />
<br />
ego is believing you are better, pride is knowing you are.<br />
<br />
<br />
the man with wisdom also knows that great pride comes from great humbleness.<br />
<br />
<br />
you may ask, &quot;how so?&quot; you learn nothing without humbling yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
you attain pride through this action because you remember what you were taught, you<br />
<br />
<br />
remember learning your lesson well, and you remember wanting to make your teacher proud<br />
<br />
<br />
that they taught you.<br />
<br />
<br />
once you perfect the technique you were taught, you are proud, and your teacher is proud.<br />
<br />
<br />
later in life when someone below your level tries to defy you, you will remember what you<br />
<br />
<br />
were taught and you will feel compelled to teach the person a lesson you were taught.<br />
<br />
<br />
if they do not listen, then you show them why they should.<br />
<br />
<br />
prove your pride.<br />
<br />
<br />
show people how it feels to be on the top, and on the bottom.<br />
<br />
<br />
make sure they understand what they are giving up if they choose not to accept.<br />
<br />
<br />
edwin starr once said, &quot;war, what is it good for? absolutely nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
the truth is, when the spirit and the mind goes to war against each other, it is good.<br />
<br />
<br />
the reason is that it builds character, it ends any conflicts between spirit and mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
you must ask yourself, &quot;are we godless beings created by total randomness?<br />
<br />
<br />
or were we created for a divine purpose?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
the bible says people were created in gods image.<br />
<br />
<br />
we have all the feelings the world owns. hate, love, rage,compassion.<br />
<br />
<br />
so does god.<br />
<br />
<br />
people think he is perfect, yet we were made in his image.<br />
<br />
<br />
one of peoples favorite phrases are, &quot;people arent perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
to that i say perfection can be achieved for both humans and our lord.<br />
<br />
<br />
to do things with honor, pride, and dignity are the first steps.<br />
<br />
<br />
even the most wicked of souls are taught this before anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
when you die, you have no choice but to be honorable.<br />
<br />
<br />
laws in the afterlife are bound to your soul and there is no escaping that fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
that is why spirits attempt to harm alive people, but they cannot.<br />
<br />
<br />
the wicked cannot defy, and the divine cannot defy.<br />
<br />
<br />
the reason satan was granted the power to temporarily avoid this is because of an emotion<br />
<br />
<br />
 he once had.<br />
<br />
<br />
it was the emotion of imbalance.<br />
<br />
<br />
he felt things were done wrongly, and god allows this kind of defiance.<br />
<br />
<br />
he looks at it as a debate.<br />
<br />
<br />
for if you can defeat the lord, surely you are right.<br />
<br />
<br />
sadly, satan did not fully understand the lord.<br />
<br />
<br />
he did not heed my advice of emulation.<br />
<br />
<br />
he did not understand that emulation is the only way to the next level.<br />
<br />
<br />
instead he tried to force.<br />
<br />
<br />
the reason he does not understand is that it is not important to him at this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
he only lives in the present with no care for the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
for if he did, he would realize that things get old.<br />
<br />
<br />
you get tired of repetitive things.<br />
<br />
<br />
eventually even satan will turn from his ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
people will always want to try new things once they have made the decision that they are<br />
<br />
<br />
 tired of things.<br />
<br />
<br />
that is why the lord is everyones lord.<br />
<br />
<br />
that is why the lord is called I am.<br />
<br />
<br />
he is everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
he is you, he is me, he is satan, he is the holy priest.<br />
<br />
<br />
he understands us all.<br />
<br />
<br />
he chose to give us all seperate names, but together, we are, &quot;I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
do not let the illusion fog your mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
rebuke temporary happiness.<br />
<br />
<br />
realize there is something far greater.<br />
<br />
<br />
now, open your eyes and look at the world with new eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
ones that can see through the fog.<br />
<br />
<br />
ones that sees the amazing world that engulfs you.<br />
<br />
<br />
realize you are a part of it always and one day you will go back to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
understand the lord and he will suredly be happy.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
 The Tracks<br />
<br />
<br />
a wise young man and an ignorant young man walk down the train tracks.<br />
<br />
<br />
to the left of them, beauty.<br />
<br />
<br />
to the right of them, horror.<br />
<br />
<br />
the ignorant man goes to the left and the wise man yells out, &quot;never go to the left!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
the ignorant man says, &quot;why?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
the wise man says, &quot;you will find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
the ignorant man mutters, &quot;ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
he continues into the happiness.<br />
<br />
<br />
the wise man keeps walking.<br />
<br />
<br />
after some time the wise man becomes hungry, so he sits on the tracks and eats.<br />
<br />
<br />
the ignorant man crawls out of the happiness.<br />
<br />
<br />
he says, &quot;happiness has destroyed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
the wise man mumbles with his mouth full,<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;so now do you know why i said to never go to the left?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
the ignorant man says, &quot;i am not the same, i am wise now as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
then he speaks the words that make the angels themselves cry.<br />
<br />
<br />
he says, &quot;i filled myself with bliss.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;i had no cares.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;i did not care to eat beacuse i did not want.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;i did not care to do anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;i did not care to even beat my heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
then the wise man said to him, &quot;suredly thats not true, for you would have died.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
then the ignorant man said, &quot;the ignorant man did die.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;for what you see now is what is left.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
the wise men stood up and continued to walk down the tracks.<br />
<br />
<br />

 Tome<br />
<br />
<br />
people tell me my forefathers left me nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
they left me no land, no riches, no glory.<br />
<br />
<br />
these people do not realize that they are blind.<br />
<br />
<br />
what i mean by this is that they cannot see a thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
they are looking right at me, telling me this, and they do not realize that<br />
<br />
<br />
my ancestors gave me everything i am.<br />
<br />
<br />
they gave me my body.<br />
<br />
<br />
they gave me my mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
they gave me my soul.<br />
<br />
<br />
to me, they are greater than if you were given the universe itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
to the other, it is less than an acre of land.<br />
<br />
<br />
it is funny to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
i wonder how much they think their mind, body, and soul would cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
i wonder if i could buy them for an acre of land.<br />
<br />
<br />
i wonder if they will ever realize that that acre<br />
<br />
<br />
is only<br />
<br />
<br />
a<br />
<br />
<br />
grain<br />
<br />
<br />
of sand.<br />
<br />
<br />

awareness is the key.<br />
<br />
<br />
avoid complacency at all cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
what killed the cat?<br />
<br />
<br />
stupidity.<br />
<br />
<br />
it was curiosity that made the cat want to look into the hole.<br />
<br />
<br />
it was stupidity that made the cat stick its head into the hole.<br />

 Random Access<br />
<br />
<br />
dreams are a trip.<br />
<br />
<br />
nightmares suck.<br />
<br />
<br />
but even so, there is alot to be learned from nightmares.<br />
<br />
<br />
most people dont realize this, but if you see something, you have the ability to emulate it.<br />

 Prologue<br />
<br />
<br />
the man who deiphered the code looked in the mirror and realized<br />
<br />
<br />
that he is not the same man he used to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
he curses the code.<br />
<br />
<br />
he hates the code.<br />
<br />
<br />
life was so much easier when bathed in stupidity.<br />
<br />
<br />
he begs for the blindness again.<br />
<br />
<br />
he then realizes ____________ .<br />
<br />
<br />
then he realizes i am is his brother.<br />
<br />
<br />
baby dont cry.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
i hope that my dedication of three days will go noticed.<br />
<br />
<br />
i do not wish to attain fame, money, or women.<br />
<br />
<br />
i wish you the best of luck my brothers. may the lord favor you.<br />
<br />
<br />
the key to the next seven levels are included.<br />
<br />
<br />
it is time for ruthless to rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
this sentence is for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
  Amen.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
 Urgent &quot;Addition&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
which would the lord choose?<br />
<br />
<br />
the open book?<br />
<br />
<br />
or the vault?<br />
<br />
<br />
the answer is easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
the lord does not take chances.<br />
<br />
<br />
that is the reason satan is in hell.<br />
<br />
<br />
this is also proof that the lord is not perfect.<br />
<br />
<br />
think about it. then again...<br />

hi mr.ruthless hope you like this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rewrite this poem using metaphors and specific elements in natureâ€¦.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Male version</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>the mirror</b><br />
<br />
<br />
in the mirror i see a man,<br />
<br />
<br />
a man that wants to be a man this man has never seen,<br />
<br />
<br />
a man he wish he could be,<br />
<br />
<br />
if that man could really see he was really me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Female version</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>the mirror</b><br />
<br />
<br />
in the mirror i see a woman,<br />
<br />
<br />
a woman that wants to be a woman this woman has never seen,<br />
<br />
<br />
a woman she wish she could be,<br />
<br />
<br />
if that woman could really see she was really me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have rewriting the poem ask a friend to rewrite the poem as well and compare your true selves. Remember your unconscious does not lie and hopefully you use this poem to shape your life to live the best life of your ability.</div>

My friend, your post greatly disturbed me.  I tried calling you at home and was told that you've moved to Alabama.<br />

Please PM or email me at <a href="http://mailto:DarbyII@COX.net" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">DarbyII@COX.net</a> ASAP.  I couldn't find a number for you in Alabama and I want to talk to you.<br />

My friend, it's important that we talk.<br />

Stop worrying about &quot;You know who&quot;. Just post as normal and be yourself again and if you see &quot;You know who's&quot; post to you or someone else don,t read it. Just skip it and go to the next post. If &quot;You know who&quot; makes a habit of bothering you report it to mop. Also, watch the TOS that is how &quot;You know who&quot; gets you. Don't let a bully run you off. Other than that come on back to the group. Be yourself again. Don,t worry about it. Reactor out.</div>

Sound like you are channeling something<br />

I read some similar stuff about the lord<br />
<br />

in the Apocrypha.<br />

<br />
Interesting stuff in there(Apocrypha) which<br />
<br />
<br />
I read Ecclesiasticus.<br />

<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:44:50 PM  heather  carey  because you have no respect for me<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:44:58 PM  carey  heather  absolutely none<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:45:03 PM  heather  carey  and that is where our relationship is in trouble<br />

<br />
1/21/2008  4:46:28 PM  carey  heather  im not afraid of dogs...<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:46:41 PM  heather  carey  maybe you life is not a nightmare, and maybe whoever posted that phrase of they want their life back is setting a trap for little ole you<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:46:55 PM  heather  carey  maybe you would lose the life that you think is a nightmare<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:46:59 PM  heather  carey  and wake into reality<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:47:06 PM  carey  heather  that would be nice<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:47:17 PM  heather  carey  reality being this is not a nightmare but what opened up is something much greater<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:47:25 PM  heather  carey  i will tell you think<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:47:42 PM  heather  carey  without emotional opinion that you hold<br />

<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:48:33 PM  heather  carey  but the reason i know what the person was talking about<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:48:42 PM  heather  carey  is because i am a human that makes mistakes<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:48:48 PM  heather  carey  and i learn<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:48:58 PM  heather  carey  u dont have to believe me, time will show you<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:49:15 PM  heather  carey  and i guessed for a long time why i haven't told you the truth<br />

<br />
1/21/2008  4:49:16 PM  carey  heather  that person is looked at by the rest of the community as stupid and foolish.<br />

<br />
1/21/2008  4:49:57 PM  carey  heather  they usually make the same decision i would, they are smart, successful people<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:50:33 PM  heather  carey  the rest of the community goes out every day telling lies, living in a grey area which you say does not exsist-<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:50:50 PM  heather  carey  you say it is not good to work, they say it is<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:50:58 PM  heather  carey  you say it is not good to follow they say it is<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:51:06 PM  heather  carey  you say it is not good to respect your wife<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:51:09 PM  heather  carey  they say it is<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:51:14 PM  heather  carey  you say you live in a nightmare<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:51:17 PM  heather  carey  they say you dont<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:51:24 PM  heather  carey  who is lying who is telling the truth<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:51:32 PM  carey  heather  you<br />

<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:59:25 PM  heather  carey  and then we need to make a decision if we are going to end our relationship or stay together<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:59:27 PM  heather  carey  ok<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  4:59:58 PM  carey  heather  i dont need to read anything to decide that. that has already been decided for me by someone else<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:00:10 PM  heather  carey  i would like you to empty yourself of anger and read some thing<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:00:17 PM  heather  carey  please ia m asking<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:01:11 PM  heather  carey  are you a Christain?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:01:15 PM  carey  heather  i'd like a cheeseburger and a coke. and please im asking aint gonna make it pop up. yeah ill read whatever you want me to, but i doubt itll make any difference to anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:01:36 PM  carey  heather  im christ like<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:01:56 PM  heather  carey  are you a christian? do you believe Jesus died to save you?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:02:08 PM  heather  carey  do you believe the word of the bible?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:03:12 PM  carey  heather  i believe thats what he wanted, yes. yes i believe in the word of the bible, but you do not know what i mean when i say that. i do not believe the word of man. the bible was written by man. you do not understand what i mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:03:25 PM  heather  carey  we get in arguements all the time and one thing i notice for sure is how you use the bible to weigh my role in our relationship. you say i have sinned against you and i am the cause of all the grief, so i am asking for you to empty your heart of anger and read some thing<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:03:30 PM  heather  carey  ready?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:03:40 PM  carey  heather  sure<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:03:49 PM  heather  carey  <a href="http://www.bible.ca/f-husbands-responsibility.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bible.ca/f-husbands-responsibility.htm</a><br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:03:57 PM  heather  carey  i will go make you some thing to eat while you read<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:08:18 PM  carey  heather  I Timothy 3:3-5, and he speaks of ruling your own house. Now this discipline should be with love. Many times discipline is administered without love.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:11:31 PM  carey  heather  i read it, i wish i had the control over situations that a &quot;christian&quot; has. to me, its not so simple. i try to be that way, but i cannot. i admit to the lord and you that i am not strong enough to take it all in stride.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:13:35 PM  carey  heather  everything i do, everytime i have &quot;disciplined&quot; i was doing what i thought was best. it was not a rash decision. it involved alot more thought than what people think. i have stressed and struggled with it within my own head before it was brought to fruition.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:15:26 PM  carey  heather  i feel like, in my life, everyone looks at me and my way of life as wrong, and they hate me for it. but i truly believe i am a good person, and that god is proud of me and how far i have come. i know i have things about myself that arent great, but i have full faith that i will fix my problems. my mental problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:17:24 PM  carey  heather  i truly feel in my soul that i am not bad. i also feel that people wrongly judge me without thinking about everything. yes, i belive hitting a person for no reason is wrong. yes, i belive hitting a person for a stupid reason is wrong. yes, i believe hitting a person to make them see the seriousness is right.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:19:09 PM  carey  heather  there is only one thing i truly want in this world, and that is this: for my wife to be my wife, for my children to be my children, for me to know that that can never be taken away from me, and that we love each other and know that we are good.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:23:04 PM  carey  heather  if you stop and listen to who i tell you i am, and you believe in me, then i can accomplish all i ever dreamed. but if you do not, we can never flourish. i am honorable, and i will do what i say. all i ask is for there to be what that article states. you should reread it and see you are not doing what it states. you do not get off the hook just because you are a woman. a woman has to abide by the<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:23:10 PM  carey  heather  same rules.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  5:54:28 PM  carey  heather  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2031:10-30&amp;version=31" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2031:10-30&amp;version=31;</a><br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:28:40 PM  heather  carey  i did not say you are a bad person, i do not think or say you are bad. i do not think i get of the hook, in fact, if you would have read it and applied it then you would have seen where we both made a mistake. that is if you want to go by a christian doctrine. now, you are the one who got angry as hell at me when you thought i wasnt a christian. now why would you get angry if you can not be one<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:29:26 PM  carey  heather  did you even read what i wrote?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:29:26 PM  heather  carey  i do not think you are bad, i think that we make choices and dont always see the full outcome short or long term<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:29:45 PM  heather  carey  yeah so we have no communication now cuz you do not want to hear me<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:29:53 PM  heather  carey  you have to hear me too<br />

<br />
1/21/2008  7:32:07 PM  carey  heather  heather, that is the way i feel. your ideas are never thought out, and they are all around bad ideas. what makes you an idiot is not listening when i tell you this.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:32:41 PM  heather  carey  so, i am an idiot- trying to taint your thoughts. so, now all my thoughts are bad ideas because i do not think? because i am an idiot<br />

<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:37:07 PM  heather  carey  you see no good in me because you do not want to see good in me<br />

<br />
1/21/2008  7:37:28 PM  heather  carey  i never intentional set out to bring harm to you<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:37:36 PM  heather  carey  God knows that because he knows my heart<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:37:37 PM  carey  heather  when you mislead a child, you have overwhelming guilt. that is a guilt that i have. after such guilt, you never want to feel like that again, so you change.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:38:25 PM  heather  carey  yes i may not have been thinking of no one but myself, but i didnt realize and that is what i have begun to realize. you dont want me, you have not wanted me, you need to realize and truly think about it- why do you punish me?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:39:19 PM  carey  heather  this is why i cant stand you. fight bitch! fight until your last breath. and then enjoy that last breath, because it is your last.<br />

1/21/2008  7:42:11 PM  heather  carey  i am not a bitch. i am not a wife<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:42:27 PM  heather  carey  and i am going for my freedom<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:42:43 PM  carey  heather  yeah? freedom lies in the black.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:42:58 PM  carey  heather  true freedom exsists in the white.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:43:28 PM  heather  carey  you had someone once that was a real hard working wife<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:43:38 PM  carey  heather  the question is, what is freedom? and what is the correct definition?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:43:41 PM  heather  carey  she was honorable<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:43:45 PM  carey  heather  she was not<br />

<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:44:36 PM  carey  heather  she was never honorable, fo honor can never be lost without honor taking with it its life.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:45:06 PM  carey  heather  people give up their lives before honor.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:45:18 PM  heather  carey  i will not give you my life<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:45:28 PM  carey  heather  i dont want your shitty life.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:45:33 PM  heather  carey  you are unfair<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:45:45 PM  carey  heather  neither does anyone else. what a torturous life to live.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:46:05 PM  heather  carey  you want to take every thing from me<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
1/21/2008  7:46:25 PM  heather  carey  ?<br />

1/21/2008  7:46:39 PM  carey  heather  just one<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:46:50 PM  carey  heather  idiot...<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:47:01 PM  carey  heather  see how stupid you act?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:47:08 PM  carey  heather  see the idiocy you fall upon?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:47:49 PM  carey  heather  that is why you were disciplined, to not be able to fall back upon this idiocy.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:48:12 PM  carey  heather  it was for your own good, but you decided to turn it. for evil devious reasons<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:49:11 PM  carey  heather  i fight you so that you may have peace before you die. i know the path to peace and understanding, but you wanted to fight and turn my teachings into dishonorable garbage.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:49:54 PM  carey  heather  so now, that is what i am. i feel like garbage and you make me feel like my teachings are worthless. thank you for this burden.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:50:15 PM  carey  heather  if that was not what you were trying to do, then why do it? you can see right?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:51:19 PM  carey  heather  it says in the bible that I am the leader. not you, me. and if you loo, that is for a dfammed good reason. because we have seen what happens when you lead.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:51:55 PM  carey  heather  you lead into blindness. i lead knowingly into awakeness.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:53:22 PM  carey  heather  i try to help people see more clearly, i try to dust the cobwebs out of peoples brains, i try to make them think harder and further than they ever have. to see a bigger truth. one that needs you and me. honor. for it will die without me. and it will turn and wither from us.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:54:29 PM  carey  heather  i do not have as much honor in my life as i would like, do you realize this? i dream of a day that i can practice bushido fully and wholly.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:55:03 PM  carey  heather  i dream of a day that i do not have to fight for my beliefs. my god given beliefs.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:56:02 PM  carey  heather  i fight for good. if you see me fight, it is for good. i never fight for bad. period. i am good. i am good. i am good.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:57:30 PM  carey  heather  no matter how many times someone tells me i am wrong, i will not listen. when a person says something that i do not agree with, but know is true, i will not deny.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:58:21 PM  carey  heather  what you say is not the truth. it is a made up lie, in your head and out through your mouth.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  7:58:44 PM  carey  heather  and that is the only thing that is unfair about anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:10:58 PM  carey  heather  will there ever be peace? or are we headed for doom still consumed by the beast? -tupac shakur<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:13:26 PM  heather  carey  if it were not for me you would have no clue what you are up against that is love<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:13:50 PM  carey  heather  love has no chance against peace.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:13:56 PM  carey  heather  peace is wanted more.<br />

<br />
1/21/2008  8:24:22 PM  heather  carey  i thought you was just a human being<br />

<br />
1/21/2008  8:24:56 PM  heather  carey  children playing, mocking birds, and what it said about satan<br />
<br />

<br />
1/21/2008  8:26:06 PM  heather  carey  silly<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:26:18 PM  heather  carey  oh but i thought u were not christian<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:26:27 PM  heather  carey  so you are not religious<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:26:47 PM  carey  heather  im not, im a satanic devil worshipper and an anarchist rounded up into one.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:26:50 PM  heather  carey  you are a believer in God but not Jesus, so you are spiritual- studies of the old ways<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:27:05 PM  heather  carey  r u kiddin<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:28:04 PM  carey  heather  i am full of hate, driven to destroy that wich is made. that fits my character right? thats what you say at least and your just 'o so awesome. so i should believe in you and have faith that you are what you say you are.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:29:52 PM  heather  carey  i didnt say i was anything except a whore, and there are reasons i say i am. so, i should just drop this coversation. i was just wondering if you were christian because i was just trying to see what the foundation of ur claims r. bcuz if u aint a christian i wonder constantly why you would use the king james version- when there is hebrew<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:29:58 PM  heather  carey  ok i will talk to you later<br />

<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:31:46 PM  carey  heather  i dont believew jesus did everything right. i dont believe in everything in the bible. the bible tells stories of mens lives. you can see what they wrote in spite and you can see what was written from the mind of honor. i pick and choose, and that may be wrong, but i go by my own judgement, and the bible says to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:32:20 PM  heather  carey  oh and by the way, all that bitch wife [censored]- i could have had it down pat if you could have listen to some of my instructions. sleep, food, health and [censored] like that but no. you can help me take care of you- it is okay though- blame me, burn me, i will always try hard to see ur side but i will not always fight so hard here. there are things i do have to do<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:32:24 PM  carey  heather  p told me something out of the blue last night.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:32:59 PM  heather  carey  i think that is a good thing<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:33:07 PM  heather  carey  because i believe God lives within<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:33:20 PM  heather  carey  so u do okay with that and you will be alright<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:33:32 PM  heather  carey  i have faith in you i just dont like how youtreat me<br />

<br />
1/21/2008  8:33:41 PM  heather  carey  whether you are here or far<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:33:41 PM  carey  heather  he said self truth is one of the hardest things you can do. do you notice the change in p from 5 years ago? that is what your path always leads to. so go your way, you will return to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:33:44 PM  heather  carey  you will be fine<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:34:10 PM  heather  carey  self truth is the hardest thing i have ever done in my life<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:34:22 PM  heather  carey  and do you think it is easy for me to see me<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:34:33 PM  heather  carey  but i have my own opinions about this<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:34:39 PM  heather  carey  and i do not trust p<br />
<br />
<br />
1/21/2008  8:34:57 PM  heather  carey  and i have my reasons<br />

<br />
1/22/2008  8:33:26 PM  heather  carey  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22787261/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22787261/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  8:33:33 PM  carey  heather  is it selfish or a defect in creation?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  8:33:36 PM  carey  heather  that<br />
<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  8:35:02 PM  carey  heather  yeah, the reason you dont have diabetes anymore is because you starve yourself to death. i would never want to shrink the size of my stomach.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  9:00:19 PM  heather  carey  if some one says it is a flaw in creation, a defect wouldn't that be what the bible say lucifer's point was. that there is a defeat in creation and he can fix it. and wouldn't it be that we look inside ourselves to see if it would be that we are selfish? let's just say in general without what the subject was in the beginning of the conversation that was at hand. let's take it all the way to the<br />
<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  9:01:10 PM  heather  carey  very beginning and tell me what you think. we will call it together, light and darkness. so what do you think, is it that there was a defect in creation, or us being selfish?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  9:03:50 PM  heather  carey  yeah i don't really want to shrink the size of anything, surgically because i worry about if some thing happens and i gotta get that thing out of me. i worry if some thing were to break out, like war or a natural something. like tornado, hurricane, quake, what would i do. as i am, i can lose weight it will just take a while and a lot of work, with that thing in me i would lose the weight faster<br />
<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  9:05:56 PM  heather  carey  but if something happened and i needed to get it out. i dunno. i believe that if people need medical they should have it, but some thing tells me not to do it. i guess i just panic because sometimes the pain of the weight really takes a toll on my mental. u know. but then again, if i have it maybe we could all i dunno. help me. why can't u walk with me every day, i would like it, you need excersiz<br />
<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  9:05:57 PM  heather  carey  too<br />
<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  9:07:04 PM  heather  carey  u like ur body, and u like feeling it, i just thought that if i ask u enough maybe u would walk with me. but i have been asking forever now it seems and you wont so, i guess i just gotta do it on my own. i just dont like walking alone but some times we gotta walk alone i guess. i will be alright.<br />

<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  10:09:12 PM  carey  heather  take your time. take time to learn. you will never learn the secrets of the universe in a blink. it is overwhelming and confusing. confusion comes from speed. take it slow. when you go to fast around a corner, you confuse the car, and it wrecks.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/22/2008  10:10:45 PM  carey  heather  always have a skeptical eye, and a friendly attitude. then judge once all evidence has been collected<br />

<br />
1/29/2008  8:01:18 PM  carey  heather  to the barn<br />

<br />
1/29/2008  8:01:32 PM  heather  carey  that is all u mean?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:01:40 PM  carey  heather  yup<br />

1/29/2008  8:02:33 PM  carey  heather  i have no idea what you are talking about, and i have no idea why you are telling me thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:02:58 PM  carey  heather  You may be asked to swallow your pride and give into someone else's will today, dear Leo. This will be difficult for you to do. Try to concentrate on your good reasons for obedience, and take out your frustration by taking a brisk walk. Expect to receive some welcome news from another source, which will also help to calm you down. Relax with a group of supportive friends tonight.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:04:12 PM  heather  carey  because u deserve to be thanked, for being who u r and be strong through the things you saw and experienced, and being willing and able to hold on to your heart so that you could love other people instead of hurting them. thank you for teaching me things i might have not ever known with out you making it through ur trials.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:04:47 PM  heather  carey  do mine  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:04:52 PM  carey  heather  no need to thank me. its what i do, all i can do.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:04:53 PM  carey  heather  ok<br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:05:07 PM  carey  heather  The planetary energy makes this a good day for thoughtful contemplation, rather than action, dear Virgo. If you feel the urge to impulse buy, don't. Sleep on any purchasing decisions, and if you still feel the same way tomorrow, then go for it. Also, if you find yourself in the middle of a conflict at work, try not to take sides. Tell anyone who's asking for your opinion that you need time to thin<br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:05:13 PM  heather  carey  yeah but i didn't think helping was like that<br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:05:43 PM  carey  heather  think about it. Consider scheduling an hour of meditation for yourself. The key word for today is Zen!<br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:06:21 PM  carey  heather  you have corel draw?<br />

<br />
1/29/2008  8:06:25 PM  heather  carey  i didn't know that u had to be so inside to go outside. and i know that people are wirey sometimes and make their own mistakes including you, but you try to do ur best when u set ur mind to it... although there are still universal, celestial, heavenly laws we have to follow... u too yes? lol<br />
<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:07:46 PM  heather  carey  yes i have a trial version, i would like to buy it i think... it is cool<br />

<br />
<br />
1/29/2008  8:11:29 PM  carey  heather  if its so important, make it important. if its not, do what you do.<br />

1/29/2008  8:23:36 PM  heather  carey  Love bears all things, believes all things, endures all things. Love never ends...1 Corinthians 13:7, 8<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
1/29/2008  8:25:22 PM  heather  carey  so when i saw clay and his family and the fumes- i am suppose to understand what is happening, what lead to it, cause, how it effected the entire family, and place what i know and my scripture and apply for a bit understanding then dig deep inside myself for love and compassion but this doesn't mean to come up close? just do all this at a distance?<br />
<br />

24/02/2008  5:43:30 PM  heather  carey  for someone to say, the Jesus was lucifer trying to decieve the people. that has a lot of mind play in it. you could say the person saying it is lucifer trying to decieve the people. but this is not one persons belief, this is a congregation of folks that are tired of being hurt, opressed- they feel they have been wronged by the governement and they feel that the governement is killing us, and<br />

21/03/2008  10:33:18 PM  heather  carey  i was reading and it said if we eat a high protien with carbs- and any sugar in the breakfast the carbs with slow the sugar down and give us stready flow of energy instead of fast rush of energy and then crashing and the protein in the morning helps more than later in the day. so i thought if i could talk you into eating breakfast then maybe it will help you more since you are starting to work out<br />

31/03/2008  10:34:12 PM  heather  carey  actually, i am a wonderful person with a magnificent life. and i am into alot of different beautiful things. and i am learning all kind of things. i am not into conspiracy right now for my own reasons, and yes that is self and i belong there for now. you are into urself and what you like,a nd it is not right that you cuss anyone or call anyone names because they dont want to hear or read about it<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:36:07 PM  carey  heather  it is not a conspiracy. it is a link to the warning of the new virus. you know, i really cant believe you. i KNOW you understand how serious this is and what would happen to the world. why no. how can you just ignore this?<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:37:00 PM  heather  carey  how can u just panic like you dont have a brain?<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:37:10 PM  carey  heather  panic?<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:38:22 PM  heather  carey  i said i dont want to talk about the [censored], and i dont. i dont know why you dont listen. you expect me to listen all the time. back off about it, you need to think because it is a subject you choose to get all worked up about. what is that going to do? exactly what they want it to do. so you fall into the hole and i say rusty watch out and you are like shut up bitch i knoooooooooooww plop<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:38:48 PM  carey  heather  yeah?<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:40:20 PM  carey  heather  for your information, i, and i alone have already found the creator of the virus, and his methods.that is why i am so worried. i know who it is. it is a spanish man with the screen name darkalex. he is serious trouble.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:40:57 PM  heather  carey  ok<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:41:31 PM  carey  heather  he is the only person in the world that can fix a corrupted bios<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:42:30 PM  carey  heather  he runs a team called create and destroy.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:43:04 PM  heather  carey  i think it would be too hard to grow lettuce in the back yard, probably some type of onion, maybe a pepper, peas, tomatoe, i am not sure what else.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:44:03 PM  heather  carey  oh yeah and i found a spade ho that i can use<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:44:24 PM  heather  carey  would u like a cigarette<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:44:49 PM  heather  carey  catch<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:45:38 PM  carey  heather  ok, ill just wait for everything to go pooof. ill say no more to you about it. and when all you fuckers come running trying to hide behind me, i will move. there are folks who care and folks who do not. lookie at wich one you are.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:45:53 PM  carey  heather  have a great night. opposit o me.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:46:15 PM  heather  carey  i know i am, when i do not use EGO<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:46:39 PM  carey  heather  all you have is ego. without it you would be motionless.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:46:56 PM  heather  carey  no without it i would just be<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:47:21 PM  carey  heather  without it, you would not be. you will find out soon enough<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:49:00 PM  heather  carey  but it is not important about all that ego stuff, what is important is what i choose to want to look at right now. and i don't wanna hear nothing about all this mess you want to panic and run around and be all furious and violent against me about because i have already been talking to you. and you didnt want to hear me nor did you want to start preparing. and now i am doing the momma student<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:49:37 PM  heather  carey  if you want to continue to be angry about it then that is some thing you will have to deal with before it deals with you<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:49:51 PM  carey  heather  you are really, really slow heather. but thats not my problem. its yours.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:50:17 PM  heather  carey  slow. who won the race, the rabbit or the turtle bro<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:51:56 PM  carey  heather  the slow one didnt win dumbass. the point of the story was the rabbit was slow in the mind and easily distracted. from that statement i figure youve never even read the story of the turtoise and the hare. either that, or you are really, really slow<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:53:30 PM  heather  carey  i see, so get this- maybe i was making my point- but the rabbit doesn't have time to pay attention to the voice of the turtle because the rabbit is too busy. the turtle knows a lot because the turtle is slow for a reason and has time to focus on detail<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:53:39 PM  heather  carey  i am not the turtle or the rabbit<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:54:04 PM  carey  heather  i know, your one of these... <a href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/03/31/843926.aspx" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/03/31/843926.aspx</a><br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:55:24 PM  heather  carey  is that all?<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  10:56:13 PM  carey  heather  yes, that is all. it is a trait common in women you see. that is, if you actually read something else besides your own writings.<br />

<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:00:55 PM  heather  carey  i only like to eat celery, i dont do the veggie or fruit up the ass or vagina since i have released the need for pleasing other people<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:01:26 PM  carey  heather  lol<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:03:24 PM  carey  heather  you will find out how unpleased you are making your own self. you see, in order to get, youve gotta give. no, that doesent mean getting celery shoved up your ass, but it does involve caring. i know this guy that would be perfect for you. when someone dies, it matters not to him. when something serious is happening, he ignores. i think ill give him your email so you and him can hook up.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:03:36 PM  carey  heather  oh, youll be doubly happy too, he is an old man...<br />

<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:05:05 PM  heather  carey  thank you for caring ewnough to think of hooking me up with an old man though, maybe he will do fine on his own.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:06:11 PM  carey  heather  every part of the body is useable. that link was about as retarded as this dumbass person i know...<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:06:21 PM  carey  heather  name starts with a h...<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:07:41 PM  heather  carey  that is ur opinion and everyone has one. you are not the only person in the world and some people would rather read things that are light once in a while rather than [censored] they dont know what is what - but you have a right to your opinion. you should find someone else you enjoy talking too.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:08:23 PM  carey  heather  when it boils down to it, you aint got it cause you dont want it. so no reason for me to get upset. only thing i get upset about is your blatant disrespect, and not giving a [censored] about anything good.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:09:34 PM  carey  heather  in the end you will get lost in the shuffle. and the worst thing is, you know that.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:09:53 PM  heather  carey  good is in the eye of the beholder and not based on one man's or woman's opinion. and it is not being disrespectful on anything i said, i was being respectful.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:10:00 PM  heather  carey  ok<br />
<br />

31/03/2008  11:12:17 PM  carey  heather  your ass and tits get you in the door. your slow mind gets you out.<br />
<br />
<br />
31/03/2008  11:12:51 PM  heather  carey  uh... ok- go find someone with a fast one that you want to talk too then. maybe they will outsmart you and you will be happy.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />  huggs<br />

<br />
11/04/2008  9:40:51 PM  carey  heather  Sometimes &quot;[censored] IT&quot; is the only solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:41:06 PM  carey  heather  thought it was funny<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:41:26 PM  carey  heather  mine is bob dole loves bob dole<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:42:31 PM  heather  carey  that makes me think of pineapples, and i know you think i am stupid for being me and thinking like me, although i only know half the story. but some times being silly is better for me, maybe not for you. maybe that is some thing you need to consider.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:43:05 PM  heather  carey  i am not trying to put you any where, i am trying to be me. cuz pineapples can be funny associated the way i do.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:43:34 PM  carey  heather  i dont understand your point of view, but thats just me.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:44:21 PM  carey  heather  i also do not have enough information to understand your point of view eiither<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:45:56 PM  heather  carey  i believe in life, and tending and nurturing. i believe in laughing, and crying, and holding and releasing. allowing to breath, and unbreath. you can not constrict and confine, it takes away instead of adding. i was born into this world, my father, my God created me. he loves and forgives me. i say he because that is the language i know, and it limits so it is hard to give you information.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:46:52 PM  carey  heather  i believe in knowledge, honor, and the way of righteousness. we elieve differently. our importances differ.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:47:29 PM  heather  carey  maybe, i don't know. what do you want to talk about.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:48:17 PM  carey  heather  dont matter. weve been talking about it for years and neither of us have ever backed down from our opinions. except once on a riverbank...<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:49:18 PM  heather  carey  i don't want to go off stretch. i said i wanted to come in here, and you talk and ask what you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:51:03 PM  carey  heather  i want you to understand alot of things. none i can make you understand<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:52:03 PM  heather  carey  you started on me about bogan, you said that you wanted to talk to me to understand. so let us do this so we can do other things<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:52:59 PM  carey  heather  doesent matter. you wont understand. itll just be another &quot;im defending myself because im right, but i know deep down its sorry [censored]&quot; type things<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:53:30 PM  heather  carey  you are defending you because you say your right what is the difference<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:56:19 PM  carey  heather  the difference is this: in your mind, our relationship was great. then one day out of the blue, i just decided to hit you. in my mind, i said never cheat on me, you said ok and you said never hit me. i said ok. you cheated 1st, lied to me, met guys behind my back, then and only then did i break my promise, but i held alot back before i did, and when i did i showed a ton of restraint.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:57:16 PM  carey  heather  you make me sound like im just a horrible person. you say things about me that are totally untue. and it is wrong<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:57:32 PM  carey  heather  i defend myself because i am right<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:58:46 PM  heather  carey  ok so you are white and i am black. fine, i am wrong, i am the liar, the cheater, the stealer and all i have done is nothing for you. you were the won who worked so hard and deligently to make sure every thing went well. i hope and pray you will find happiness one day. peace<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:59:15 PM  heather  carey  gimmie a cig please<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:59:39 PM  carey  heather  that is correct, expect you did things for me. you helped me out in times of need. but only material wise. you did not ever help me mentally.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  9:59:59 PM  heather  carey  i did not?<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:00:05 PM  carey  heather  you make it out like i am jack the ripper<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:00:16 PM  heather  carey  oh...<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:00:20 PM  heather  carey  fine<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:01:02 PM  heather  carey  i do not appreciate you telling lies on me, even to my face, so i know you tell lies behind my back.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:01:20 PM  carey  heather  thats excactly what i am talking about<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:02:27 PM  carey  heather  it has been established already that you are the liar. and i tell lies once in a blue moon to keep the peace. i am an honest man. i try every day not to lie, and when i do, the guilt eats at me until i tell the truth<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:02:51 PM  heather  carey  if you say i did not help you mentally, well... i can not say i did or did not, you say i did not. that may or may not be true. i did not cheat first. but you say i did, so maybe in your mind and others i did, but in my mind i did not. i think what it is- you are telling me to bow, and admit to things that i do not feel is right for me to admit to, for two major reasons and then a few other reason<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:03:20 PM  heather  carey  you tell lies once in a blue moon to keep the peace and that is being honest?<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:03:27 PM  carey  heather  admitting to them will not change a thing heather<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:03:55 PM  carey  heather  you dont read so well do you?<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:04:01 PM  heather  carey  the way i look at it, is this- you believe what you want to about me, i know what i need to about me.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:04:22 PM  carey  heather  i know what i need to know about you too.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:05:25 PM  heather  carey  so what else do you need to talk to me about? what questions do you have for me? because i have told you, and this is false; the difference is this: in your mind, our relationship was great. then one day out of the blue, i just decided to hit you. in my mind, i said never cheat on me, you said ok and you said never hit me. i said ok. you cheated 1st, lied to me, met guys behind my back, then and o<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:05:28 PM  heather  carey  the difference is this: in your mind, our relationship was great. then one day out of the blue, i just decided to hit you. in my mind, i said never cheat on me, you said ok and you said never hit me. i said ok. you cheated 1st, lied to me, met guys behind my back, then and only then did i break my promise, but i held alot back before i did, and when i did i showed a ton of restraint.<br />

<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:07:05 PM  heather  carey  i think you are immature<br />
<br />

11/04/2008  10:07:24 PM  heather  carey  i don't like how you talk to me<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:07:31 PM  heather  carey  i have never liked it<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:07:39 PM  heather  carey  i don't like how you don't listen to advice<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:07:50 PM  heather  carey  when i say things now and back then<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:08:00 PM  heather  carey  so yes, i do think you are immature<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:08:11 PM  heather  carey  you knew better then, and you still talk [censored] about people<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:08:13 PM  carey  heather  your advice is usually crap. in my humble opinion<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:08:37 PM  heather  carey  your opinion is not humble towards me, only towards others until you find that they are not perfect<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:08:54 PM  heather  carey  perfect meaning meeting up to your standards<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:08:57 PM  carey  heather  i talk [censored] about people because its my opinion. i also tell them my opinion to their face, and i could care less what they think. they need to hear it<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:09:05 PM  heather  carey  and if they dont meet your standards you want to burn them<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:09:32 PM  carey  heather  if they dont meet my standards, i stay the hell away from them after i learn.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:09:35 PM  heather  carey  my truth of in the beginning are you ready<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:09:43 PM  carey  heather  sure<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:11:22 PM  heather  carey  in the beginning, you were too young, i didn't realize because i wanted to help you, i was taking away by you, and i also had a great desire to be a wife and have children. i didn't realize that you had so much to do, and grow into. when you came here, i asked you not to do drugs and i explained why. i also asked that your minor friends not come to the house, and i explained why. this caused<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:11:51 PM  heather  carey  alot of nervous tension in the house and lead to many outburst and fights because i was trying to give you room when my family was telling me to make you do the life thing<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:12:41 PM  carey  heather  your right, i was too young, too immature. well now i am alot different and you dont like that either.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:13:39 PM  heather  carey  i did not cheat on you, until much later yearrrrrrrrrrrsssssss down the road. but there were many things in the between. this is the point, you made mistakes, and i made mistakes you are trying to blame me for everything and make me feel like i am the biggest piece of [censored]. the only person who is going to defend me is me. and i am telling you, we were both wrong. BOTH,<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:14:58 PM  carey  heather  we were both wrong in the beggining, then i started to see what i was doing. i withdrew from my friends, i withdrew from society. i changed for the better and you kept going downhill. thats the reality of it<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:16:34 PM  heather  carey  i did not ask you to withdraw from society I ASKED YOU to get rid of the [censored] that was going to take our family away but nooooooooo it means so much to you that you got to cuss me, hit me, and make me feel like a worthless piece of [censored] because you can't come out of the jungle. meaning you want some thing else, not us. if you wanted us, you would hold us, love us, play with us. you dont want too<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:16:58 PM  carey  heather  we disagree<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:17:03 PM  carey  heather  forever<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:17:33 PM  carey  heather  2 different stories. wonder which story is correct. or does it fall in the middle?<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:17:37 PM  heather  carey  what the hell do you want, rusty?<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:17:53 PM  heather  carey  what the hell do you want<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:18:01 PM  carey  heather  i find it hilarious that you are telling me that my points are not valid.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:18:12 PM  heather  carey  stop putting words in my mouth<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:18:19 PM  carey  heather  i dont have to<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:18:23 PM  heather  carey  get to the point<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:18:31 PM  heather  carey  ok<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:18:35 PM  heather  carey  if you dont have to<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:18:39 PM  heather  carey  that tells me alot<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:19:06 PM  heather  carey  you said to me today, we were never married.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:19:12 PM  heather  carey  you said to me today i am a liar<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:19:20 PM  heather  carey  you said to me today i am a cheater<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:19:26 PM  carey  heather  my point is this, you are a weak frail bitch. you cannot stand up for what you believe in. i challenge you to a fight under the eyes of the lord, and i pray that he gives strength to the one who is right<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:19:31 PM  heather  carey  these todays were yesterdays<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:19:49 PM  heather  carey  you think i deserve to be punished? you think i have done no good works in my life<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:20:15 PM  carey  heather  i think the scale is tipped a little in the other direction for you<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:20:16 PM  heather  carey  in front of the Lord?<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:20:22 PM  carey  heather  yup<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:20:31 PM  heather  carey  challenge, i am a frail bitch<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:20:35 PM  heather  carey  [censored] you<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:20:45 PM  heather  carey  lets fight bitch<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:20:50 PM  carey  heather  lets go<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:21:02 PM  heather  carey  i am done withthis<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:21:31 PM  heather  carey  there is your fight and i am right because i have two kids that need me, and a mother that needs her own life<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:21:42 PM  heather  carey  you dont care for me, and you barely want to be around the kids<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:22:14 PM  heather  carey  i asked several things of you and each time i did not get heard and i forgave you, until i just couldn't take any more<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:22:26 PM  carey  heather  i dont want to be around any of you right now and when i find another place to go, or you kick me out on the streets with nothing, i will be gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:22:55 PM  heather  carey  i think it is funny how you call me a cold heartless bitch<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:23:01 PM  carey  heather  i cannot believe i wasted 8 [censored] years of my life doing this same argument<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:23:03 PM  heather  carey  i think it is funny as hell how you mock me<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:23:09 PM  heather  carey  i think you are [censored] halarious<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:23:14 PM  heather  carey  you dont like that either<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:23:36 PM  heather  carey  i can because u can not forgive<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:24:14 PM  carey  heather  i hate you and i love you. i look at you the same way i looked at my mother. if she needed me, i would be there, but im done trying to have a relationship with you.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:24:33 PM  heather  carey  i also think it is funny how you manipulate people to feel sorry for you because you are too tired to get up off your ass and work for some thing that is in your face and it aint even that hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:24:44 PM  heather  carey  so<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:24:49 PM  carey  heather  i dont want you<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:24:59 PM  carey  heather  i dont want this<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:25:06 PM  carey  heather  this is not what i wanted<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:25:19 PM  carey  heather  this is a nightmare to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:25:40 PM  heather  carey  i know you don't want me, i know you dont want this, i know you don't think i am beautiful or have provided anything good for you. so you are free.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:26:30 PM  carey  heather  i wonder how you felt all those times i proclaimed so loud that i hate this, and this, and you just sat there quietly knowing that was you<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:27:21 PM  heather  carey  you should be happy, i thought making things like a home, i thought being a homemaker and all this wifey [censored] would make you happy but you would rather be somewhere else doing some thing else, i thought that if i could provide you a place and give you things that would inspire you to go to school and give you time to work. well my plan was no good, and i am willing to admit so, it aint you.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:27:49 PM  carey  heather  i found out i am stupid when i do not know things<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:27:52 PM  carey  heather  now i know<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:28:41 PM  carey  heather  i remember being able to sleep on my stomach, that was so nice<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:28:45 PM  heather  carey  i tried to tell you, be there and all kinds of things. i even tried to tell you the truth about everything and you couldn't wouldn't hear me. you fall into the new world order and wont listen to nothing i say, so i cant make you. my hands are tied, i've prayed. i dont know what else to do besides make it over<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:29:06 PM  carey  heather  i think you fall into the new world order<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:29:48 PM  carey  heather  newsflash: everything after the point of [censored] bogan was fake. it was a lie<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:29:52 PM  heather  carey  so goodnight, and remember when you do find out the TRUTH- and i mean the real TRUTH- because you will, that i honestly did love you, and i tried to tell you. maybe i do, but maybe i tried to tell you and you just couldnt hear me.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/04/2008  10:29:58 PM  heather  carey  so, goodnight<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  9:59:45 PM  heather  carey  can i have a few moments to talk with you? on here?<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:00:00 PM  carey  heather  why?<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:00:28 PM  heather  carey  because you are my friend, i love you, and you mean a lot to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:01:39 PM  carey  heather  i dont care about your opinion of me, so theres really nothing to talk about. i am not your friend. you do not love me, and i do not mean alot to you. you need to quit lying. if those things were true, you would be a different person than what you are.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:05:06 PM  heather  carey  i do love you, we have problems and i can not fix everything by myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:05:35 PM  carey  heather  no, you have problems. my problems will be gone when i leave from here.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:05:48 PM  heather  carey  ok<br />

<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:07:51 PM  carey  heather  yes you do. you are so fake. and you are a con, not me.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:08:28 PM  carey  heather  you do things behind my back because thats all you can do. and your a sorry motherfucker for that.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:08:48 PM  carey  heather  you know how i feel. ill kiss your ass for this week, after that, im gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:09:01 PM  heather  carey  that is not true, goodnight<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:09:56 PM  carey  heather  how about you leave me alone? if you did, id have a nice peaceful life instead of this torture you like to give me. I AM NOT YOU. I NEVER WILL BE.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:10:46 PM  heather  carey  ok. i would like it if you would consider leaving a gift for brandon before you go, but i figured that would be too much to ask too<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:10:47 PM  carey  heather  you are hateful and you call it love. you are a sorry motherfucker. my life wasnt much before i met you, but i was [censored] happy<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:11:06 PM  heather  carey  well i thought you said i made you happy<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:11:15 PM  carey  heather  i lied to have peace.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:11:23 PM  heather  carey  ok<br />

13/04/2008  10:14:27 PM  carey  heather  you did, and do not care. i am a man. i do not have to take this. theres plenty of women that are trash and i didnt want to see you go that route. you didnt listen, so its noones fault but your own. i did things for reasons, you did things for greed. now you pay the price for greed<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:17:55 PM  carey  heather  i dont care if you think i am hateful, i dont care what you think about me. i love myself. i am a good person. this is your house and you create all this [censored] because you want to. you like fighting and arguing. i do not. you have wronged me too many times to even count. i did things to you in the beggining of our reltaionship and i atoned for them. you could care less though. go look at my first<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:18:52 PM  carey  heather  poem, and then go look at my last, look at how much i chaned for the better, now look at yourself in the mirror and look at the monster you turned into. your beauty was replaced with destruction<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:19:35 PM  carey  heather  you embrace the evil. you love it. eva is your hero. you are so much like her it makes me sick.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:20:38 PM  carey  heather  you need to take a long hard look at yourself. and the cold hateful things you do.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:21:11 PM  carey  heather  the president says hes a good guy too, but i dont believe the sorry motherfucker<br />

<br />
13/04/2008  10:24:31 PM  heather  carey  he will miss u, he asked when u r coming back, i told him to ask u. he should not have to ask, you should tell him when you will see him again, or round about when you plan on it<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:24:46 PM  carey  heather  i dont plan on it<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:25:08 PM  carey  heather  they will have a new father soon enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:25:52 PM  heather  carey  i asked him if he would be ok if you left because you had plans on leaving, and i didn't know when you would be back. he said he would be ok, but he wanted to know when you would come back to see him. he loves you and so does mary, mary says you are her husband. so, dont say mean hurtful things about our children, and dont say mean hurtful things to them.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
13/04/2008  10:27:30 PM  carey  heather  they will only see yours. thats ok though. i dont need them to see mine. they will hate me like i hated my father.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:27:42 PM  heather  carey  no they will not dislike you<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:27:56 PM  heather  carey  they will always love you, and they will know the whole truth<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:28:31 PM  heather  carey  they both are intelligent and forgiving. they will forgive us both. do you want some pizza or macncheese if we make some?<br />
<br />

13/04/2008  10:28:56 PM  heather  carey  yes<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:29:16 PM  carey  heather  your going to manipulate them into accepting things. that is all.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:29:37 PM  heather  carey  write me an email if you want to say any more. no they will accept it because that is apart of life. that doesnt mean they will like it.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:29:49 PM  carey  heather  you are going to use material things to get them to do what you want them to.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:29:53 PM  heather  carey  do you want some thing to eat if we make it?<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:29:58 PM  heather  carey  no i am not<br />

<br />
13/04/2008  10:30:06 PM  carey  heather  too bad bogan was afraid of me eh? didnt count on that did ya?<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:31:01 PM  heather  carey  i dont know what u mean by that fully, but i didnt ever intend nor did i ask him to do anything to you. infact i told him it would be extremely wise of him to stay away from you.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:31:08 PM  carey  heather  and you really thought it would hurt me like it did when corey did that? if bogan wouldve done it, i wouldve loved it.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:31:44 PM  heather  carey  that is all in your dramatic scheme, that is not what i was thinking at all. and God knows that. so i do not have to worry about that.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:31:50 PM  heather  carey  goodnight rusty.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/04/2008  10:32:19 PM  carey  heather  you dont know me like you think you do. you are so simple. you are easy to figure out. know why? evil is evil. it goes about things simple mindedly<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
13/04/2008  10:34:29 PM  carey  heather  my intent was to help you. after i was done elping you, i was going to leave. i had other people in this world to help to make it change. you knew i was going to leave, so you were greedy.<br />

<br />
13/04/2008  10:35:20 PM  heather  carey  there is no more point in trying to beat me down, you are wrong about me, and it is ok that you have your opinion. i was just trying to tell you, i love you, and i want you to be happy. and i know you will be okay now you are really more strong than you even realize. goodnight. i will take good care of the kids, and when you get ready for us to come, we will be ready to be there. i am counting on<br />

<br />
17/04/2008  1:23:58 PM  heather  carey  please pay attention to what i am saying<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  1:24:12 PM  heather  carey  please pay attention to how i feel with and about these things<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  1:26:48 PM  heather  carey  you there?<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  1:27:04 PM  carey  heather  yup<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  1:27:05 PM  heather  carey  u there?<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  1:27:36 PM  heather  carey  u have always told me that to the world i am fat and ugly. but to you i am beautiful. so why are you upset about that picture?<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  1:28:00 PM  carey  heather  you wouldnt understand<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  1:28:08 PM  heather  carey  because when i saw it, the second thing i thought was how comfortable and how much pain relief i would have if i could swim like that in water right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  1:29:11 PM  heather  carey  i would understand, because when people make fun of skinny people it upsets me, when people make fun of fat people it upsets me, but that is people doing it, and that is the difference. i dont have to make fun of anyone. doesnt mean i always like what i see, but i dont have to make someone else feel a lesser of a person.<br />

17/04/2008  1:57:25 PM  carey  heather  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24166011/?GT1=43001" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24166011/?GT1=43001</a><br />

<br />
17/04/2008  2:48:09 PM  carey  heather  i hope that you read it. when the samurai died, bushido died as well. who shall uphold honor and tradition in this world once it is gone?<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:49:16 PM  carey  heather  Born of two main influences, the violent existence of the Samurai was tempered by the wisdom and serenity of Confucianism and Buddhism<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:51:48 PM  carey  heather  it means that they were born into a violent world, in which they had to defend themselves with the same verocity. but, it was not the way they decided to live. the believed as i do, honor until death. wisdom is power. knowledge is honorable. knowledge brings honor. the path of the learning man falls onto the road of honor.<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:52:23 PM  carey  heather  Bushido, then, is the code of moral principles which the samurai were required or instructed to observe<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:52:34 PM  heather  carey  so if i continue to learn i will be following eventually an honorable path<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:52:40 PM  carey  heather  More frequently it is a code unuttered and unwritten<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:53:25 PM  carey  heather  you must want to learn first. you do not want that at this time. you want what you want. you do not see what i see.<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:53:32 PM  carey  heather  i see what you see.<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:54:04 PM  heather  carey  i want people to feel for me and pamper me and tell me everything will be okay,a nd it be true<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:54:57 PM  carey  heather  then you will never follow the path of wisdom. that is stupidity. do you expect pampering when you are nothing but a rotting corpse?<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:55:22 PM  heather  carey  no<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:55:59 PM  heather  carey  i gotta go take care of the kids, you want some thing to eat?<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:56:07 PM  carey  heather  when i muster the strength to save a woman from being raped by the world, am i favored? do i have something noone else does?<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:56:17 PM  heather  carey  yes<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:56:24 PM  carey  heather  In the world of the warrior, seppuku was a deed of bravery that was admirable in a samurai who knew he was defeated, disgraced, or mortally wounded. It meant that he could end his days with his transgressions wiped away and with his reputation not merely intact but actually enhanced. The cutting of the abdomen released the samurai's spirit in the most dramatic fashion, but it was an extremely pain<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:56:57 PM  carey  heather  painful and unpleasant way to die, and sometimes the samurai who was performing the act asked a loyal comrade to cut off his head at the moment of agony.<br />
<br />
<br />
17/04/2008  2:57:26 PM  carey  heather  The Bushido code is typified by seven virtues: Rectitude (?, gi?) Courage (?, yu?) Benevolence (?, jin?) Respect (?, rei?) Honesty (?, makoto or ? shin?) Honour, Glory (??, meiyo?) Loyalty (??, chugi?)<br />

<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  3:44:12 PM  carey  heather  depends<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  3:44:19 PM  heather  carey  and when i open the doors to try to figure out what is right for us all and what is wrong<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  3:44:28 PM  heather  carey  that is when it gets all confusing for me<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  3:44:35 PM  heather  carey  just like it does for other people<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  3:44:36 PM  carey  heather  listen to your heart.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  3:44:52 PM  heather  carey  but other people are not scared like i am and they are not so dependant on others<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  3:45:13 PM  heather  carey  so in my opinion you and the others i look up too have a strength that i want to have too<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  3:45:52 PM  heather  carey  but it might mean soemthing i dont understand and i may just want to stay me and not be what other people are because i might not be able to survive that<br />

<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:02:19 PM  heather  carey  so you are going to help raise them?<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:02:31 PM  carey  heather  the better question is are you?<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:03:21 PM  carey  heather  the better question is are you going to go after your &quot;needs&quot; or your happiness?<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:03:44 PM  carey  heather  will your &quot;needs&quot; even matter once everyone is happy?<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:04:11 PM  carey  heather  does your happiness depend upon your &quot;needs?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:05:26 PM  heather  carey  my needs are this: i need help in raising the children so they will be able to be strong individuals that love and respect themselves and others and be able to know the difference between prey, predator<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:06:13 PM  heather  carey  my needs are that i need to have education for my children so i can enjoy them being in my life - because it is the law for children to be in school<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:06:25 PM  heather  carey  i need food and shelter for my children<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:06:40 PM  heather  carey  and this is what it is about, the rest of me grows and heals as i go.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:06:58 PM  heather  carey  what i am asking us is this- are you going to help me provide for our children<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:07:12 PM  carey  heather  that is where we differ. my priorities are different.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:07:36 PM  heather  carey  i asked you what ur priorities were you didnt answer my question<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:08:42 PM  carey  heather  i want to teach my children to never give up, no matter how bad it is. i want them to never falter from their values, even in the darkest moment. i want my children to love life. i want my children and my wife strong and good first above anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:09:03 PM  carey  heather  even shelter and food.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:09:13 PM  carey  heather  that comes at the next step<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:09:32 PM  carey  heather  once that problem is fixed, only then can we worry about the next.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:10:12 PM  carey  heather  we CAN run ourselves into the ground trying to do it all at once though.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:11:19 PM  carey  heather  its fine if you dont agree, we will just have to go our seperate ways eventually.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:12:27 PM  carey  heather  if our lives are hell everyday, what does finances matter? why pay for a life of hell? makes no sense to em.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:12:31 PM  carey  heather  me *<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:13:05 PM  heather  carey  i understand what u r saying but i want to keep my children in our lives<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:13:22 PM  carey  heather  me too. you think im saying something else i guess..<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:13:40 PM  heather  carey  and if we dont have a home because we are kicked out on the street we can get all kind of charges and if people want to do that they can make it where we would not get to see them<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:14:07 PM  carey  heather  if it happens it happens. we cann only do our best and try.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:14:16 PM  heather  carey  ok<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:14:36 PM  carey  heather  if that is our destiny, nothing will change it, even worrying.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:15:09 PM  carey  heather  determination, and strength will be the only thing to rule the day.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:15:16 PM  carey  heather  if you ask me, that is.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:15:24 PM  carey  heather   <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /><br />

25/04/2008  4:25:33 PM  heather  carey  with a passion<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
25/04/2008  4:26:18 PM  carey  heather  why does your mother hate me so much? what did i do to her?<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:26:38 PM  heather  carey  she said because you do not care to help take care of bills and responsibilities<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:26:52 PM  carey  heather  funny how things change.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:27:01 PM  heather  carey  she said you dont care for working, your lazy, and if you wanted to care for the kids you would go out and find a job<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:27:10 PM  heather  carey  what do you mean now?<br />

<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:29:03 PM  heather  carey  you asked me why she dislikes you- and that is not all she thinks<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:29:17 PM  heather  carey  i am asking you and saying some thing different but you dont listen<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:29:28 PM  carey  heather  ive heard the biggest positive about me from her, and i have heard the worst.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:30:33 PM  heather  carey  it is not being babied, i am asking for help from the people who have a responsibility in helping. you are not hired helped and neither is my mother<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:30:53 PM  heather  carey  it is more your responsibility to help me care and love our children than it is my mothers<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:31:17 PM  heather  carey  and some times that means sacraficing and working so we can have a home so DHS doesn't come and take them away<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:31:20 PM  carey  heather  i find this conversation demeaning.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:31:36 PM  heather  carey  you find it demeaning because i told you what she thinks?<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:32:36 PM  carey  heather  no, i find it demeaning that i get looked at in a certain way for dealing with other peoples problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
25/04/2008  4:32:45 PM  heather  carey  i find it demeaning when you tell me i am a piece of [censored] because i wont go and get you a cigarette or some thing else as soon as i just sat down after caring for the children all day long. or how you call me a stupid ugly bitch because i dont want to do some thing or some thing or some thing i am not being demeaning to you, you asked me a question and i answered it<br />
<br />
<br />

25/04/2008  4:41:39 PM  carey  heather  i am obviously burdening everyone unwantingly, so it looks best if i leave.<br />

So if they were in the middle of an argument, they could look at the painting and say, &quot;Oh, stop. Whatever it was, whatever you said, forget it,&quot; and go to bed with a twinkle in their eyes.<br />

<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:39:36 AM  carey  heather  this isnt. the link i gave you is.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:39:50 AM  heather  carey  oh<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:46:23 AM  heather  carey  So oddly enough (given that this is the time travel institute), what the facts of thermodynamic entropy tells us is that, in order to reach higher levels of perfection, we MUST go BACKWARDS IN TIME to achieve it. We can never achieve a &quot;universal perfection&quot; moving forward...at least in this pocket universe, with the laws of physics that are demonstrably true.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:46:54 AM  heather  carey  Perfection is like infinity. It is not a number you can quantify. It is merely an ideal you can strive for, but never reach. Sorry ruthless, science is not on your side at all in this argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:46:55 AM  carey  heather  i disagree. it makes no sense at all to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:47:09 AM  carey  heather  doesent to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:47:18 AM  heather  carey  Perfection is like infinity. It is not a number you can quantify. It is merely an ideal you can strive for, but never reach. Sorry ruthless, science is not on your side at all in this argument<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:47:31 AM  heather  carey  Sorry ruthless, science is not on your side at all in this argument<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:47:45 AM  carey  heather  yeah, he doesent realize alot of things<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:47:55 AM  carey  heather  its all in his perception of the word<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:48:01 AM  carey  heather  wich is incorrect.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:48:02 AM  heather  carey  perfection can be achieved through randomness.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:48:07 AM  carey  heather  aye<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:48:40 AM  heather  carey  but i dont think science says any of this stuff yall are talking about but i guess people have to put a lable on some thing they dont know how to explain<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:49:00 AM  carey  heather  there are alot of theories involving this, read on.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:49:45 AM  heather  carey  life and death is perfect<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:50:51 AM  heather  carey  death is the culmination of imperfection== i believe it is the other way around, that death is the culmincation of perfection because you are released.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:51:38 AM  heather  carey  but u know what i will leave the scifi talk to you guys because i like arguing and when yall say tomatoe i am going to say corvette  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:52:07 AM  carey  heather  i believe the action of death is perfect, and so is the human. before and after. a big reason of my change in behavior.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:55:48 AM  heather  carey  i wouldnt want them to be that uncomfortable though<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:56:08 AM  carey  heather  comfort is irrelevant<br />

13/05/2008  1:56:25 AM  heather  carey  because some people that come from that line may not be able to survive the first day out of pure emotion would drive them just so uncomfortable and<br />

<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  1:58:45 AM  heather  carey  it just made me sad when i envisionsed one of them more well off people homeless, and how i felt when i walked, and how they would feel. it would be way harder for them to survive than it was for you babe<br />

13/05/2008  11:52:13 PM  heather  carey  rusty the way you talk to me, demand things of me, and disrespect my feelings, thoughts, dreams, wants, and needs - the way you treat me, is not how i want, or need to be treated.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  11:52:28 PM  carey  heather  ditto<br />

<br />
13/05/2008  11:52:34 PM  heather  carey  in other words, just don't say nothing else to me<br />

13/05/2008  11:52:42 PM  carey  heather  keep it to yourself. i dont want to hear it.<br />
<br />
<br />
13/05/2008  11:57:33 PM  carey  heather  all i wanted was a sleeping pill. all you had to do was say no instead of being a greedy liar. it is cool though. i hope you get further with your new boyfriend your over there typing away to.<br />
<br />
<br />
14/05/2008  12:05:54 AM  heather  carey  i dont like taking SERIQUIL, i threw what i had left away. because the drug is no good. you are sabotaging, you should know better.<br />

<br />
14/06/2008  10:42:54 PM  heather  carey  ok<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:46:17 PM  carey  heather  wutup?<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:47:12 PM  heather  carey  i was reading some news, and you know how the police will set up undercover things when they get information about someone hiring or putting a contract out on someone life and the police will go undercover and pretend to be the contract killer?<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:47:24 PM  carey  heather  yop<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:47:28 PM  carey  heather  yup<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:47:30 PM  heather  carey  well the women that got caught doing this, it is scary<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:47:44 PM  carey  heather  yup<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:47:54 PM  heather  carey  they look like some people we know and that act like they would not ever do such a thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:48:00 PM  carey  heather  yup<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:48:02 PM  heather  carey  wanna see<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:48:03 PM  carey  heather  funny eh?<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:48:19 PM  carey  heather  already seen<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:48:30 PM  heather  carey  yeah, there was this one woman that looked like that woman that you tried to teach a lesson too at the lake<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:48:37 PM  carey  heather  i know<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:49:26 PM  carey  heather  some folks get it, some folks dont. the ones that dont get it, its easy to see how stupid they are. rats have more complex thoughts<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:49:36 PM  heather  carey  and she was a prison gaurd that had fallen in love with a prisoner and he ratted her out which is good. but that was scary because now that i think about it, i see that how that woman that you were dealing with probably wanted to do some things to her own husband.<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:49:56 PM  carey  heather  yup...<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:50:35 PM  carey  heather  you waste alot of time. you wouldve seen it that day if you cared and paid attention<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:50:40 PM  heather  carey  these things are just . i am speechless<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:51:11 PM  heather  carey  nah i didnt see it and i wouldnt have seen it because these types of things did not ever cross my mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:51:28 PM  carey  heather  you only have so much time to figure the world out before you leave. you better get on the ball.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:51:38 PM  heather  carey  the only time i ever thought a woman would hurt a man like that is when Ava started trying to talk to me about it, and i told her no.<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:52:15 PM  carey  heather  its every woman and every man, including you and me. the difference is, some follow through, some think.<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:52:53 PM  heather  carey  no, some follow, some think, and some choose to live and let live and that is me live and let live and try my best to get over my retardation<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:53:06 PM  carey  heather  that goes into the thinking column...<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:55:11 PM  carey  heather  its like this, i say, &quot;do you know how easy it is for me to kill you?&quot; then you go back and tell other people, &quot;rusty told me it would be easy for him to kill me.&quot; the whole time you shouldve thought inside your head, &quot;why is it so easy for him to kill me?&quot; instead of, &quot;rusty thinks he can kill me easily.&quot; this is a parable.<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:56:30 PM  carey  heather  the meaning of the parable is, &quot;see what you cannot see.&quot; feel things, therefore you will know. i do not overstep my boundaries because i feel what i can and cannot do. i feel it, nothing more.<br />
<br />
<br />
15/06/2008  11:57:35 PM  carey  heather  i do not think when i answer, i just answer. people do not wait for me to think, i just answer. why? because i know. i feel. it did not come overnight. i had to train in all 3 areas.<br />
<br />
<br />
16/06/2008  12:00:00 AM  carey  heather  maybe you will understand once you put some things together. you have everything you need to put it together though. once you do, there are much more exciting things to learn. you just have to get over this block first. read my statements again with no thought, no emotion. do not think, that is your fault. just go around the wall if you cannot make it over it. there is still many walls to climb<br />
<br />
<br />
16/06/2008  12:00:41 AM  carey  heather  and you need to get past this first wall. its about to fall down anyways and you will never be able to scale it. what will you do once it falls?<br />
<br />
<br />
16/06/2008  12:08:52 AM  heather  carey  you got mail<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
16/06/2008  12:25:43 AM  carey  heather  k<br />
<br />
<br />
16/06/2008  1:10:13 AM  carey  heather  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui1h3cT-Wmw&amp;feature=related" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui1h3cT-Wmw&amp;feature=related</a><br />
<br />
<br />
16/06/2008  2:30:53 AM  heather  carey  i thought this was a cool idea<br />
<br />
<br />
16/06/2008  2:31:24 AM  heather  carey  Keep a journal together. Take turns each week writing down your experiences and the feelings you want to share. Write letters to each other in the journal or make drawings. This is a creative way to use your imaginations together and create something that will last forever -- like your relationship, hopefully. A perfect activity for couples who are extra busy or travel a lot, journal writing is<br />
<br />
<br />
16/06/2008  2:31:26 AM  heather  carey  also a way to express yourself to your partner in unusual ways. Select a journal together by shopping at art stores, bookshops, or specialty boutiques<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:35:03 PM  heather  carey  i am trying to study very hard positive things that will help me fight this negative force that i have created and surrounded myself with, and there are people who say they love me that realize i am growing that do not love me because i am not as dumb as they want me to be. and if they ever knew before that i wasn't dumb they would have not talked with me they way they did<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:35:38 PM  heather  carey  so i am at a crucial point in my life and you can go along for the ride and support me and understand that i am trying to do good, or you can make it harder for the both of us<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:36:06 PM  heather  carey  now spiritually you know what is happening. so let it be and let me do what i need to do within myself so i can prepare and protect my mind, heart,body and soul<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:36:53 PM  heather  carey  i am here, in our room, studying positive light work, listening to positive reinforcement, light and dark work at the same time<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:37:04 PM  heather  carey  and what happened today was a double whammy<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:38:15 PM  heather  carey  and it would take a lot to try and explain every aspect of today. but the more you get personal and upset the worse it would be for the both of us. you have to remain calm to, i could have kept it a secret but i wanted you to know what was going on. i invited you to know, so you could understand because i respect you. and i think you are intune to things because i think you felt some thing coming<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:38:16 PM  carey  heather  have you ever noticed that every curveball in life hasnt affected me in a negative way?<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:39:16 PM  heather  carey  anyway i need to get back to my studies right now, i am busy rusty. please give me some respect, listening to this audio file is helping me calm down. ok? do you understand if you don't find just please respect that it is helping me calm down and get out of an ill mood.<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:39:23 PM  carey  heather  i am a good father. i am proud of that. i am also proud that you know i am a good father and that you chose me to be their father<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:39:32 PM  heather  carey   <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:39:51 PM  heather  carey  huggs<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:40:03 PM  heather  carey  can u give me a kiss on my eye it hurts really bad<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:40:16 PM  carey  heather  maybe...<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:41:33 PM  carey  heather  i love you, thats why im still here.<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:41:56 PM  heather  carey  she was more than tipsy, she was feeling really good, slurring a bit<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:42:34 PM  heather  carey  she thinks i am retarded<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:42:43 PM  carey  heather  yeah, i know. the conversation was probably a bit different than our conversation, but its ok if you dont want to talk about it<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:43:00 PM  heather  carey  she really thinks there is some thing wrong with me, like i am retarded, she thinks this.<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:43:04 PM  carey  heather  it just upsets me a little bit. i'd like to be able to not worry about it<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:43:16 PM  heather  carey  i am telling you the whole conversation<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:43:33 PM  carey  heather  maybe one day i wont have to worry about things like that anymore<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:44:01 PM  heather  carey  the reason is because i just dont cuss her out, or shower her with love, i try and remain neutral and see what she wants to tell me, and i try to figure why she tells me.<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:44:18 PM  carey  heather  were you rude to her?<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:45:16 PM  carey  heather  seems like she was trying to bother you<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:45:27 PM  heather  carey  she thinks i am lesser, i can tell how she was talking with me, it wasn't what she said it was how she said it there were tones. i could tell how she has grown but one level is much more than the other now. she has been through so much. and i think she has a place for me inside her mind and she wants me there in that place and it is lower than what i truly am.<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:45:32 PM  heather  carey  it was an attack in ways, a test<br />

<br />
12/07/2008  11:49:43 PM  heather  carey  all i am trying to do is grow up to be a better person for me and my family<br />

12/07/2008  11:50:14 PM  heather  carey  the way she used Gods name made me want to throw up literally<br />

<br />
12/07/2008  11:51:54 PM  heather  carey  dont get me wrong, i care but it is time for me and mine i got to care for me. they dont want me they say things, terrible things about me then they lie when i confront them and i am sick of that<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:52:41 PM  carey  heather  may i ask why you care about them? besides your history with them<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:53:18 PM  heather  carey  they would not care they have not been here. and i said some thing to her about that, i said you do not want to talk to me why are you calling she said yes i did but i was at my mothers and my mother doesnt like people around and this and that blah blah blah but i knew better, i was her friend from the beginning before certain other people came into her life and they told me how mckenzie was going<br />
<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:53:20 PM  carey  heather  what have they done for you? were they there for you in times of need? and were they genuine if they were?<br />

<br />
<br />
12/07/2008  11:54:14 PM  heather  carey  because one place i did not ever take from was lisas because i considered her sacred<br />

<br />
<br />
13/07/2008  12:01:20 AM  carey  heather  This is a good day for you to stay in and rest, dear Leo. Trying to make sense of things today may only leave you frustrated and upset. This is not a day to try to find analytical reasoning in regards to the way things are done. This is a day to see the big picture and to feel more than think. Strong forces are urging you to see the other side of the picture so that you can create a better sense o<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
11/09/2008  12:57:56 AM  heather  carey  i am not trying to be rude. pretend we are talking through one of those radios. the radio has a lot of static and it is hard for me to communicate to you what i need you to hear.<br />

<br />
<br />
11/09/2008  1:01:55 AM  carey  heather  i am alive and i do have emotions and a mind. from what i see, this is the only way to fight back: to kill myself with bullshit. i dont like doing the things i have been doing but i have taken a new stance on certain things. i believe that confrontations are the fastest way to avoid things. avoiding them will only postpone the inevidible.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/09/2008  1:03:48 AM  carey  heather  i want my kids happy. i want you happy. but i cant do a dammed thing about that if i aint happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/09/2008  1:04:25 AM  heather  carey  u need to decide what makes u happy, becuz u wasn't happy today pretending either.<br />

11/09/2008  1:06:50 AM  heather  carey  Political interference in federal government science is weakening our nation's ability to respond to the complex challenges we face. Because policy makers depend on impartial research to make informed decisions, we are mobilizing scientists and citizens alike to push for reforms that will enable our leaders to fully protect our health, safety, and environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
11/09/2008  1:09:02 AM  carey  heather  first we need to get drug free, next we need to work on you staying home more. 3rd, we need to get you to realize that you can tell me you need a break. you need to realize i know when you need a break. you need to know all you have to do is say, &quot;dad, i need a break. im going for a ride. ill be home at xxhours.&quot; you dont even have to ask me. there doesent have to be lies. i hate having to lie jus<br />

<br />
<br />
11/09/2008  1:13:34 AM  carey  heather  noone knows how bad it hurts me to push my kids away. and i dont think anyone cares either. i am showing you things and you say i have no idea what i am doing, but god is behind me. i do what i do to prove what i must. if i cannot prove it, i have failed my one task god has appointed me with.<br />

consists of three tests: strength, flexibility and endurance.\n\n\nan athlete is given the tests.\n\n\nthen the results are calculated and the athlete is given his power per pound rating.\n\n\nthis will eliminate the need for scouts and will greatly increase the effectiveness of any\n\n\n coach, team, and any sport in general.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n Lessons:\n\n\nwhen a person can do something better than you, aknowledge that fact, then emulate them.\n\n\n continue to emulate them until you understand why they do what they do.\n\n\nonce you understand, you can elevate your own abilities beyond the average.\n\n\nonce you emulate, try to think of ways to better it, then try it.\n\n\n once you understand this, you will understand that nothing, not even fighting is physical.\n\n\n it is all mental.\n\n\nonce you realize it is all mental, you can elevate your mind, body, and spirit far beyond\n\n\n human levels.\n\n\nyou can understand the entire universe with this method.\n\n\nyou can understand anything using this method.\n\n\nstay true to your morals no matter what.\n\n\nregardless if you have good morals or bad, if you stay true to your beliefs, you will\n\n\nnever feel doubt, and the lord will favor you.\n\n\n empathy is a good emotion because it promotes understanding.\n\n\nunderstanding is the key.\n\n\nonce you understand something, you can see it.\n\n\nwhat you see before you understand is an illusion.\n\n\nwhat you see once you understand is the truth.\n\n\npride should not be confused with ego.\n\n\nego is believing you are better, pride is knowing you are.\n\n\nthe man with wisdom also knows that great pride comes from great humbleness.\n\n\nyou may ask, \"how so?\" you learn nothing without humbling yourself.\n\n\nyou attain pride through this action because you remember what you were taught, you\n\n\nremember learning your lesson well, and you remember wanting to make your teacher proud\n\n\nthat they taught you.\n\n\nonce you perfect the technique you were taught, you are proud, and your teacher is proud.\n\n\nlater in life when someone below your level tries to defy you, you will remember what you\n\n\nwere taught and you will feel compelled to teach the person a lesson you were taught.\n\n\nif they do not listen, then you show them why they should.\n\n\nprove your pride.\n\n\nshow people how it feels to be on the top, and on the bottom.\n\n\nmake sure they understand what they are giving up if they choose not to accept.\n\n\nedwin starr once said, \"war, what is it good for? absolutely nothing.\"\n\n\nthe truth is, when the spirit and the mind goes to war against each other, it is good.\n\n\nthe reason is that it builds character, it ends any conflicts between spirit and mind.\n\n\nyou must ask yourself, \"are we godless beings created by total randomness?\n\n\nor were we created for a divine purpose?\"\n\n\nthe bible says people were created in gods image.\n\n\nwe have all the feelings the world owns. hate, love, rage,compassion.\n\n\nso does god.\n\n\npeople think he is perfect, yet we were made in his image.\n\n\none of peoples favorite phrases are, \"people arent perfect.\"\n\n\nto that i say perfection can be achieved for both humans and our lord.\n\n\nto do things with honor, pride, and dignity are the first steps.\n\n\neven the most wicked of souls are taught this before anything.\n\n\nwhen you die, you have no choice but to be honorable.\n\n\nlaws in the afterlife are bound to your soul and there is no escaping that fact.\n\n\nthat is why spirits attempt to harm alive people, but they cannot.\n\n\nthe wicked cannot defy, and the divine cannot defy.\n\n\nthe reason satan was granted the power to temporarily avoid this is because of an emotion\n\n\n he once had.\n\n\nit was the emotion of imbalance.\n\n\nhe felt things were done wrongly, and god allows this kind of defiance.\n\n\nhe looks at it as a debate.\n\n\nfor if you can defeat the lord, surely you are right.\n\n\nsadly, satan did not fully understand the lord.\n\n\nhe did not heed my advice of emulation.\n\n\nhe did not understand that emulation is the only way to the next level.\n\n\ninstead he tried to force.\n\n\nthe reason he does not understand is that it is not important to him at this time.\n\n\nhe only lives in the present with no care for the future.\n\n\nfor if he did, he would realize that things get old.\n\n\nyou get tired of repetitive things.\n\n\neventually even satan will turn from his ways.\n\n\npeople will always want to try new things once they have made the decision that they are\n\n\n tired of things.\n\n\nthat is why the lord is everyones lord.\n\n\nthat is why the lord is called I am.\n\n\nhe is everything.\n\n\nhe is you, he is me, he is satan, he is the holy priest.\n\n\nhe understands us all.\n\n\nhe chose to give us all seperate names, but together, we are, \"I am.\"\n\n\ndo not let the illusion fog your mind.\n\n\nrebuke temporary happiness.\n\n\nrealize there is something far greater.\n\n\nnow, open your eyes and look at the world with new eyes.\n\n\nones that can see through the fog.\n\n\nones that sees the amazing world that engulfs you.\n\n\nrealize you are a part of it always and one day you will go back to it.\n\n\nunderstand the lord and he will suredly be happy.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n The Tracks\n\n\na wise young man and an ignorant young man walk down the train tracks.\n\n\nto the left of them, beauty.\n\n\nto the right of them, horror.\n\n\nthe ignorant man goes to the left and the wise man yells out, \"never go to the left!\"\n\n\nthe ignorant man says, \"why?\"\n\n\nthe wise man says, \"you will find out.\"\n\n\nthe ignorant man mutters, \"ok.\"\n\n\nhe continues into the happiness.\n\n\nthe wise man keeps walking.\n\n\nafter some time the wise man becomes hungry, so he sits on the tracks and eats.\n\n\nthe ignorant man crawls out of the happiness.\n\n\nhe says, \"happiness has destroyed me.\"\n\n\nthe wise man mumbles with his mouth full,\n\n\n\"so now do you know why i said to never go to the left?\"\n\n\nthe ignorant man says, \"i am not the same, i am wise now as well.\"\n\n\nthen he speaks the words that make the angels themselves cry.\n\n\nhe says, \"i filled myself with bliss.\"\n\n\n\"i had no cares.\"\n\n\n\"i did not care to eat beacuse i did not want.\"\n\n\n\"i did not care to do anything.\"\n\n\n\"i did not care to even beat my heart.\"\n\n\nthen the wise man said to him, \"suredly thats not true, for you would have died.\"\n\n\nthen the ignorant man said, \"the ignorant man did die.\"\n\n\n\"for what you see now is what is left.\"\n\n\nthe wise men stood up and continued to walk down the tracks.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n Tome\n\n\npeople tell me my forefathers left me nothing.\n\n\nthey left me no land, no riches, no glory.\n\n\nthese people do not realize that they are blind.\n\n\nwhat i mean by this is that they cannot see a thing.\n\n\nthey are looking right at me, telling me this, and they do not realize that\n\n\nmy ancestors gave me everything i am.\n\n\nthey gave me my body.\n\n\nthey gave me my mind.\n\n\nthey gave me my soul.\n\n\nto me, they are greater than if you were given the universe itself.\n\n\nto the other, it is less than an acre of land.\n\n\nit is funny to me.\n\n\ni wonder how much they think their mind, body, and soul would cost.\n\n\ni wonder if i could buy them for an acre of land.\n\n\ni wonder if they will ever realize that that acre\n\n\nis only\n\n\na\n\n\ngrain\n\n\nof sand.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n Memory Dump\n\n\nawareness is the key.\n\n\navoid complacency at all cost.\n\n\nwhat killed the cat?\n\n\nstupidity.\n\n\nit was curiosity that made the cat want to look into the hole.\n\n\nit was stupidity that made the cat stick its head into the hole.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n Random Access\n\n\ndreams are a trip.\n\n\nnightmares suck.\n\n\nbut even so, there is alot to be learned from nightmares.\n\n\nmost people dont realize this, but if you see something, you have the ability to emulate it.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n ZEN 0101111\n\n\nnever quit, never give up, defend, dont attack.\n\n\nonly then will you know the truth.\n\n\ngenerosity before greed.\n\n\nonly then will you feel the truth.\n\n\napplication.\n\n\nonly then will you accept the truth.\n\n\nwisdom and understanding are two of the most important \"things\" a person can have.\n\n\nanother is determination.\n\n\nanother is harmony.\n\n\ni will let you decide the rest.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n Circle Of Iron\n\n\ni watched a movie today, it was called circle of iron.\n\n\nthe movie

thats a different story.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n Prologue\n\n\nthe man who deiphered the code looked in the mirror and realized\n\n\nthat he is not the same man he used to be.\n\n\nhe curses the code.\n\n\nhe hates the code.\n\n\nlife was so much easier when bathed in stupidity.\n\n\nhe begs for the blindness again.\n\n\nhe then realizes ____________ .\n\n\nthen he realizes i am is his brother.\n\n\nbaby dont
