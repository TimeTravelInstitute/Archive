<br />
--- Hyperdrive Hyperfast Travel &amp; Warp Drives. --- <br />
<br />
In Star Trek, the USS Enterprise is powered by what is called a <br />
&quot;warp drive&quot; and at the moment only Paramount Pictures know its <br />
secrets. <br />
<br />
But new, highly mathematical research may have brought us one step <br />
closer to being able to explore the Universe in a starship capable of <br />
travelling faster than the speed of light. <br />
<br />
The analysis of the concept of a warp drive by Chris Van Den Broeck <br />
of the Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium means that building a <br />
starship Enterprise is a little closer. <br />
<br />
The fabric of space <br />
<br />
Dr Van Den Broeck was reanalysing ground-breaking calculations made <br />
five years ago by Mexican mathematician Miguel Alcubierre. <br />
<br />
Science fiction becoming science fact? <br />
Alcubierre said that it was possible to imagine how a warp drive <br />
would work by distorting the fabric of space. Starships would ride <br />
along waves in so-called spacetime, like surfers do along waves in <br />
the sea. <br />
<br />
The idea relies on the concept that, to physicists, space is not <br />
empty. Strange as it may seem, space has a shape that can be <br />
distorted by matter. In fact the force of gravity is actually due to <br />
the curvature of space - recognising that was the greatest triumph of <br />
Albert Einstein's career. <br />
<br />
So you could use matter to distort the space around a starship to <br />
create a &quot;ripple&quot; in spacetime. <br />
<br />
The starship would have to be microscopically small on the outside <br />
but large enough on the inside to carry passengers, just like the <br />
Tardis in the British sci-fi series, Dr Who. <br />
<br />
'Warp bubble' <br />
<br />
Miguel Alcubierre came up with the idea of expanding the space behind <br />
a starship and contracting it in front of it. The starship would rest <br />
in a &quot;warp bubble&quot; between the two spacetime distortions. The result <br />
would be a wave in spacetime along which the starship would surf. <br />
<br />
Van Den Broeck: &quot;It's possible in principle&quot; <br />
It was a fantastic idea. There would be no limit to the velocity that <br />
a starship could attain. It could travel faster than the speed of <br />
light because the starship would, strictly speaking, be stationary in <br />
the space of its warp bubble. <br />
<br />
Also, the starship and its crew would be weightless and would <br />
therefore not be crushed by the enormous G-forces of acceleration and <br />
deceleration. <br />
<br />
What's more, the passage of time inside the warp bubble would be the <br />
same as that outside it. The crew would not suffer from <br />
Einstein's &quot;time dilation&quot; effect where time passes at different <br />
rates for people travelling at different speeds. <br />
<br />
The time dilation effect means that anyone travelling to the stars at <br />
speeds approaching that of light would experience a journey of a few <br />
years. But when they came back to Earth they would find that <br />
thousands of years had passed and all their friends were long dead. <br />
<br />
Massive energies <br />
<br />
Alcubierre's idea was a good one, but his work seemed to suggest that <br />
building a warp bubble would be impossible in practice. More energy <br />
than the entire universe could supply would be needed to create the <br />
spacetime distortions. <br />
<br />
However, Dr Van Den Broeck's analysis suggests a far lower amount of <br />
energy is required, reduced by a factor of one followed by 62 zeros. <br />
<br />
This is not to say that it is time to go out and start building a <br />
warp drive. As Dr Van Den Broeck says in his forthcoming paper in <br />
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology: &quot;This does not mean that <br />
the proposal is realistic.&quot; <br />
<br />
Building a warp drive is currently far beyond our technological <br />
abilities and there are severe theoretical arguments that say it may <br />
never be possible. <br />
<br />
But it just might be. Dr Van Den Broeck concludes his analysis by <br />
saying, &quot;The first warp drive is still a long way off but maybe it <br />
has now become slightly less improbable.&quot; <br />

<br />
The Warp Drive: Hyper-Fast Travel Within General Relativity <br />
<br />
Miguel Alcubierre <br />
Class. Quantum Grav. 11 (1994), L73-L77. <br />
<br />
Abstract: <br />
It is shown how, within the framework of general relativity and <br />
without the introduction of wormholes, it is <br />
possible to modify a spacetime in a way that allows a spaceship to <br />
travel with an arbitrarily large speed. By a <br />
purely local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an <br />
opposite contraction in front of it, motion faster than the speed of <br />
light as seen by observers outside the disturbed region is possible. <br />
The resulting distortion is reminiscent of the ``warp drive'' of <br />
science fiction. However, just as it happens with wormholes, exotic <br />
matter will be needed in order to generate a distortion of spacetime <br />
like the one discussed here. <br />
<br />
We see then that, just as it happens with wormholes, one needs exotic <br />
matter to travel faster than the speed of light. However, even if one <br />
believes that exotic matter is forbidden classically, it is well <br />
known that quantum field theory permits the existence of regions with <br />
negative energy densities in some special circumstances (as, for <br />
example, in the Casimir effect~\cite{DeWitt}). The need of exotic <br />
matter therefore doesn't necessarily eliminate the possibility of <br />
using a spacetime distortion like the one described above for hyper- <br />
fast interstellar travel. As a final comment, I will just mention the <br />
fact that even though the spacetime described by the metric~(\ref <br />
{final_metric}) is globally hyperbolic, and hence contains no closed <br />
causal curves, it is probably not very difficult to construct a <br />
spacetime that does contain such curves using a similar idea to the <br />
one presented here. \vspace{10mm} <br />
<br />
The author wishes to thank Bernard F. Schutz and Gareth S. Jones for <br />
many useful comments. <br />

--- Research on Electromotive Force, the CIA and T.T. Brown. --- <br />
<br />
In UFO drive systems the field effect can be manipulated by the craft <br />
so as to effect electrical system not directly connected to the <br />
vehicle, causing these systems to fail. <br />
<br />
The effect is described by the dictionary description of <br />
electromotive force as: A field which can energize external <br />
circuits.&quot; Much like the way Active Radar defeating systems opperate <br />
by matching the radar energy and canceling it out, an electromotive <br />
system can match the frequency of external circuits and cancel out <br />
there operation or energize them to a blow out level. UFO's have long <br />
establishe this ability and demonstrated this effect. So it serves <br />
that they operate on an electromotive force, at least in part. <br />
<br />
The Early work of Tomas Townsend Brown was classified by the <br />
Government. He demonstrated that His Electrokinetic Transducers <br />
operated of a principle that was up until that time unknown. By <br />
placing his Transducers in a vacuum. <br />
<br />
He proved that it was not operating on electrostatic wind but was an <br />
entirely different and more powerful force. <br />
<br />
All of the Patents awarded to T.T. Brown were assigned (sold to) The <br />
Whitehall Rand Corp. now defunked, it served as a CIA cover company <br />
to obtain this technology and use it for clandestine vehicles. Which <br />
just happened to be around the early 1950's. A time well known in <br />
history as one of the most significant flap periods in our history. <br />
The coincidence of timing is astounding. While this is by no means <br />
the answer to all of the UFO's spotted in our skies. It is probably <br />
the reason for a lot of them. Our Government is now coming clean in a <br />
round about way, but they still spend Billions of our tax dollars on <br />
technology they know good and well will never get us very far in the <br />
universe. At the same time they spend more money on a dual and secret <br />
space program. This is under the Guise of National Security. The <br />
truth is they are protecting their exclusive use of this technology <br />
until they can get far enough ahead of the rest of us so they can <br />
maintain control over us and our resources. They have effectively <br />
stopped any private attempts to duplicate there efforts in the <br />
private sector. Starting many years ago. <br />
<br />
In this area of effect I am reminded of the Colorado Springs Project <br />
done by Tesla. In this experiment Tesla pumped power into the Earth <br />
at the Earth's resonance frequency, then he received a return stroke. <br />
<br />
He then amplified the return stroke and returned in to the Earth, he <br />
then received another more exponentially powerful return stroke. This <br />
operation kept going until he had such electrical pressure built up <br />
that he could not contain the energy. He then released the energy <br />
blowing out conventional power systems for a 100 mile radius. <br />
<br />
This left the whole area without power for some time, demonstrating <br />
clearly that the two systems could not be operated at the same time. <br />
<br />
In Jacques Vallee's book &quot;Passport to Magonia&quot; actor Stuart Whitman <br />
was reported to state that he witnessed 2 UFO craft during the great <br />
blackout of Nov. 8th 1965 and further stated that he heard them <br />
exclaim in english that the blackout was a demonstration. <br />
<br />
That started me thinking about my physics training. Electromotive <br />
Force is described as that field which can drive current into <br />
external circuits. So if the UFO's Drive system is electromotive, it <br />
follows that the theory of electrohydrodynamic field effect is a <br />
correct model. <br />
<br />
So what we are seeing is not as advanced as some science fiction <br />
writers, and UFO true believers would have us believe. It is known in <br />
electrohydrodynamic drive theory that an electostatic charge can push <br />
away the air in front of the ship,creating a relative vacuum for the <br />
ship to fall into, since the air pressure behind the ship is greater <br />
than pressure in front of the ship, the craft moves into the area of <br />
vacuum because it is the path of least resistance.So the engines need <br />
not be all that powerful, as they would have to be to propel the ship <br />
against solid atmosphere. They only have to be strong enough to <br />
propel it into this area of relative vacuum. <br />
<br />
This would only require magnetic field levels which can easily be <br />
archived by modern methods as I have show in my book. By matching the <br />
Earth's magnetic field then pumping it at it's resonance frequency, <br />
the ship will receive a return stroke from the Earthwhich is strong <br />
enough to propel it into the relative vacuum created by the <br />
electromotive force created by the electrostatic charge on the <br />
surface of the ship. The two fields when crossed at 90% creates a <br />
Lorenz force pushing the ship away from the greater force excerpting <br />
body &quot;the Earth's field&quot; <br />
<br />
So with easily achievable power levels and easily archived Super <br />
conductive magnetic field levels we can expect craft which can <br />
archive escape velocity from the gravity well of our planet. They <br />
should be able to carry a good sized payload into space as well.With <br />
the Taylor engine for example, when combined with the <br />
electrohydrodynamic model should be able to carry a payload of 50 <br />
tons into space. <br />
<br />
That is all for now, more to come in my next article. <br />

*World Space Drives <br />
Space Drives (i.e. non-rocket type aerospace propulsion engines) is a <br />
descriptive term, invented by Arthur C. Clarke, to denote a wished- <br />
for rocket propulsion system replacement. Space Drive Fiction became <br />
commonplace as SF-writers embraced this non-rocket space drive <br />
concept, and have been using them for years in their stories (i.e. <br />
jetless drives, gravitic drives, inertial drives, warp drives, etc). <br />
Consider the CITIES IN FLIGHT series by James Blish, or the Lee <br />
Correy novel STAR DRIVER, etc. Experimenters/inventors/theorists, and <br />
even some scientists, have been trying to develop the non-rocket <br />
space drive concept to real hardware, as far back as the 193O's. In <br />
the 196O's John W. Campbell, editor of Analog Sci-Fi magazine, <br />
championed the Dean Space Drive and then Davis Mechanics. In later <br />
years an Analog Editoral introduced Prof. Eric R. Laithwaite and his <br />
Gyro-Thrust device. <br />

*AntiGravity Article From: &quot;Scientific American&quot; <br />
(By: Mark Connolly) I have recently heard reports of a researcher <br />
claiming to have produced anti-gravity effects using a spinning, <br />
superconducting disk. Is there any theoretical basis to support the <br />
existence of anti-gravity or of some method of shielding out gravity? <br />

*BAe's anti-gravity research, By: James Meek, science correspondent <br />
BAe's anti-gravity research braves X-Files ridicule, Serious Progress <br />
Hinted In Secret Anti-Gravity Projects . The military wing of the hi- <br />
tech conglomerate BAe Systems took the Podkletnov experiment so <br />
seriously that it has launched an anti-gravity research programme, <br />
Project Greenglow. If the technology could be made to work it would <br />
make existing forms of transport obsolete. <br />

*Robert Cook's Inertial Propulsion <br />
[US Patent #4238968]- Robert Cook Makes new Breakthrough! After <br />
conducting several months of experiments on a new clean energy <br />
source, Robert Cook has solved the last problem that was preventing <br />
the new system¡¯s success. Sometime before the end of 2004 this new <br />
system will be presented to the world. It will be a revolutionary <br />
invention. The CIP engine has also been successfully tested on a <br />
Cavendish Torsion Pendulum. Several months of testing on the pendulum <br />
proves that the engine is producing a unidirectional, internal, <br />
reactionless force. The scientific community wanted the system tested <br />
on a regular swinging pendulum, but this could not be done because <br />
the system as constructed only produces an impulse and not a constant <br />
force. The torsion pendulum proves the same thing that a test on a <br />
swing pendulum does. This system will eventually produce a constant <br />
force and will be able to levitate but this will require a 12 to 16 <br />
rotor unit. The test model only has 2 rotors, that is why it can only <br />
produce an impulse and not a constant force. Many scientists and <br />
engineers that have seen the pendulum tests have declared it a big <br />
success. Many have admitted they would not have believed it if they <br />
hadn¡¯t seen for themselves what the unit can do. <br />

*The Thomas Townsend Brown Early Warped Ideas <br />
Early Warped Ideas By Dan McCosh (04,2001)...The man who would later <br />
invent the flying saucer was a student at Caltech in 1923, when he <br />
first began espousing his theory of gravitation. But the world of <br />
conventional physics wasn't quite ready for the ideas of Thomas <br />
Townsend Brown, who told his classmates that gravity was a positive <br />
force that permeates space, a force that could be directed by high- <br />
voltage electricity. At a time when rocket science itself was in its <br />
infancy, he speculated that this could be the basis of an <br />
interstellar space drive free of the limitations of conventional <br />
rockets. It didn't help when the popular press of the day quickly <br />
embraced his ideas, while the establishment at Caltech ridiculed <br />
them. <br />

Thomas Townsend Brown, an American physicist, was a leader in <br />
developing theories concerning the link between electromagnetic and <br />
gravitational fields theorized by Dr. Albert Einstein. He advanced <br />
from theory to application with the development of solid and disc- <br />
shaped apparatuses which are believed to have created and utilized <br />
temporary, localized gravitational fields. <br />

*GCT - &quot;The Future Of Flight&quot; <br />
Victor Rozsnyay - (Founder and CEO) Gravity Control Technologies was <br />
founded by 3 Hungarian individuals with financing provided by Joe <br />
Firmage. Over the course of the last 3 years, since GCT was <br />
established, many people have worked for the project. Gravity Control <br />
Technologies is an evolutionary research and experimental body <br />
devoted to achieving 100% propellantless propulsion technology for <br />
flight. We work on 6 different research fields which have the <br />
potential of providing a number of different technological <br />
breakthroughs...nuclear physics, quantum physics, plasma physics, <br />
temperature independent superconductivity, Zero Point Fields physics <br />
and information physics. Over the course of the last 15 years we have <br />
established a comprehensive theoretical framework with makes all of <br />
these technological innovations possible. - We are now seeking <br />
financing to build technology demonstrator equipment for each of <br />
these fields as part of our Phase I Unmanned Prototype development <br />
effort. Note: Interested parties should contact us through email at <br />
<br />
<br />
Gravity Control Technologies is a privately held aerospace research <br />
firm developing technological breakthroughs based on Zero Point <br />
Energy Field physics, specially manufactured BEC superconductors and <br />
Information Physics. Our company was founded in 1999 by three <br />
Hungarian natives, with funding provided by Joe Firmage, former CEO <br />
of USWeb, Intend Change and the International Space Sciences <br />
Organization. Initial exploratory work on technological feasibility <br />
was conducted in the United States in 1998. When promising results <br />
were achieved we relocated to Hungary where available funding could <br />
be spent more efficiently. Laboratory facilities were rented and set <br />
up at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences owned Central Research <br />
Institute for Physics and scientists recruited to help implement our <br />
research program. In addition to the chemistry research meant to <br />
synthesize the special superconductors, a plasma physics research <br />
group was also established to pursue an alternative method aimed at <br />
producing weight reduction, and to demonstrate initial gravity <br />
control properties. Both groups have been able to demonstrate what we <br />
believe are significant milestones towards the success of GCT <br />
initiatives. To date over USD 1,200,000 has been invested in the <br />
development effort. We have been able to establish a comprehensive <br />
theoretical framework to illustrate how and why the control of <br />
gravity for flight can be accomplished. Some experimental results <br />
have also been achieved. Based on this work GCT is in the process of <br />
seeking additional funding to build demonstration units of all the <br />
technologies we believe are possible based on the understanding of <br />
Zero Point Field physics. This web site was built to introduce our <br />
work to as wide an audience as possible in hope of finding a financier <br />
(s) who can help us reach the next step in our development program. <br />

		"articleBody": "\\\"Breaking Out From The Gravity Well\\\"...\n\n--- Hyperdrive Hyperfast Travel & Warp Drives. --- \n\nIn Star Trek, the USS Enterprise is powered by what is called a \n\"warp drive\" and at the moment only Paramount Pictures know its \nsecrets. \n\nBut new, highly mathematical research may have brought us one step \ncloser to being able to explore the Universe in a starship capable of \ntravelling faster than the speed of light. \n\nThe analysis of the concept of a warp drive by Chris Van Den Broeck \nof the Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium means that building a \nstarship Enterprise is a little closer. \n\nThe fabric of space \n\nDr Van Den Broeck was reanalysing ground-breaking calculations made \nfive years ago by Mexican mathematician Miguel Alcubierre. \n\nScience fiction becoming science fact? \nAlcubierre said that it was possible to imagine how a warp drive \nwould work by distorting the fabric of space. Starships would ride \nalong waves in so-called spacetime, like surfers do along waves in \nthe sea. \n\nThe idea relies on the concept that, to physicists, space is not \nempty. Strange as it may seem, space has a shape that can be \ndistorted by matter. In fact the force of gravity is actually due to \nthe curvature of space - recognising that was the greatest triumph of \nAlbert Einstein's career. \n\nSo you could use matter to distort the space around a starship to \ncreate a \"ripple\" in spacetime. \n\nThe starship would have to be microscopically small on the outside \nbut large enough on the inside to carry passengers, just like the \nTardis in the British sci-fi series, Dr Who. \n\n'Warp bubble' \n\nMiguel Alcubierre came up with the idea of expanding the space behind \na starship and contracting it in front of it. The starship would rest \nin a \"warp bubble\" between the two spacetime distortions. The result \nwould be a wave in spacetime along which the starship would surf. \n\nVan Den Broeck: \"It's possible in principle\" \nIt was a fantastic idea. There would be no limit to the velocity that \na starship could attain. It could travel faster than the speed of \nlight because the starship would, strictly speaking, be stationary in \nthe space of its warp bubble. \n\nAlso, the starship and its crew would be weightless and would \ntherefore not be crushed by the enormous G-forces of acceleration and \ndeceleration. \n\nWhat's more, the passage of time inside the warp bubble would be the \nsame as that outside it. The crew would not suffer from \nEinstein's \"time dilation\" effect where time passes at different \nrates for people travelling at different speeds. \n\nThe time dilation effect means that anyone travelling to the stars at \nspeeds approaching that of light would experience a journey of a few \nyears. But when they came back to Earth they would find that \nthousands of years had passed and all their friends were long dead. \n\nMassive energies \n\nAlcubierre's idea was a good one, but his work seemed to suggest that \nbuilding a warp bubble would be impossible in practice. More energy \nthan the entire universe could supply would be needed to create the \nspacetime distortions. \n\nHowever, Dr Van Den Broeck's analysis suggests a far lower amount of \nenergy is required, reduced by a factor of one followed by 62 zeros. \n\nThis is not to say that it is time to go out and start building a \nwarp drive. As Dr Van Den Broeck says in his forthcoming paper in \nGeneral Relativity and Quantum Cosmology: \"This does not mean that \nthe proposal is realistic.\" \n\nBuilding a warp drive is currently far beyond our technological \nabilities and there are severe theoretical arguments that say it may \nnever be possible. \n\nBut it just might be. Dr Van Den Broeck concludes his analysis by \nsaying, \"The first warp drive is still a long way off but maybe it \nhas now become slightly less improbable.\" \n\n[Courtesy of BBC News Online - \nArticle Posted by Science Editor Dr David Whitehouse] \nhttp:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/sci\/tech\/364496.stm \n\nBelow is the original text of the article written in 1994. This will \nbecome an important historical document, IMHO. (Note that the \nillegible symbols in the text are remnants from the source (a LaTeX \ndocument) and relate primarily to formatting and equation codes. They \nwill be eliminated and replaced with the appropriate values in the \nnear future. The author has been contacted for a copy of the original \ndocument. Stay tuned.) \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n\"Class Quant Grav 11 (1994) 73-77 ISSN 0264-9381\" \n\nThe Warp Drive: Hyper-Fast Travel Within General Relativity \n\nMiguel Alcubierre \nClass. Quantum Grav. 11 (1994), L73-L77. \n\nAbstract: \nIt is shown how, within the framework of general relativity and \nwithout the introduction of wormholes, it is \npossible to modify a spacetime in a way that allows a spaceship to \ntravel with an arbitrarily large speed. By a \npurely local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an \nopposite contraction in front of it, motion faster than the speed of \nlight as seen by observers outside the disturbed region is possible. \nThe resulting distortion is reminiscent of the ``warp drive'' of \nscience fiction. However, just as it happens with wormholes, exotic \nmatter will be needed in order to generate a distortion of spacetime \nlike the one discussed here. \n\nWe see then that, just as it happens with wormholes, one needs exotic \nmatter to travel faster than the speed of light. However, even if one \nbelieves that exotic matter is forbidden classically, it is well \nknown that quantum field theory permits the existence of regions with \nnegative energy densities in some special circumstances (as, for \nexample, in the Casimir effect~\\cite{DeWitt}). The need of exotic \nmatter therefore doesn't necessarily eliminate the possibility of \nusing a spacetime distortion like the one described above for hyper- \nfast interstellar travel. As a final comment, I will just mention the \nfact that even though the spacetime described by the metric~(\\ref \n{final_metric}) is globally hyperbolic, and hence contains no closed \ncausal curves, it is probably not very difficult to construct a \nspacetime that does contain such curves using a similar idea to the \none presented here. \\vspace{10mm} \n\nThe author wishes to thank Bernard F. Schutz and Gareth S. Jones for \nmany useful comments. \n\n(More available) \nhttp:\/\/www.yellowknife.com\/warp \n\n--- Research on Electromotive Force, the CIA and T.T. Brown. --- \n\nIn UFO drive systems the field effect can be manipulated by the craft \nso as to effect electrical system not directly connected to the \nvehicle, causing these systems to fail. \n\nThe effect is described by the dictionary description of \nelectromotive force as: A field which can energize external \ncircuits.\" Much like the way Active Radar defeating systems opperate \nby matching the radar energy and canceling it out, an electromotive \nsystem can match the frequency of external circuits and cancel out \nthere operation or energize them to a blow out level. UFO's have long \nestablishe this ability and demonstrated this effect. So it serves \nthat they operate on an electromotive force, at least in part. \n\nThe Early work of Tomas Townsend Brown was classified by the \nGovernment. He demonstrated that His Electrokinetic Transducers \noperated of a principle that was up until that time unknown. By \nplacing his Transducers in a vacuum. \n\nHe proved that it was not operating on electrostatic wind but was an \nentirely different and more powerful force. \n\nAll of the Patents awarded to T.T. Brown were assigned (sold to) The \nWhitehall Rand Corp. now defunked, it served as a CIA cover company \nto obtain this technology and use it for clandestine vehicles. Which \njust happened to be around the early 1950's. A time well known in \nhistory as one of the most significant flap periods in our history. \nThe coincidence of timing is astounding. While this is by no means \nthe answer to all of the UFO's spotted in our skies. It is probably \nthe reason for a lot of them. Our Government is now coming clean in a \nround about way, but they still spend Billions of our tax dollars on \ntechnology they know good and well will never get us very far in the \nuniverse. At the same time they spend more money on a dual and secret \nspace program. This is under the Guise of National Security. The \ntruth is they are protecting their exclusive use of this technology \nuntil they can get far enough ahead of the rest of us so they can \nmaintain control over us and our resources. They have effectively \nstopped any private attempts to duplicate there efforts in the \nprivate sector. Starting many years ago. \n\nIn this area of effect I am reminded of the Colorado Springs Project \ndone by Tesla. In this experiment Tesla pumped power into the Earth \nat the Earth's resonance frequency, then he received a return stroke. \n\nHe then amplified the return stroke and returned in to the Earth, he \nthen received another more exponentially powerful return stroke. This \noperation kept going until he had such electrical pressure built up \nthat he could not contain the energy. He then released the energy \nblowing out conventional power systems for a 100 mile radius. \n\nThis left the whole area without power for some time, demonstrating \nclearly that the two systems could not be operated at the same time. \n\nIn Jacques Vallee's book \"Passport to Magonia\" actor Stuart Whitman \nwas reported to state that he witnessed 2 UFO craft during the great \nblackout of Nov. 8th 1965 and further stated that he heard them \nexclaim in english that the blackout was a demonstration. \n\nThat started me thinking about my physics training. Electromotive \nForce is described as that field which can drive current into \nexternal circuits. So if the UFO's Drive system is electromotive, it \nfollows that the theory of electrohydrodynamic field effect is a \ncorrect model. \n\nSo what we are seeing is not as advanced as some science fiction \nwriters, and UFO true believers would have us believe. It is known in \nelectrohydrodynamic drive theory that an electostatic charge can push \naway the air in front of the ship,creating a relative vacuum for the \nship to fall into, since the air pressure behind the ship is greater \nthan pressure in front of the ship, the craft moves into the area of \nvacuum because it is the path of least resistance.So the engines need \nnot be all that powerful, as they would have to be to propel the ship \nagainst solid atmosphere. They only have to be strong enough to \npropel it into this area of relative vacuum. \n\nThis would only require magnetic field levels which can easily be \narchived by modern methods as I have show in my book. By matching the \nEarth's magnetic field then pumping it at it's resonance frequency, \nthe ship will receive a return stroke from the Earthwhich is strong \nenough to propel it into the relative vacuum created by the \nelectromotive force created by the electrostatic charge on the \nsurface of the ship. The two fields when crossed at 90% creates a \nLorenz force pushing the ship away from the greater force excerpting \nbody \"the Earth's field\" \n\nSo with easily achievable power levels and easily archived Super \nconductive magnetic field levels we can expect craft which can \narchive escape velocity from the gravity well of our planet. They \nshould be able to carry a good sized payload into space as well.With \nthe Taylor engine for example, when combined with the \nelectrohydrodynamic model should be able to carry a payload of 50 \ntons into space. \n\nThat is all for now, more to come in my next article. \n\n---Michael Unum \nAdvanced Research Projects \n\n\n* Additional References: \n\nC.W.

Sometime before the end of 2004 this new \nsystem will be presented to the world. It will be a revolutionary \ninvention. The CIP engine has also been successfully tested on a \nCavendish Torsion Pendulum. Several months of testing on the pendulum \nproves that the engine is producing a unidirectional, internal, \nreactionless force. The scientific community wanted the system tested \non a regular swinging pendulum, but this could not be done because \nthe system as constructed only produces an impulse and not a constant \nforce. The torsion pendulum proves the same thing that a test on a \nswing pendulum does. This system will eventually produce a constant \nforce and will be able to levitate but this will require a 12 to 16 \nrotor unit. The test model only has 2 rotors, that is why it can only \nproduce an impulse and not a constant force. Many scientists and \nengineers that have seen the pendulum tests have declared it a big \nsuccess.

At a time when rocket science itself was in its \ninfancy, he speculated that this could be the basis of an \ninterstellar space drive free of the limitations of conventional \nrockets. It didn't help when the popular press of the day quickly \nembraced his ideas, while the establishment at Caltech ridiculed \nthem. \nhttp:\/\/www.popsci.com\/exclusive\/may2001\/warped.html \n\n*The Thomas Townsend Brown Website \nThomas Townsend Brown, an American physicist, was a leader in \ndeveloping theories concerning the link between electromagnetic and \ngravitational fields theorized by Dr. Albert Einstein.

Over the course of the last 3 years, since GCT was \nestablished, many people have worked for the project. Gravity Control \nTechnologies is an evolutionary research and experimental body \ndevoted to achieving 100% propellantless propulsion technology for \nflight. We work on 6 different research fields which have the \npotential of providing a number of different technological \nbreakthroughs...nuclear physics, quantum physics, plasma physics, \ntemperature independent superconductivity, Zero Point Fields physics \nand information physics. Over the course of the last 15 years we have \nestablished a comprehensive theoretical framework with makes all of \nthese technological innovations possible. - We are now seeking \nfinancing to build technology demonstrator equipment for each of \nthese fields as part of our Phase I Unmanned Prototype development \neffort. Note: Interested parties should contact us through email at \n\n\nGravity Control Technologies is a privately held aerospace research \nfirm developing technological breakthroughs based on Zero Point \nEnergy Field physics, specially manufactured BEC superconductors and \nInformation Physics. Our company was founded in 1999 by three \nHungarian natives, with funding provided by Joe Firmage, former CEO \nof USWeb, Intend Change and the International Space Sciences \nOrganization. Initial exploratory work on technological feasibility \nwas conducted in the United States in 1998. When promising results \nwere achieved we relocated to Hungary where available funding could \nbe spent more efficiently. Laboratory facilities were rented and set \nup at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences owned Central Research \nInstitute for Physics and scientists recruited to help implement our \nresearch program. In addition to the chemistry research meant to \nsynthesize the special superconductors, a plasma physics research \ngroup was also established to pursue an alternative method aimed at \nproducing weight reduction, and to demonstrate initial gravity \ncontrol properties. Both groups have been able to demonstrate what we \nbelieve are significant milestones towards the success of GCT \ninitiatives. To date over USD 1,200,000 has been invested in the \ndevelopment effort. We have been able to establish a comprehensive \ntheoretical framework to illustrate how and why the control of \ngravity for flight can be accomplished. Some experimental results \nhave also been achieved. Based on this work GCT is in the process of \nseeking additional funding to build demonstration units of all the \ntechnologies we believe are possible based on the understanding of \nZero Point Field physics. This web site was built to introduce our \nwork to as wide an audience as possible in hope of finding a financier \n(s) who can help us reach the next step in our development program. \n[On June 6th we applied to become an X-PRIZE team.] \nhttp:\/\/www.gctspace.com\/main.html \nhttp:\/\/members.nbci.com\/ctglabs",
