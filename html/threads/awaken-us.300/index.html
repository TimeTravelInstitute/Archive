Grimoirium Satanas<br />
Prologue<br />
Satanism is a religion based upon the earthly needs of the individual. It realizes mans need to express himself in the form of religion. It therefore makes existence itself that very religion. The practitioner of Satanick Magick understands that without earthly power he is at a serious disadvantage. It is the here and now that concerns him. He is upon this earth ,and upon this earth ,he must live.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very few scholars will argue that Satan is the 'Lord of the earth'. It is he that holds material wealth in his hands. The Christian is swayed from material and earthly goods by their God for this very reason. For, a taste of success would deter them from the bond of slavery that is characteristic of the Christian Gnosis. <br />
<br />
<br />
Satanism doesn't necessarily view Satan in the same way as modern Christian teachings portray Him. The Satanick magician's thought pattern is based upon scientific data. He views biblical myth as a picturesque teaching system and not as concrete history. For him Satan is Lucifer or Lux-ifer. His name means Light Bearer or Bringer of Light. This taken in context with the idea of Satan as the Lord of the Earth, we then see him as a magickal archetype of the Sun. The Sun is our light bearer and bringer of light. It is the engine of our very existence. Every life form on the earth requires the Sun as its main source of life. Therefore as upon the earth ,we deify the Sun as Satan ,the Bright Spiritual Sun. It must be said that this is not entirely in agreement with the system of Satanism that has been dispensed by Dr Anton Szandor LaVey. It is the result when LaVeyan Magic is integrated with the doctrines and teachings of another pioneer occultist, Aleister Crowley. As this book will deal primarily with practical Satanick Magick, the influence of Dr LaVey will play the prominent part. The works of Mr. Crowley are highly recommended reading for anyone who is serious about occult study. Many Satanists will disagree with this however, the authors firmly believe in the validity of the Aeon of Horus and the New dispensation administered by the Book of the Law. We are not LaVeyites, nor Crowleyites. Nor are we orthodox Satanists but Thelemites who have found great value in the practical system of magic set forth by Dr LaVey. A deeper study of the teachings of Aleister Crowley will be undertaken in the forthcoming volume Sextanik Magick: The Magickal Works of the Beast.<br />
<br />
<br />
The creative platform upon which this system of magick is based lies in that we have taken a force that is harmonious with the intention of earthly magic and applied it in a manner in which it becomes a powerful symbol of the true God of Man, The Great Central Sun.<br />
<br />
<br />
When performing satanick magick you are establishing your own godhead by the identity of yourself with the central source of power. You invoke the energy that we call Lord of the Earth, therefore becoming that energy and in the name of that force manifesting the will from the elemental powers that you have raised. <br />
<br />
<br />
In this book we will be examining the magical system of modern day Satanism of Dr LaVey in the light of the New Aeon Gnosis. It is a complete system of magic based upon personal experience and work of a legitimate Black Magickal Order. (G.O.T.O.S.) It is hoped that the reader will explore this system with an open mind. This is especially so if he happen to be an orthodox LaVeyan Satanist. It is firmly believed that by the integration of traditional magickal techniques and modern satanic thought, a very powerful system of infernal magick is created. With this in mind the student should find no difficulty in building a powerful and successful system for himself. The choice is yours and the door has now been opened wider than ever. This book will allow you entrance into that door to power. <br />
<br />
<br />
It must be said however that even though this magical system has been well researched and a great deal of practical experience has been invested in its composition, there still lies certain dangers. Not those that one would naturally expect but dangers of the mind and more, the ego. Remember the law of the Satanist, 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you'. Power is no excuse for ignorance. And above all remember that the formula is love under will.<br />
<br />
<br />
One common question that is asked is 'why not use the powerful names of God to control and compell the demonic forces'? The answer to this question is quite simple and best expressed by analogy. If you had the desire to make an employee of any given company perform some task, would you go to the supervisor of that companys competitor? No you would not. You would go to the employees boss. So when commanding the infernal forces, why would you use the name of the competitor? Would it not be easier to go straight to their boss? And who is that boss? Satan, not Jehovah.<br />
The Temple should ideally be a rectangular room with as little<br />
windows and natural lighting as possible. The walls should be<br />
uniform in color. Upon each of these walls, in the elemental<br />
directions, should hang the Baphometic Seal of each of the<br />
Infernal Elemental Kings. This Seal is the sigil of Baphomet as<br />
used by the Church of Satan . You will need three seals of the<br />
same size and one that is larger than the three. They are<br />
constructed as such:<br />
<br />
<br />
In the south the seal of Baphomet with the name Shaitan in Hebrew<br />
<br />
In the east the same with Lucifer<br />
<br />
In the north the same with Belial<br />
<br />
And in the west the large one with the customary Leviathan. Upon<br />
this Baphomet Seal, include a third eye. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Above this is the Stele of Revealing. This is the Supreme<br />
Magickal Talisman of the New Aeon. It is the Egregore manifest in<br />
the sphere of Malkuth. Nothing whatsoever is to be placed above<br />
the Stele.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the South, East and North, to be placed upon erect square<br />
pillars, is a single black candle. Also the candle color could<br />
match the element however, black is recommended.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;<i>The Altar</i>&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
Against the west wall is the main altar. It should be about four<br />
feet in length and two feet in width. It stands about five feet<br />
from the ground and is covered with a black drape that hangs to<br />
the floor. On each side of the altar stands a pillar. They are<br />
three and one half feet tall , sides square and flat on top. They<br />
are colored black. Upon each is a large candle. The candle on the<br />
left is black and the one on the right is white..Upon the main<br />
altar lie the censer on the left and the bell on the right. In<br />
the center is another large candle, its color chosen by the rite<br />
itself. In front of this is another altar against the main altar.<br />
Its height should be that of the magicians waist. It is six feet<br />
in length and three in width. It is upon this altar that the<br />
priestess lies. During rites that require no priestess, this<br />
altar may serve as the altar of implements or ideally it should<br />
be removed. It should be remembered that even if no living altar<br />
is used it still is representative of the Mother. She is a form<br />
of Babalon as Satan is associated with The Beast.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;<i>The Altar of Implements</i>&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
In the center of the temple should stand a doudle cubical altar<br />
of black arranged so that when one stands at it you are facing<br />
the Main Altar in the west. Upon this altar is to be placed the<br />
sword, Chalice, Book , etc... <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;<i>The Bell</i>&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
Any convenient bell may be used in Satanick Magick. It is<br />
suggested that it have a deep rich tone and not a sharp “ping”.<br />
The chalice should be a large stemmed goblet. Chose one that best<br />
expresses the greatness of the receptive vessel that it<br />
represents. A deco glass goblet is perfect. Silver may also be<br />
used. LaVey suggests that the practitioner not use gold and in<br />
this we disagree. Gold is the necter of the Sun. It represents<br />
the Will and signifies the “Kingly Man”.<br />
The sword should have a sharp double sided blade that is straight<br />
and bright. The guard, hilt and pommel should be red guilt with<br />
copper wire. Of course, any sword that expresses the dark<br />
infernal power may be used<br />
* The student should study the Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey<br />
should he wish to explore the implements from a strictly satanic<br />
viewpoint<br />
The temple is set up as described in part one. Upon the main<br />
altar are the three candles, the bell and the censer. Upon the<br />
second altar lies the priestess or suitable candidate. On the<br />
cubical altar in the center are a black candle, the chalice, the<br />
sword, and the book. In each quarter of the temple should be a<br />
black candle. <br />
<br />
<br />
The ritual begins with the priest standing in the center of the<br />
temple east of the cubical altar facing west. The bell is rung<br />
nine times directed at the quarters in a anti-clockwise motion.<br />
<br />
<br />
The priest takes the sword and turning counter-clockwise, faces<br />
the South. He then draws a banishing pentagram and pointing it in<br />
the center of the pentagram shouts ANATHEMA!<br />
<br />
<br />
Turning to the East he repeats these actions. He does the same in<br />
the North and in the West.<br />
<br />
The priest takes the sword and pointing it at the Baphomet sigil<br />
in the west, makes the following invocation <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the name of Shaitan-Aiwass ruler of the Earth, King of the<br />
World, I command the forces of darkness to bestow their infernal<br />
power upon me.<br />
<br />
Open wide the gates of Initiation and come forth from the abyss<br />
to greet me as your brother and friend! Move and appear by these<br />
names!<br />
<br />
<br />
The priest now invokes the Demon Kings of the elements in the<br />
following fashion.<br />
<br />
<br />
He takes the sword and turning to the south, sword upright, he<br />
makes one complete circumambulation of the temple. As he makes<br />
his revolution he says the following :<br />
<br />
Through this, the back flame of Satan, I walketh in Hell, My<br />
senses are awakened to the joy of rebirth. The gates are flung<br />
wide and my passage is heralded by the deathless cries of His<br />
guardian Beasts. His searing brand shall be evermore emblazened<br />
upon my consciousness: its fiery meaning shall set me free.<br />
<br />
<br />
When the priest once again comes to the south, let him turn and<br />
face that way. With the sword he draws an invoking pentagram.<br />
Pointing to the center of the pentagram he invokes:<br />
<br />
Shaitan Lord of the infernal fire, manifest in this your temple<br />
for <br />
<br />
your brothers have called you! The Lord of The Aeon Ra-Hoor-Khuit<br />
commands you!<br />
<br />
<br />
He then makes one complete circumambulation of the temple saying:<br />
<br />
Vapors of millennia which which Thou hast shared with Thy chosen<br />
flock are rekindled now to fill this chamber with Thy presence.<br />
We toll the bell in thy name (here there is a single tone of the<br />
bell administered by one of the participants) and thereby summon<br />
the whispering voices of wonder from all the regions of Thy<br />
Empire! <br />
<br />
<br />
When he comes to the East, he faces that way and draws an<br />
invoking pentagram. Pointing to it’s center he invokes:<br />
<br />
Lucifer, Thou bringer of light and wisdom, manifest in this Thy<br />
Temple for your brothers have called you! The Lord of The Aeon Ra-Hoor-Khuit<br />
commands you!<br />
<br />
<br />
He once again makes a counter-clockwise circumambulation of the<br />
temple saying:<br />
<br />
Revel in the shimmering glow from the hearth of thy heart, and<br />
make thy pact of devotion with all her children whose paws have<br />
tracked and learned the way of Belial!<br />
<br />
<br />
When he comes to the North, he draws an invoking pentagram.<br />
Pointing to the center of the pentagram let him invoke:<br />
<br />
Belial, Lord of the treasures of the Earth, manifest in this Thy<br />
Temple for your brothers have called you! The Lord of The Aeon Ra-Hoor-Khuit<br />
commands you!<br />
<br />
<br />
He now makes a final circumambulation of the temple saying:<br />
<br />
It is from this brine that all life springs forth. Within thee<br />
flows remnant saline seas, maintaining thy kinshgip with the<br />
denizens of the deep.<br />
<br />
<br />
When he has come to the West he draws the invoking pentagram.<br />
Pointing to it’s center he invokes:<br />
<br />
Leviathan! Great Serpent of the Watery Abyss, manifest in this<br />
Thy Temple for your brothers have called you! The Lord of The<br />
Aeon Ra-Hoor-Khuit commands you!<br />
<br />
The first key of enoch is now made from the center of the temple<br />
facing the west.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The Chalice is now raised toward each quarter saying :<br />
<br />
Greetings powerful and exalted Aeonic Lord, May your strength<br />
give us sustenance for the working of your Holy Magick! Grant us<br />
the induldgences of which we speak ! We have taken Thy Name as<br />
part of ourselves. We favor the justand attack those who would<br />
enslave us without pity or quarter. . By all the Gods of the Pit,<br />
I command that these things of which we speak shall come to pass.<br />
Come forth and answer to your names by manifesting my desires. <br />
<br />
The Priest now invokes the planetary energy of the working by the<br />
proper hexagram ritual. ( see appendix )<br />
<br />
<br />
The proper Enochian key is now recited according to the nature of<br />
the work.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Demon of the particular working is now invoked. The priest<br />
takes the sword and over the central cubical altar he draws the<br />
invoking unicursal hexagram of the planet of the Demon being<br />
called upon. He replaces the sword and takes the seal of the<br />
Demon .Take the seal of the demon upon which the ritual goal has<br />
been written on the reverse, and lift it toward the sigil of<br />
Baphomet with both hands and say:<br />
<br />
<br />
Thou powerful and great __________________appear now before us<br />
and lend us thy aid. By the Infinite power invested in us by the<br />
blessings of Nuit, we call Thee and do command Thy presence. By<br />
the majestic name Shaitan-Aiwass and by the power of this sigil<br />
which is Thy true name, we do ask thy aid in<br />
________________________________. By the sign of our earthly<br />
heritage do we call upon thee as our brother and friend.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A proper invocation of purpose is now made by the priest. At this<br />
time the magickal work proper is accomplished. It is at this<br />
point that the goal of the rite must be acted out in some<br />
symbolic way. The purpose of this is to vent the psyche from all<br />
feelings connected with the work. If it is a rite of destruction<br />
, the victim must be symbolically represented, given life and<br />
then destroyed. If it is one of lust the victim must be conjured<br />
in image and the desired act carried out with exalted force. If<br />
one of riches one must create them about oneself symbolically.<br />
The Satanic Bible gives detailed instruction on the performance<br />
of satanic sorcery. However the concepts there taught are<br />
traditional methods.<br />
<br />
<br />
The seal with the desire is now burned in the censer as the group<br />
chants Hail name of demon ! Hail Shaitan Aiwass!<br />
<br />
<br />
The Ninteenth Enochian Key is now said . The priest now performs<br />
the banishing rituals and the bell is rung nine times counter-clockwise<br />
toward the quarters. The lights are now extinguished and the<br />
temple remains in silence and darkness for a few moments. With<br />
the switching on of an electrical light the ceremony is completed.<br />
In Satanick Magick banishing rituals are used to rid the ritual<br />
area of residual energy left over from prievious rites. They are<br />
also used as a daily “toner” for the magician. Daily<br />
use will result in an increased abillity to raise, direct and<br />
control magickal energy. Another benefit is that they rid the<br />
personal energy from the residue of others. It is highly<br />
recommended that the practitioner work out a daily routine<br />
according to his needs that is geared toward his magickal<br />
advancement. By this is meant solid practical work and not the<br />
mystical “white light” practices of the common westerrn<br />
magician. These practices may have their value in context with<br />
their own individual systems, but for the Satanick Magickian who<br />
is focused on the here and now, and the aquisition of true<br />
magickal power , these are useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
The two banishing rituals that are presented here are based on<br />
the traditional pentagram and hexagram rites of The Golden Dawn.<br />
However they have been re-written for the New Aeon and<br />
incorporate Thelemic symbology. The God-symbols in these rites<br />
are archetypal images of certain concepts of Space and Time. The<br />
Thelemic Cosmology cannot be explained in a work of the present<br />
sort. Space will not allow it. It is therefore recommended that<br />
before the practitioner begins to work with the following rituals<br />
he look into at least the basics of the Thelemic Pantheon.<br />
However for the reader who is unfamiliar with this concept We<br />
present an excerpt from Aleister Crowley’s “Magick”<br />
<br />
<br />
There are three main theories of the Universe; Dualism, Monism<br />
and Nihilism All are reconciled and unified in the theory which<br />
we shall now set forth.<br />
<br />
Infinite space is called the goddess NUIT, while the infinitely<br />
small and atomic yet omnipresent point is called HADIT. These are<br />
unmanifest. One conjunction of these infinites is called RA-HOOR-KHUIT,<br />
More correctly, HERU-RA-HA, to include HOOR-PAAR-KRAAT ,a unity<br />
which includes and heads all things. This profoundly mystical<br />
conception is based upon actual spiritual experience, but the<br />
trained reason can reach a reflection of this idea by the method<br />
of logical contradiction which ends in reason transcending itself..<br />
<br />
&quot;Unity&quot; transcends &quot;consciousness&quot;. It is<br />
above all division. The Father of thought --- the Word --- is<br />
called Chaos --- the dyad. The number Three, the Mother, is<br />
called Babalon.<br />
<br />
This triad is essentially unity, in a manner transcending reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of the two banishing rites presented, the second, The Nu-Ritual<br />
of the Hexagram is formulated for the advanced Magickian and<br />
should not be used until the concepts implied by the ritual are<br />
assimilated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also included is a ritual titled Liber Ad Lux Nuit. This is a<br />
modern variation of the Middle Pillar ritual with a slightly<br />
different implication. It creates true ballance within the energy<br />
system of the magickian. It is the daily practice of this rite<br />
that will truely build magickal power. A recommended routine is<br />
the performance first of the ritual of the Pentagram, then the<br />
ritual of the Hexagram. This should be followed with the<br />
traditional invocation to “Satan” and calling of the<br />
Secret Doors mentioned in Liber Legis, the Holy Book of the<br />
Thelemic Religion as well as a practical guidefor Thelemic Magick.<br />
. After this begin doing the Middle Pillar Ritual. Close with an<br />
adoration unto the Lord of the Earth. This little routine<br />
practiced daily will keep the energy clean and sharp and keep it’s<br />
level at a high pitch therefore increasing greatly the chances of<br />
success in your personal rituals and magickal goals.<br />

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;<i>An Instruction in the<br />
Invokation of Planetary Forces</i>&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
It has been the experience of the Author that when a Hexagram is<br />
used as a method of invoking Planetary forces, the energy invoked<br />
is either passive or active depending on the dignity of the<br />
planet in question. This energy is then programmed and the proper<br />
portal opened with the formula used in the planetary invokation<br />
proper. In the old system ( i.e. pre-Thelemic) the operator is<br />
required to learn fourteen hexagrams. Seven to invoke and seven<br />
to banish. The Advent of the New Aeon or 93 Current has made this<br />
task much easier not to mention more effective. Instead of using<br />
a traditional hexagram of Earth, the Unicursal Hexagram is used.<br />
One hexagram and only four forms. One to invoke active or Solar<br />
energy , one to banish the same. One to invoke passive energy and<br />
one to banish the same. The concept is this. If a planet is of an<br />
active element, to invoke ,the Solar invoking Unicursal is used.<br />
If the planet is of a passive element then the Lunar Unicursal is<br />
used. In either case the hexagram is charged with the formula of<br />
Abrahadabra. Now the elemental basis has been formed for the<br />
manifestation of the planetary energy. To invoke the planetary<br />
energy, draw at the center of the hexagram the sigil of the demon<br />
that you wish to invoke and charge with the proper name or<br />
formula. This is accessed by the higher magico-energic structure<br />
of the New Aeon.<br />
<br />
The sigils of the demons used in the planetary<br />
invokation in conjunction with the hexagrams are different from<br />
the seals used in the ritual. The seals are made by taking the<br />
Anglo-Alphabetical Square and connecting the numbers that<br />
correspond to the letters of the demons name by their placement<br />
in the English Alphabet.<br />
<br />
The square used is thus: ( the letters V and U and the letters Y<br />
and J are merged to give us 24 digits in the square. It may be<br />
noted that this is a Solar square for it is 6 the initiated<br />
number of the Sun multiplied by 4 the number of the elements.<br />
Spirit is not accounted for in Satanick Magick )<br />
<br />
<br />
The Sigils are simply the planetary sigils of magickal tradition.<br />

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;<i>THE CHIEF SPIRITS.</i>&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
Lucifer: From Latin, Lux, Light, and Fero, to bear, - A Light<br />
Bearer. There is a name<br />
“Lucifuge” also employed occasionally, from Lux, Light,<br />
and Fugio, to fly from, - He who<br />
<br />
shuns the Light.<br />
<br />
LEVIATAN: From Hebrew, LVIThN (usually written Leviathan instead<br />
of Leviatan), -the<br />
<br />
Crooked or Piercing Serpent or Dragon.<br />
<br />
Satan: From Hebrew, ShTN, = an Adversary.<br />
<br />
Belial: From Hebrew, BLIOL, = a Wicked One.<br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;<i>THE EIGHT SUB-PRINCES.</i>&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
Astarot: From Hebrew, OShThRVTh, = flocks, crowds or assemblies.<br />
Usually written<br />
“Ashtaroth”. Also a name of the Goddess Astarte; Esther<br />
is derived from the same root.<br />
<br />
Magot: May be from Hebrew, MOVTh, = small stones or pebbles; or<br />
from MG, = a<br />
changing of camp or place; or from Greek, Magos, a magician.<br />
Usually written Maguth.<br />
Compare the French word “Magot,” meaning “a sort<br />
of baboon,” and also “a hideous<br />
dwarfish man”; this expression is often used in fairy-tales<br />
to denote a spiteful dwarf or elf.<br />
This Spirit has also been credited with presiding over hidden<br />
treasure. Larousse derives the<br />
name either from ancient French or German.<br />
<br />
Asmodee: Usually written “Asmodeus,” and sometimes<br />
“Chashmodai”. Derived by<br />
some from the Hebrew word “Asamod,” to destroy or<br />
exterminate; and by others from the<br />
Persian verb “Azmonden,” = to tempt, to try or prove.<br />
Some Rabbins say that Asmodeus was<br />
the child of the incest of Tubal-Cain and his sister Naafrfah.<br />
Others say that he was the<br />
Demon of impurity. Others again relate that he was employed by<br />
Solomon in the building of<br />
the Temple at Jerusalem; that he then attempted to dethrone<br />
Solomon, to put himself in his<br />
place; but that the King vanquished him and the Angel Gabriel<br />
chased him into Egypt, and<br />
there bound him in a Grotto. The Rabbins say that when Asmodeus<br />
was working at the<br />
building of the Temple, he made use of no metal tool; but instead<br />
of a certain stone which<br />
cut ordinary stone as a diamond will glass.<br />
<br />
Belzebud: Also written frequently “Beelzebub”, “Baalzebub”,<br />
“Beelzebuth”, and<br />
“Beelzeboul”. From Hebrew, BOL, = Lord, and ZBVB,= Fly<br />
or Flies; Lord of Flies. Some<br />
derive the name from the Syriac “Beel d’Bobo,” =<br />
Master of Calumny, or nearly the same<br />
signification as the Greek word Diabolos, whence are derived the<br />
modern French and<br />
English “Diable” and “Devil”.<br />
<br />
Oriens: These four names of Oriens, Paimon, Ariton and<br />
Amaymon,are usually<br />
allotted to the Evil Kings of the four quarters of the World.<br />
Oriens, from Latin, Oriens, =<br />
rising or Eastern. This name is also written Uriens, from Latin,<br />
Uro, = to burn, or devour<br />
with flame. It is probably from Uriens that a mediaeval title of<br />
the Devil, viz., “Sir Urien”, is<br />
derived. The Name is also sometimes written “Urieus,”<br />
from Latin, “Urios”, a title given to<br />
Jupiter as presiding over the Wind. Urieus is also derivable from<br />
the Greek Adj. “Eurus,<br />
Eureia, Euru,” meaning vast or extensive. By the Rabbins he<br />
is also called SMAL, Samael,<br />
which is derived from the Hebrew root SML, which means “a<br />
figure, image, or idol”. It is a<br />
name given in the Qabalah to one of the Chief Evil Spirits.<br />
<br />
Paimon: Is also frequently written “Paymon”, and<br />
sometimes “Paimonia”. Probably<br />
from Hebrew, POMN, = a tinkling sound or small bell. This is<br />
again derived from the<br />
Hebrew root POM, = to agitate, impel, or strike forward. The word<br />
POMN is employed in<br />
Exodus 28, 34; 28, 33; and 39, 25. Paimon is also called by the<br />
Rabbins by the title of<br />
OZAZL, Azazel, which is a name used in Leviticus with reference<br />
to the Scape-Goat. Its<br />
derivation is from OZ, = a Goat; and AZL, = to go away. It has<br />
frequently been warmly<br />
discussed whether the word in question means simply the Scape-Goat,<br />
or whether it signifies<br />
a Demon to whom that animal was dedicated. But in Rabbinic<br />
Demonology it is always used<br />
to mean one of the Chief Demons.<br />
<br />
Ariton: It is also often called “Egyn,&quot; or “Egin”.<br />
This name may be derived from the<br />
Hebrew root ORH, = to lay bare, to make naked. It may also be<br />
derived from the Greek<br />
word Arhreton, = secret, or mysterious, in any sense good or bad.<br />
Egin, may be derivable<br />
from Hebrew, OGN, = to delay, hinder, or retard. There may also<br />
be a connection with the<br />
Greek Aix, Aigos, = a Goat. This Spirit is also called by the<br />
Rabbins OZAL, Azael, from the<br />
root OZ, which means both a Goat, and also vigour, vehemence of<br />
force; thus having partly<br />
the same root as “Azazel”.<br />
<br />
Amaimon: Also written frequently “Amaymon”; perhaps<br />
from the Greek word<br />
Maimon, present participle of Maimao; and A as an enforcing<br />
particle; hence Amaimon<br />
would mean “terrible violence and vehemence”. This<br />
Spirit is also called by the Rabbins<br />
<br />
MHZAL, Mahazael, perhaps from the root MZ, = to consume, or<br />
devour. Amaymon is<br />
spoken of in the various mediaeval Magical works as being a very<br />
potent Spirit, and the use<br />
of a ring, with Magical characters to hold before the mouth while<br />
conversing with him, is<br />
recommended as a protection against his deadly,<br />
<br />
<br />

Sorry to say but all of that long post is descredited by the bible in a few simple verses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mt 12:26<br />
26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? <br />
<br />
Mk 3:26<br />
26 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.<br />
<br />
Lk 11:18<br />
18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub. <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Friends, Satan says alot of things, but they are all lies. Read your bibles, it will be the best &quot;weapon&quot; you could ever have against the devil and his trickery.</div>

It realizes mans need to express himself in the form of religion. It therefore makes existence itself that very religion. The practitioner of Satanick Magick understands that without earthly power he is at a serious disadvantage. It is the here and now that concerns him. He is upon this earth ,and upon this earth ,he must live.\n\n\nVery few scholars will argue that Satan is the 'Lord of the earth'. It is he that holds material wealth in his hands. The Christian is swayed from material and earthly goods by their God for this very reason. For, a taste of success would deter them from the bond of slavery that is characteristic of the Christian Gnosis. \n\n\nSatanism doesn't necessarily view Satan in the same way as modern Christian teachings portray Him. The Satanick magician's thought pattern is based upon scientific data. He views biblical myth as a picturesque teaching system and not as concrete history. For him Satan is Lucifer or Lux-ifer. His name means Light Bearer or Bringer of Light. This taken in context with the idea of Satan as the Lord of the Earth, we then see him as a magickal archetype of the Sun. The Sun is our light bearer and bringer of light. It is the engine of our very existence. Every life form on the earth requires the Sun as its main source of life. Therefore as upon the earth ,we deify the Sun as Satan ,the Bright Spiritual Sun. It must be said that this is not entirely in agreement with the system of Satanism that has been dispensed by Dr Anton Szandor LaVey. It is the result when LaVeyan Magic is integrated with the doctrines and teachings of another pioneer occultist, Aleister Crowley. As this book will deal primarily with practical Satanick Magick, the influence of Dr LaVey will play the prominent part. The works of Mr. Crowley are highly recommended reading for anyone who is serious about occult study. Many Satanists will disagree with this however, the authors firmly believe in the validity of the Aeon of Horus and the New dispensation administered by the Book of the Law. We are not LaVeyites, nor Crowleyites. Nor are we orthodox Satanists but Thelemites who have found great value in the practical system of magic set forth by Dr LaVey. A deeper study of the teachings of Aleister Crowley will be undertaken in the forthcoming volume Sextanik Magick: The Magickal Works of the Beast.\n\n\nThe creative platform upon which this system of magick is based lies in that we have taken a force that is harmonious with the intention of earthly magic and applied it in a manner in which it becomes a powerful symbol of the true God of Man, The Great Central Sun.\n\n\nWhen performing satanick magick you are establishing your own godhead by the identity of yourself with the central source of power. You invoke the energy that we call Lord of the Earth, therefore becoming that energy and in the name of that force manifesting the will from the elemental powers that you have raised. \n\n\nIn this book we will be examining the magical system of modern day Satanism of Dr LaVey in the light of the New Aeon Gnosis. It is a complete system of magic based upon personal experience and work of a legitimate Black Magickal Order. (G.O.T.O.S.) It is hoped that the reader will explore this system with an open mind. This is especially so if he happen to be an orthodox LaVeyan Satanist. It is firmly believed that by the integration of traditional magickal techniques and modern satanic thought, a very powerful system of infernal magick is created. With this in mind the student should find no difficulty in building a powerful and successful system for himself. The choice is yours and the door has now been opened wider than ever. This book will allow you entrance into that door to power. \n\n\nIt must be said however that even though this magical system has been well researched and a great deal of practical experience has been invested in its composition, there still lies certain dangers. Not those that one would naturally expect but dangers of the mind and more, the ego. Remember the law of the Satanist, 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you'. Power is no excuse for ignorance. And above all remember that the formula is love under will.\n\n\nOne common question that is asked is 'why not use the powerful names of God to control and compell the demonic forces'? The answer to this question is quite simple and best expressed by analogy. If you had the desire to make an employee of any given company perform some task, would you go to the supervisor of that companys competitor? No you would not. You would go to the employees boss. So when commanding the infernal forces, why would you use the name of the competitor? Would it not be easier to go straight to their boss? And who is that boss? Satan, not Jehovah.\nThe Temple should ideally be a rectangular room with as little\nwindows and natural lighting as possible. The walls should be\nuniform in color. Upon each of these walls, in the elemental\ndirections, should hang the Baphometic Seal of each of the\nInfernal Elemental Kings. This Seal is the sigil of Baphomet as\nused by the Church of Satan . You will need three seals of the\nsame size and one that is larger than the three. They are\nconstructed as such:\n\n\nIn the south the seal of Baphomet with the name Shaitan in Hebrew\n\nIn the east the same with Lucifer\n\nIn the north the same with Belial\n\nAnd in the west the large one with the customary Leviathan. Upon\nthis Baphomet Seal, include a third eye. \n\n\n\nAbove this is the Stele of Revealing. This is the Supreme\nMagickal Talisman of the New Aeon. It is the Egregore manifest in\nthe sphere of Malkuth. Nothing whatsoever is to be placed above\nthe Stele.\n\n\n\nIn the South, East and North, to be placed upon erect square\npillars, is a single black candle. Also the candle color could\nmatch the element however, black is recommended.\n\n\n\n<font color=\"#800000\">The Altar<\/font>\n\nAgainst the west wall is the main altar. It should be about four\nfeet in length and two feet in width. It stands about five feet\nfrom the ground and is covered with a black drape that hangs to\nthe floor. On each side of the altar stands a pillar. They are\nthree and one half feet tall , sides square and flat on top. They\nare colored black. Upon each is a large candle. The candle on the\nleft is black and the one on the right is white..Upon the main\naltar lie the censer on the left and the bell on the right. In\nthe center is another large candle, its color chosen by the rite\nitself. In front of this is another altar against the main altar.\nIts height should be that of the magicians waist. It is six feet\nin length and three in width. It is upon this altar that the\npriestess lies. During rites that require no priestess, this\naltar may serve as the altar of implements or ideally it should\nbe removed. It should be remembered that even if no living altar\nis used it still is representative of the Mother. She is a form\nof Babalon as Satan is associated with The Beast.\n\n\n<font color=\"#800000\">The Altar of Implements<\/font>\n\nIn the center of the temple should stand a doudle cubical altar\nof black arranged so that when one stands at it you are facing\nthe Main Altar in the west. Upon this altar is to be placed the\nsword, Chalice, Book , etc... \n\n\n<font color=\"#800000\">The Bell<\/font>\n\nAny convenient bell may be used in Satanick Magick. It is\nsuggested that it have a deep rich tone and not a sharp “ping”.\nThe chalice should be a large stemmed goblet. Chose one that best\nexpresses the greatness of the receptive vessel that it\nrepresents. A deco glass goblet is perfect. Silver may also be\nused. LaVey suggests that the practitioner not use gold and in\nthis we disagree. Gold is the necter of the Sun. It represents\nthe Will and signifies the “Kingly Man”.\nThe sword should have a sharp double sided blade that is straight\nand bright. The guard, hilt and pommel should be red guilt with\ncopper wire. Of course, any sword that expresses the dark\ninfernal power may be used\n* The student should study the Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey\nshould he wish to explore the implements from a strictly satanic\nviewpoint\nThe temple is set up as described in part one. Upon the main\naltar are the three candles, the bell and the censer. Upon the\nsecond altar lies the priestess or suitable candidate. On the\ncubical altar in the center are a black candle, the chalice, the\nsword, and the book. In each quarter of the temple should be a\nblack candle. \n\n\nThe ritual begins with the priest standing in the center of the\ntemple east of the cubical altar facing west. The bell is rung\nnine times directed at the quarters in a anti-clockwise motion.\n\n\nThe priest takes the sword and turning counter-clockwise, faces\nthe South. He then draws a banishing pentagram and pointing it in\nthe center of the pentagram shouts ANATHEMA!\n\n\nTurning to the East he repeats these actions. He does the same in\nthe North and in the West.\n\nThe priest takes the sword and pointing it at the Baphomet sigil\nin the west, makes the following invocation \n\n\n\nIn the name of Shaitan-Aiwass ruler of the Earth, King of the\nWorld, I command the forces of darkness to bestow their infernal\npower upon me.\n\nOpen wide the gates of Initiation and come forth from the abyss\nto greet me as your brother and friend! Move and appear by these\nnames!\n\n\nThe priest now invokes the Demon Kings of the elements in the\nfollowing fashion.\n\n\nHe takes the sword and turning to the south, sword upright, he\nmakes one complete circumambulation of the temple. As he makes\nhis revolution he says the following :\n\nThrough this, the back flame of Satan, I walketh in Hell, My\nsenses are awakened to the joy of rebirth. The gates are flung\nwide and my passage is heralded by the deathless cries of His\nguardian Beasts. His searing brand shall be evermore emblazened\nupon my consciousness: its fiery meaning shall set me free.\n\n\nWhen the priest once again comes to the south, let him turn and\nface that way. With the sword he draws an invoking pentagram.\nPointing to the center of the pentagram he invokes:\n\nShaitan Lord of the infernal fire, manifest in this your temple\nfor \n\nyour brothers have called you! The Lord of The Aeon Ra-Hoor-Khuit\ncommands you!\n\n\nHe then makes one complete circumambulation of the temple saying:\n\nVapors of millennia which which Thou hast shared with Thy chosen\nflock are rekindled now to fill this chamber with Thy presence.\nWe toll the bell in thy name (here there is a single tone of the\nbell administered by one of the participants) and thereby summon\nthe whispering voices of wonder from all the regions of Thy\nEmpire! \n\n\nWhen he comes to the East, he faces that way and draws an\ninvoking pentagram. Pointing to it’s center he invokes:\n\nLucifer, Thou bringer of light and wisdom, manifest in this Thy\nTemple for your brothers have called you! The Lord of The Aeon Ra-Hoor-Khuit\ncommands you!\n\n\nHe once again makes a counter-clockwise circumambulation of the\ntemple saying:\n\nRevel in the shimmering glow from the hearth of thy heart, and\nmake thy pact of devotion with all her children whose paws have\ntracked and learned the way of Belial!\n\n\nWhen he comes to the North, he draws an invoking pentagram.\nPointing to the center of the pentagram let him invoke:\n\nBelial, Lord of the treasures of the Earth, manifest in this Thy\nTemple for your brothers have called you! The Lord of The Aeon Ra-Hoor-Khuit\ncommands you!\n\n\nHe now makes a final circumambulation of the temple saying:\n\nIt is from this brine that all life springs forth. Within thee\nflows remnant saline seas, maintaining thy kinshgip with the\ndenizens of the deep.\n\n\nWhen he has come to the West he draws the invoking pentagram.\nPointing to it’s center he invokes:\n\nLeviathan! Great Serpent of the Watery Abyss, manifest in this\nThy Temple for your brothers have called you! The Lord of The\nAeon Ra-Hoor-Khuit commands you!\n\nThe first key of enoch is now made from the center of the temple\nfacing the west.\n\nOl sonuf vaoresaji goho IAD balata, elanusaha caelazod: sobrazod-ol\nRorary I ta nazodapesad, Giraa ta maelperiji, das hoel-qaa\nnotahoa zodimezod od comemahe ta nobeloha zodien: soba tahil\nginonupe pereje aladi, das vaurebes obolehe giresam. Casarem\nohorela caba Pire: das zodonurenusagi cab: erem Iadanhe. Pilahe\nfarezodem zodenurezoda adana gono vepe zodomeda poamal, od bogira\naai ta piape Piamoel od Voan! Zodacare, eca od zoderamanu! Odo\ncical Qaa: zodoreje lape zodiredo Noco Mada, hoathahe Saitan.\n\n\nThe Chalice is now raised toward each quarter saying :\n\nGreetings powerful and exalted Aeonic Lord, May your strength\ngive us sustenance for the working of your Holy Magick! Grant us\nthe induldgences of which we speak ! We have taken Thy Name as\npart of ourselves. We favor the justand attack those who would\nenslave us without pity or quarter. . By all the Gods of the Pit,\nI command that these things of which we speak shall come to pass.\nCome forth and answer to your names by manifesting my desires. \n\nThe Priest now invokes the planetary energy of the working by the\nproper hexagram ritual. ( see appendix )\n\n\nThe proper Enochian key is now recited according to the nature of\nthe work.\n\n\nThe Demon of the particular working is now invoked. The priest\ntakes the sword and over the central cubical altar he draws the\ninvoking unicursal hexagram of the planet of the Demon being\ncalled upon. He replaces the sword and takes the seal of the\nDemon .Take the seal of the demon upon which the ritual goal has\nbeen written on the reverse, and lift it toward the sigil of\nBaphomet with both hands and say:\n\n\nThou powerful and great __________________appear now before us\nand lend us thy aid. By the Infinite power invested in us by the\nblessings of Nuit, we call Thee and do command Thy presence. By\nthe majestic name Shaitan-Aiwass and by the power of this sigil\nwhich is Thy true name, we do ask thy aid in\n________________________________. By the sign of our earthly\nheritage do we call upon thee as our brother and friend.\n\n\n\n\nA proper invocation of purpose is now made by the priest. At this\ntime the magickal work proper is accomplished. It is at this\npoint that the goal of the rite must be acted out in some\nsymbolic way. The purpose of this is to vent the psyche from all\nfeelings connected with the work. If it is a rite of destruction\n, the victim must be symbolically represented, given life and\nthen destroyed. If it is one of lust the victim must be conjured\nin image and the desired act carried out with exalted force. If\none of riches one must create them about oneself symbolically.\nThe Satanic Bible gives detailed instruction on the performance\nof satanic sorcery. However the concepts there taught are\ntraditional methods.\n\n\nThe seal with the desire is now burned in the censer as the group\nchants Hail name of demon ! Hail Shaitan Aiwass!\n\n\nThe Ninteenth Enochian Key is now said . The priest now performs\nthe banishing rituals and the bell is rung nine times counter-clockwise\ntoward the quarters. The lights are now extinguished and the\ntemple remains in silence and darkness for a few moments. With\nthe switching on of an electrical light the ceremony is completed.\nIn Satanick Magick banishing rituals are used to rid the ritual\narea of residual energy left over from prievious rites. They are\nalso used as a daily “toner” for the magician. Daily\nuse will result in an increased abillity to raise, direct and\ncontrol magickal energy. Another benefit is that they rid the\npersonal energy from the residue of others. It is highly\nrecommended that the practitioner work out a daily routine\naccording to his needs that is geared toward his magickal\nadvancement. By this is meant solid practical work and not the\nmystical “white light” practices of the common westerrn\nmagician. These practices may have their value in context with\ntheir own individual systems, but for the Satanick Magickian who\nis focused on the here and now, and the aquisition of true\nmagickal power , these are useless.\n\n\nThe two banishing rituals that are presented here are based on\nthe traditional pentagram and hexagram rites of The Golden Dawn.\nHowever they have been re-written for the New Aeon and\nincorporate Thelemic symbology. The God-symbols in these rites\nare archetypal images of certain concepts of Space and Time. The\nThelemic Cosmology cannot be explained in a work of the present\nsort. Space will not allow it. It is therefore recommended that\nbefore the practitioner begins to work with the following rituals\nhe look into at least the basics of the Thelemic Pantheon.\nHowever for the reader who is unfamiliar with this concept We\npresent an excerpt from Aleister Crowley’s “Magick”\n\n\nThere are three main theories of the Universe; Dualism, Monism\nand Nihilism All are reconciled and unified in the theory which\nwe shall now set forth.\n\nInfinite space is called the goddess NUIT, while the infinitely\nsmall and atomic yet omnipresent point is called HADIT. These are\nunmanifest. One conjunction of these infinites is called RA-HOOR-KHUIT,\nMore correctly, HERU-RA-HA, to include HOOR-PAAR-KRAAT ,a unity\nwhich includes and heads all things. This profoundly mystical\nconception is based upon actual spiritual experience, but the\ntrained reason can reach a reflection of this idea by the method\nof logical contradiction which ends in reason transcending itself..\n\n\"Unity\" transcends \"consciousness\". It is\nabove all division. The Father of thought --- the Word --- is\ncalled Chaos --- the dyad. The number Three, the Mother, is\ncalled Babalon.\n\nThis triad is essentially unity, in a manner transcending reason.\n\n\n\nOf the two banishing rites presented, the second, The Nu-Ritual\nof the Hexagram is formulated for the advanced Magickian and\nshould not be used until the concepts implied by the ritual are\nassimilated.\n\n\nAlso included is a ritual titled Liber Ad Lux Nuit. This is a\nmodern variation of the Middle Pillar ritual with a slightly\ndifferent implication. It creates true ballance within the energy\nsystem of the magickian. It is the daily practice of this rite\nthat will truely build magickal power. A recommended routine is\nthe performance first of the ritual of the Pentagram, then the\nritual of the Hexagram. This should be followed with the\ntraditional invocation to “Satan” and calling of the\nSecret Doors mentioned in Liber Legis, the Holy Book of the\nThelemic Religion as well as a practical guidefor Thelemic Magick.\n. After this begin doing the Middle Pillar Ritual. Close with an\nadoration unto the Lord of the Earth. This little routine\npracticed daily will keep the energy clean and sharp and keep it’s\nlevel at a high pitch therefore increasing greatly the chances of\nsuccess in your personal rituals and magickal goals.\n\n\nThe Solar Cross\n\ni.

This energy is then programmed and the proper\nportal opened with the formula used in the planetary invokation\nproper. In the old system ( i.e. pre-Thelemic) the operator is\nrequired to learn fourteen hexagrams. Seven to invoke and seven\nto banish. The Advent of the New Aeon or 93 Current has made this\ntask much easier not to mention more effective. Instead of using\na traditional hexagram of Earth, the Unicursal Hexagram is used.\nOne hexagram and only four forms. One to invoke active or Solar\nenergy , one to banish the same. One to invoke passive energy and\none to banish the same. The concept is this. If a planet is of an\nactive element, to invoke ,the Solar invoking Unicursal is used.\nIf the planet is of a passive element then the Lunar Unicursal is\nused. In either case the hexagram is charged with the formula of\nAbrahadabra. Now the elemental basis has been formed for the\nmanifestation of the planetary energy. To invoke the planetary\nenergy, draw at the center of the hexagram the sigil of the demon\nthat you wish to invoke and charge with the proper name or\nformula. This is accessed by the higher magico-energic structure\nof the New Aeon.\n\nThe sigils of the demons used in the planetary\ninvokation in conjunction with the hexagrams are different from\nthe seals used in the ritual. The seals are made by taking the\nAnglo-Alphabetical Square and connecting the numbers that\ncorrespond to the letters of the demons name by their placement\nin the English Alphabet.\n\nThe square used is thus: ( the letters V and U and the letters Y\nand J are merged to give us 24 digits in the square. It may be\nnoted that this is a Solar square for it is 6 the initiated\nnumber of the Sun multiplied by 4 the number of the elements.\nSpirit is not accounted for in Satanick Magick )\n\n\nThe Sigils are simply the planetary sigils of magickal tradition.\n<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\n7 8 9 10 11 12\n\n13 14 15 16 17 18\n\n19 20 21 22 23 24<\/font><\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\"><\/p>\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><font color=\"#800000\">The Planetary Daemons<\/font><\/h3>\n\n<p align=\"left\">\n<font color=\"#800000\">Lucifuge:<\/font> The Demon Lord\nset over the operations of Saturn is Lucifuge.

There is a name\n“Lucifuge” also employed occasionally, from Lux, Light,\nand Fugio, to fly from, - He who\n\nshuns the Light.\n\nLEVIATAN: From Hebrew, LVIThN (usually written Leviathan instead\nof Leviatan), -the\n\nCrooked or Piercing Serpent or Dragon.\n\nSatan: From Hebrew, ShTN, = an Adversary.\n\nBelial: From Hebrew, BLIOL, = a Wicked One.\n\n<font color=\"#800000\">THE EIGHT SUB-PRINCES.<\/font>\n\nAstarot: From Hebrew, OShThRVTh, = flocks, crowds or assemblies.\nUsually written\n“Ashtaroth”. Also a name of the Goddess Astarte; Esther\nis derived from the same root.\n\nMagot: May be from Hebrew, MOVTh, = small stones or pebbles; or\nfrom MG, = a\nchanging of camp or place; or from Greek, Magos, a magician.\nUsually written Maguth.\nCompare the French word “Magot,” meaning “a sort\nof baboon,” and also “a hideous\ndwarfish man”; this expression is often used in fairy-tales\nto denote a spiteful dwarf or elf.\nThis Spirit has also been credited with presiding over hidden\ntreasure. Larousse derives the\nname either from ancient French or German.\n\nAsmodee: Usually written “Asmodeus,” and sometimes\n“Chashmodai”. Derived by\nsome from the Hebrew word “Asamod,” to destroy or\nexterminate; and by others from the\nPersian verb “Azmonden,” = to tempt, to try or prove.\nSome Rabbins say that Asmodeus was\nthe child of the incest of Tubal-Cain and his sister Naafrfah.\nOthers say that he was the\nDemon of impurity. Others again relate that he was employed by\nSolomon in the building of\nthe Temple at Jerusalem; that he then attempted to dethrone\nSolomon, to put himself in his\nplace; but that the King vanquished him and the Angel Gabriel\nchased him into Egypt, and\nthere bound him in a Grotto. The Rabbins say that when Asmodeus\nwas working at the\nbuilding of the Temple, he made use of no metal tool; but instead\nof a certain stone which\ncut ordinary stone as a diamond will glass.\n\nBelzebud: Also written frequently “Beelzebub”, “Baalzebub”,\n“Beelzebuth”, and\n“Beelzeboul”. From Hebrew, BOL, = Lord, and ZBVB,= Fly\nor Flies; Lord of Flies. Some\nderive the name from the Syriac “Beel d’Bobo,” =\nMaster of Calumny, or nearly the same\nsignification as the Greek word Diabolos, whence are derived the\nmodern French and\nEnglish “Diable” and “Devil”.\n\nOriens: These four names of Oriens, Paimon, Ariton and\nAmaymon,are usually\nallotted to the Evil Kings of the four quarters of the World.\nOriens, from Latin, Oriens, =\nrising or Eastern. This name is also written Uriens, from Latin,\nUro, = to burn, or devour\nwith flame. It is probably from Uriens that a mediaeval title of\nthe Devil, viz., “Sir Urien”, is\nderived. The Name is also sometimes written “Urieus,”\nfrom Latin, “Urios”, a title given to\nJupiter as presiding over the Wind. Urieus is also derivable from\nthe Greek Adj. “Eurus,\nEureia, Euru,” meaning vast or extensive. By the Rabbins he\nis also called SMAL, Samael,\nwhich is derived from the Hebrew root SML, which means “a\nfigure, image, or idol”. It is a\nname given in the Qabalah to one of the Chief Evil Spirits.\n\nPaimon: Is also frequently written “Paymon”, and\nsometimes “Paimonia”. Probably\nfrom Hebrew, POMN, = a tinkling sound or small bell. This is\nagain derived from the\nHebrew root POM, = to agitate, impel, or strike forward. The word\nPOMN is employed in\nExodus 28, 34; 28, 33; and 39, 25. Paimon is also called by the\nRabbins by the title of\nOZAZL, Azazel, which is a name used in Leviticus with reference\nto the Scape-Goat. Its\nderivation is from OZ, = a Goat; and AZL, = to go away. It has\nfrequently been warmly\ndiscussed whether the word in question means simply the Scape-Goat,\nor whether it signifies\na Demon to whom that animal was dedicated. But in Rabbinic\nDemonology it is always used\nto mean one of the Chief Demons.\n\nAriton: It is also often called “Egyn,\" or “Egin”.\nThis name may be derived from the\nHebrew root ORH, = to lay bare, to make naked. It may also be\nderived from the Greek\nword Arhreton, = secret, or mysterious, in any sense good or bad.\nEgin, may be derivable\nfrom Hebrew, OGN, = to delay, hinder, or retard. There may also\nbe a connection with the\nGreek Aix, Aigos, = a Goat. This Spirit is also called by the\nRabbins OZAL, Azael, from the\nroot OZ, which means both a Goat, and also vigour, vehemence of\nforce; thus having partly\nthe same root as “Azazel”.\n\nAmaimon: Also written frequently “Amaymon”; perhaps\nfrom the Greek word\nMaimon, present participle of Maimao; and A as an enforcing\nparticle; hence Amaimon\nwould mean “terrible violence and vehemence”. This\nSpirit is also called by the Rabbins\n\nMHZAL, Mahazael, perhaps from the root MZ, = to consume, or\ndevour. Amaymon is\nspoken of in the various mediaeval Magical works as being a very\npotent Spirit, and the use\nof a ring, with Magical characters to hold before the mouth while\nconversing with him, is\nrecommended as a protection against his deadly,\n\n\n\nSERVITORS OF ORIENS, PAYMON, ARITON\nAND AMAYMON\n\nHosen: From Chaldaic, CHVSN, chosen, = Strong, Vigorous, Powerful.\n\nSaraph: From Hebrew, ShRP, = to burn, or devour with fire.\n\nProxosos: Perhaps from Greek, Prox, Proxokos, = a Kid.\n\nHabhi: From Chaidee, ChBA, or Hebrew, ChBH, = Hidden.\n\nAcuar: From Hebrew, AKR, = a tiller of the earth.\n\nTirana: Perhaps from Hebrew, ThRN, = the Mast of a Ship, also an\nApple Tree.\n\nAlluph: From Hebrew, ALVP, = a Leader, a Duke; also a Bull, from\nhis leading the\nherd.\n\nNercamay: Perhaps from Hebrew, NOR, = a boy, and ChMH a companion.\n\nNilen: Perhaps from Nilus, Latin, or Neilos, Greek, = the River\nNile.\n\nMorel: Perhaps from Hebrew, MRH, = to rebel.\n\nTraci: From Greek, Trachus, etc., = harsh, rude.\n\nEnaia: Perhaps from Hebrew, ONIH, = Poor, afflicted.\n\nMulach: Probably the same as “Moloch,” from Hebrew,MLK,\nto rule.\n\nMalutens: Perhaps from Hebrew, MOL, = to lie, or deceive, or\nprevaricate.\n\nIparkas: Probably from Greek, Hipparches, = a commander of\ncavalry, or leader of\nhorse.\n\nNuditon: Apparently from the Latin, Nuditas, = nakedness, derived\nin its turn from\nNudatus.\n\nMelna: Perhaps from Hebrew, LN, to abide or rest.\n\nMelhaer: Perhaps from Hebrew, ML, to cut off, or divide, and ChR,\nwhiteness,\npurity.\n\nRuach: From Hebrew, RVCh = Spirit.\n\nApolhun: From Greek, Apolluon, Apollyon, = the Destroyer.\n\nSchabuach: From Arabic = to calm or assuage.\n\nMermo: From Coptic, Mer, Across, and Moou, Water, Across Water.\n\nMelamud: From Hebrew, MLMD, = stimulus to exertion.\n\nPoter: From Greek, Poter, = a drinking cup, or vase.\n\nSched: From Hebrew, ShDD, the Hebrew name for a devastating demon.\nBut the\n\nHebrew root ShD implies the same idea as the English words “To\nShed” ; and signifies a\nfemale breast.\n\nEkdulon: Probably from Greek, Ekduo, = to despoil.\n\nMantiens: From Latin, Mantiens, and Greek, Manteia, Prophesying,\nDivining.\n\nObedama: From Hebrew,OBD, = a servant.
