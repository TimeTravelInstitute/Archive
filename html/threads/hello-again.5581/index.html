<br />
Well, it's good to see that amongst the many new names that have sprung up over the past four years, there's still some that I recognise. And from a quick skim through the forum, it seems like not much has changed. For those who do not remember me or have never heard of me, please go to this link to refresh your memories....<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.timetravelinstitute.com/ttiforum/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Board=time_travel&amp;Number=14934&amp;page=22&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=3&amp;o=&amp;fpart=1" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.timetravelinstitute.com/ttiforum/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Board=time_travel&amp;Number=14934&amp;page=22&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=3&amp;o=&amp;fpart=1</a><br />
<br />
I will put all that in a nutshell...<br />
Originally sent to November 2003 to try and coax John Titor out of hiding, my mission changed from Search and Recover to one of Observation of events pre 2006. During that time I imparted information to the general public on this forum about my life, a basic explanation of the workings of time and time travel (Above link post timestamp 11/23/03 02:54 AM), a correct catastrophe prediction (Above link post timestamp 11/24/03 02:25 AM) and in that same post, even some mis-information that I hoped would have got a reaction from a certain group of people. It didn't work.. but replace 2006 with 2011 on my date of birth and now it's all accurate. I also stated other things about the current state of your society and how you may think you are free, but you're not. How choices were being made for you without you even realising it. I talked about an internal &amp; external civil war in the United States that's being played out right now...... and I also briefly mentioned what we term 'The Great Catastrophe' but never really went into that much detail. Well, this 'Great Catastrophe' is the reason I'm here.<br />
<br />
When I first came onto this forum, the year 2003 from your perspective, much of the circumstances leading up of the 'Great Catastrophe' were unknown to us. Two Time Travel teams were formed to study and record events leading up to the 'Great Catastrophe'. I was a part of a team that specifically studied 1983 to 2004 which was commissioned in 2039 with all assignment finished by 2044. This team had four sub-groups. 1) Technological Surge of the 1990s; 2) Global Political Relations â€“ 1995 to 2004; 3) Climate &amp; Environment â€“ 1997 to 2004 and 4) Astronomical Observation â€“ 1983 to 2004. <br />
<br />
The Technological Surge Team's responsibility was to observe and record exactly that and how it changed the Global Human Consciousness. As you have probably ascertained, a major change in Global Consciousness began after internet use became more widespread from 1994. A mere two years after the internet started. Then, we observed and recorded the sheer speed of how technology not only evolved but became intertwined with nearly all aspects of everyday life. The team went on to record how Y2K significantly impacted the Global Consciousness and how its effects still exist today. And by the end of 2004, they documented the birth of Quantum technology.<br />
<br />
Simply put, the primary purpose of the Global Political Relations Team was to observe and record how the US peoples trust in the democratic process was broken and how this changed the world without many even realising it. The team observed what happened when the ability for you to make a choice was denied and what the consequences were of that fraud up until 2004. <br />
<br />
The Climate and Environment Team studied the Earth's rapid climate change from 1997 where it began to accelerate. Of course, you know this as 'Global Warming' and this was sold to you very well. Indeed, fossil fuels and the like did make an impact to atmospheric changes that were recorded from the 1960s leading to the 'Global Warming' theory but this was not responsible for the sudden changes in global climate that really started to kick in from 1997.<br />
<br />
Finally, the Astronomical Observation Group was charged with the responsibility of recording all relevant astronomical events including NASA &amp; JPL missions. Some functions of this group and the Climate &amp; Environment Group merged from about 2002.<br />
<br />
The second team was commissioned in 2040 and was sent to study various relevant aspects from the year 2005 up to the 'Great Catastrophe'. I do not know how this team was segmented specifically, but I do know there were a Climate &amp; Geological Catastrophe Team and an Astronomical Team among them. <br />
<br />
Finishing their mission in 2046, it wasn't for another 3 years that we truly grasped everything that took place. Let's just say the revelation was astonishing and I'm not specifically referring to the 'Great Catastrophe' itself. While it is true, the 'Great Catastrophe' was a significantly devastating event, the revelation of how the entire world was blinded until the very end and why this occurred was just shocking. It is something that we just could not fathom. And this leads me to why I am here.....<br />
<br />
As I've stated on my posts in 2003, Time Travel was developed as a learning tool, a way of realising humanity's past mistakes so they are never repeated in the future. Our ability to travel through time was co-developed with The Visitors following the formalization of the Technology Exchange &amp; Development Treaty in 2020 and is overseen by a Council made up of representatives from both species. (I understand that full disclosure regarding our cosmic neighbours has not happened but it is not far off.....)<br />
<br />
Anyway, until now, observation was our primary mandate and even though our interaction with you in circumstances such as this was frowned upon, most of the ripple effect would always be negated by the 'Great Catastrophe'. <br />
<br />
If you haven't read my posts from 2003, here is how I explained Time &amp; Time Travel and hopefully in a way that everyone can grasp... (Post Timestamp - 11/23/03 02:54 AM)<br />
One can travel into the past though, as this is &quot;road travelled&quot; by the universe already. (Think of it as) An endless rope stretching back toward infinity. It can be unwoven and rewoven. The past has been built and has grip knots in the rope or markers as such. <br />
<br />
A term I am sure you are all aware is the Space/Time Continuum. This is a name for stating that matter and energy may be in another place, or occupying a different space, depending on the time. That matter/energy leaves a trail, which is the continuum, over time. Imagine making a rope and various strands are matter/energy and the rope itself in its woven form is the continuum. <br />
<br />
Think of time travellers appearing now at this &quot;knot&quot; in the rope (continuum) of time. By being here, we have altered a single strand, at best. Does this significantly affect the rope as a whole? No. There is an effect but it is extremely low. The reason for this is because not a single strand of time has a great effect of the whole. Strands are interweaving and crossover. Essentially, any small changes will be muted by the crossing over of this strand with another as the rope continues. <br />
<br />
An example might help. (Please don't take this example as a warning!! It is only an example) Just say, I know one of the buildings in a major city that will collapse due to a minor build defect in the materials used. If I arrive at the point in time before the first foundation is laid and change the material used, the building will be okay. But say I arrive after the first foundation is laid and then change the material, it would essentially mean that I did make a change affecting that strand onwards but since the strand of that building had already started down a different path, over a greater period of time, it would mute my change..................<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to say is that at this point in time, depending on the action, we would have little to no affect to the final outcome of the 'Great Catastrophe'. But even a small change for better, even if it is for only a small group of people is something we believe worth doing. I'm probably not making much sense as yet, but please continue on.....<br />
<br />
After years of debate, the Council has for the first time authorised direct and deliberate manipulation of historical events in the hope that more survive what is coming. That all sounds big and dramatic but in reality our actions will be subtle and based on disseminating vital information during key periods. <br />
<br />
Our Team has four sub-groups. Based in Australia, my group has been assigned to this forum along with two others. We have the authority to disclose ourselves as Time Travellers and be open with our reason for being here. <br />
<br />
Two of the other groups are based on opposite sides of North America and have more direct contact with the populace while remaining totally anonymous. And, the final group is an Astronomical Observation Group based near the Cordoba Ranges in Argentina. <br />
<br />
Our Primary Mission is to assist with the information that is already trying to warn the general public about certain coming events. We do this because most major Governments in the world know, either by being informed by the US Government or discovered it on their own but they do not ready the populace and only themselves. They have no plans to inform the public as they fear losing the control they have over you and firmly believe their survival is more assured because they are counting on implementing Martial Law when they know for sure it's about to begin. The only thing they do not know exactly is when.... And this is our greatest weapon. <br />
<br />
Without disclosing the exact date, we believe the combined efforts of our team can have an effect on the survival rates particularly focussing on the country the cover-up stems from â€“ the US. Disclosing the exact date will allow the Government to plan Martial Law activities but by making as many people aware to the warning signs as possible, these people can act more swiftly when everything begins which will increase their chances of survival. <br />
<br />
The other 3 groups have orders to return to the future at a certain point in the 'Great Catastrophe' timetable. But my group will remain, releasing more and more information to help all those who will listen right up to when the internet shuts down. After that, we will do what we can to help those here in Australia. This is the point where Governments will want to impose Martial Law but it will be too late because the Military and Emergency Services will have their hands full.<br />
<br />
The coming posts contain information that will hopefully clarify what we are trying to achieve here. These posts will contain information about the past (from this point in time) and the future. But I must warn you....... A lot of what has been written so far in our initial communication and the words that follow will be debunked and ridiculed by many people. These people can be classed under two categories:<br />
1) Established and Deliberate Debunkers<br />
2) Reactions from people due to denial<br />
As some of you are probably aware, there are Government sponsored debunking teams that patrol internet websites and forums attempting to counter comments and assertions like the ones we are making. What happens on the Godlikeproductions forum is a perfect example of this. These debunkers are clever, structuring their comments to appeal to the denial people suffer when reading assertions like ours. And that brings me to the 2nd category: reactions by people in denial. Denial is one of our most basic reactions to a bad situation. Ever heard the term, 'IGNORANCE IS BLISS!' ...... Ask yourself if this is truly so....... and maybe this example will help.<br />
When I was here in 2003, I watched the movie Titanic and although it was obviously more fiction than fact, it did portray how people go into denial when initially faced with an undesirable situation. It wasn't until their fate could not be ignored that denial turned into panic to get off the ship. There are some parallels with the events that are coming.....<br />
<br />
Therefore, we ask that you consider our words for what they are and make up your own mind. We are not trying to force you to do anything....... we only want to help you prepare for what's ahead. I believe that this is something that humanity had to go through and I can truly say that the future I'm from is worth the struggle ahead. Even if our efforts here lead to a few more thousand people surviving, then it'll be worth it.<br />
<br />
In the next day or so, I will post a full summary of the Great Catastrophe and further explanation into why we can't just tell you the date.... but we will give you other information. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">This post will outline what the 'Great Catastrophe' is, the signs that exist now and how each region around the world will fare. <br />
<br />
The Great Catastrophe<br />
<br />
The Great Catastrophe is a term we sometimes use to describe the series of events surrounding the lead up to and climax of a large Planetary Body not native to our Solar System passing the upper breakthrough point of the solar system ecliptic where it will be in close magnetic proximity to Earth resulting in a pole shift. At this point the Anomaly temporarily overrode our magnetic alignment with the Sun. The Sun's magnetic influence responsible for Earth's orbital and rotational characteristics, ie: the 23.93 hour day and 365.25 day year as well as our four seasons. During the climax of this brief encounter, the highly magnetic region of the Earth's crust as well the Earth's core aligned itself with the Anomaly. This permanently changed the magnetic pole positions and caused rapid widening of the Atlantic and compression of the Pacific tectonic regions forever changing the face of Earth.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that many of you have heard parts of this theory before â€“ The Pole Shift theory.  But some of you might not have found what causes these pole shifts.  For those who have, you may have come across the Planet X theory. If not, a quick search of the internet can yield significant information on both theories with some much more accurate than others. <br />
<br />
Although the length of the actual pole shift event was quite small (less than a day) the medium and short term lead up events, starting many years ago, became increasingly dramatic. The period we're in right now is classed as medium term and has been since early 2006. <br />
<br />
Below is a basic rundown of the pole shift event and its affect on Earth followed by a brief summary of the local affects by continent.<br />
<br />
POLE SHIFT 101<br />
<br />
In the weeks leading into the shift, the rotation of the Earth slowed gradually to a complete stop. This is due to the Atlantic Ridge being highly magnetic, which was gripped by the Anomaly when it got close enough to Earth. Complete stoppage occurred about 5 days before the actual pole shift itself. The Atlantic Ridge is highly magnetic due to fresher lava flows and being centrally located between neutrally magnetic continental masses. When the rotation stops Africa, the US and Europe will experience a permanent variation of day with much of Asia in permanent dusk/night.<br />
<br />
The lead up to the shift and the shift itself causes the Altantic Region to stretch and the Pacific Region to compress/subduct. This process has been happening naturally via plate tectonics at a very slow rate for many thousands of years. Evidence of this is everywhere. Eg: Remains of forests on the US East Coast and evidence of civilisation now underwater in the Caribbean and west British Isles. <br />
<br />
Compression of the Pacific caused plates to be pushed under others which caused violent Earthquakes and rapid mountain building particularly along regions of the Ring of Fire. <br />
<br />
During the period of ceased Earth rotation, tension built up between the crust and core. Eventually the tension released when the core broke away from the crust and moved independently of it. Separated from the core, the sliding crust caused rapid Atlantic stretch and Pacific compression and changed the face of the planet. <br />
<br />
All that happened within a few hours and was an extremely violent event that caused near total destruction of the world cities and infrastructure along with billions of lives lost.  In addition to the earthquakes and volcanic activity there was massive tidal waves because the oceans are not fixed to anything and the crust moved through it at speed. <br />
<br />
After the pole shift, the core started to settle and realigned with the sun once the influence of the Anomaly was over but the crust continued to move due to its immense mass until the extreme quakes and mountain building eventually bought it to a halt. The face of the Earth changed forever and so began the time that I, and my team, grew up in â€“ the Aftertime and this was/is full of challenges. <br />
<br />
At the beginning of the Aftertime, the survivors were shell shocked because most of them were going about their normal routine almost up to a week before the shift! They struggled at first to understand what had happened. Everything around them was destroyed either by the Earthquakes, volcanoes, wind storms or tidal bore. Later, as reality started to set in and survival groups started to form, the survivors had to contend with another disaster. The oceans started to rise again due to the polar ice cap melt. <br />
<br />
For over a decade, everyday living was set back to the way it was in the 19th century. None your current infrastructure such as the power grids, sewage systems, communications and transit system survived. And although I cannot go into specific detail, suffice it to say without these things, people started (needed) to rely on each other in their small isolated groups all over the world. And then finally something good came out of all of what we went throughâ€¦.. without  main pressures in this time period, which all revolve around money, humanity spiritually evolved. We accepted what had happened and recognised what we lost was small compared to what we had gained. I probably made that sound a tad simple..... believe me, it wasn't.<br />
<br />
AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON YOUR CONTINENT<br />
<br />
The Great Catastrophe had a significant effect on seismic activity during and leading up to the primary shift event. This is due to a rapid separation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge which causes havoc all over the Earth. All well as changing traditionally predictable weather patterns into erratic ones. <br />
<br />
Widening of the Altantic Ridge caused subduction/compression in the Pacific. While this is only happening at slow and small increments right now, the shift caused it to happen at a much accelerated rate. Basically, Tectonic activity that would normally take many thousands of years got compressed into a few short days. As you can probably imagine, this will be an extremely dangerous period for everyone with some in more danger than others depending on their location.<br />
<br />
In top of all this, the Earth's core was magnetically pulled by the Anomaly which all culminated in a dramatic change in the current continental arrangements on Earth along with new magnetic pole locations. Here is a brief summary of what will happen by continent:<br />
<br />
EUROPE<br />
<br />
Europe was primarily affected by the Atlantic Stretch which increased volcanic activity both with currently active and inactive volcanos. Tidal bore was also significant in the low land areas and areas that lost sea level elevation. Earthquake activity was minor compared to other continents particularly those in proximity to the Pacific Region. Which means they were 7 or 8 and not 9.5's or higher like most other regions.<br />
<br />
Any country along the Mediterranean (particularly Greece &amp; Italy) and it's many fault lines, which was a tectonic stretch zone, suffered from increased volcanic and earthquake activity. As tectonic stretching is not a release of stress or tension, trapped lava exploded upwards through volcanos. Volcanic fallout was a substantial problem for nearly a decade after the shift.<br />
<br />
Spain, also on the Med, was permanently pulled down by approximately 15 metres due to the Atlantic stretch. This makes coastal communities a very dangerous place to be. England, Ireland and Scotland were also pulled down at least 20 meters.<br />
<br />
The Balcans mainly were affected by the volcanic ash from the Mediterranean.<br />
<br />
Switzerland, Finland, and the lower lands of Germany and France suffered greatly from tidal activity associated with the shift as well as fallout ash from volcanic activity.<br />
<br />
Sweden and Norway fared reasonably through the earthquakes and did not have to contend with tidal bore due to their high elevation but couldn't escape intense volcanic ash.<br />
<br />
Russia found itself in a slightly warmer climate after the shift but in its lower lands like Siberia and Ukraine, the polar melt put it all under water. Along with the rising water levels caused by the melt, rain fall also increased and the local rivers and creeks couldn't handle all the water. Much of Russia was in a perpetual flood after the shift.  <br />
<br />
MIDDLE EAST &amp; INDIA<br />
<br />
India &amp; Pakistan were forced under the Himalayan Mountains by the Australian plate due to Pacific compression. The earthquakes associated with this were very violent leaving few survivors. As a double blow, the crust rearranged positioned India near the new South Pole causing a dramatic change in climate. <br />
<br />
Nepal's climate also changed due to its closer position to the South Pole. <br />
<br />
Karachi was swamped by tidal bore due to low elevation but was made worse when its eastern side was pulled slightly downwards when India got pushed under the Himalayas.<br />
<br />
Iran &amp; Iraq are essentially now Polar Regions being that close to the new South Pole having been pulled away totally from the African plate.<br />
<br />
AUSTRALIA<br />
<br />
Australia dramatically changed due to the shift. Pacific Compression forced nearly 60% of the continent underwater due to the Australian Plate being connected to the Indian Plate. However, due to the sinking of Western Australia and most of central Australia, the eastern states rose up and had still gained land after the polar melt. This will also benefit New Zealand. <br />
<br />
The sinking of the western side of the continent was fast enough that the ocean just kept heading inland at a swift pace. There were very few survivors.<br />
<br />
Those who survived on the land that remains above water will find what was once East is now North and close to the equator. <br />
<br />
AFRICA<br />
<br />
For the most part, Africa remained above sea level even after the polar melt and the west side now faces north. Due to the difficult circumstances of living in Africa with it's people facing serious hardship, the survivors will mostly be no worse off after the shift and that statement is by no means a good thing.<br />
<br />
ASIA &amp; THE PACIFIC RIM<br />
<br />
China rode out the shift well. Much of China's land is high above sea level thus evading the shift tidal bore and polar melt. But China geographic position will be closer to the new South Pole and therefore changed its climate slightly. <br />
<br />
Hong Kong was destroyed by the quakes and tidal bore with the polar melt being the final nail in the coffin. <br />
<br />
The highlands of Taiwan survived the tidal bore and the polar melt but its proximity to volcanos from neighbouring countries rendered it a difficult place to live after the shift.<br />
<br />
Japan did not do well leading into the shift nor well in the shift itself. Due to Japan's position on fault lines, it suffered from immensely powerful Earthquake activity, some volcanic activity and massive tsunamis. <br />
<br />
Korea was basically destroyed due to significant Earthquakes, new volcanos followed by the tidal bore.<br />
<br />
Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia experienced significant Earthquake activity, tsunamis and tidal bores. But the end of these two countries was the polar melt.  <br />
<br />
Aside from the quakes and tidal bore destroying much of Singapore, its proximity to the South Pole froze the small amount of survivors. <br />
<br />
Guam, Fiji and the Solomans were hit hard by the compression quakes, completely washed over by the tidal bore and then swallowed by the polar melt. <br />
<br />
SOUTH AMERICA<br />
<br />
South America significantly changed due to the pole shift. This was primarily due to its new location in Earth's newly arranged continents. The bulge of Brazil found itself positioned very close to the new North Pole thus dramatically changing the climate after the shift.<br />
<br />
Aside from the large quakes associated with the Pacific Compression (which created the Andes Mountain range over time), South America had to contend with severe tidal activity in some cases much worse than other regions which simply devastated everything. The cause of this was due to a new land mass that surfaced out of the ocean due to the part Antarctic Plate rising up between the tips of both the African and South American continents.<br />
<br />
The rise of the new land mass forced the water away in all directions. This water went over most hills and some decent sized mountains and into the low land areas. An inland sea was present for a long time but is now slowly turning into an ice cap.<br />
<br />
Argentina, Buenos Aires &amp; Chile were decimated by the tidal bore from the Earth's stopped rotation, then followed by the rushing water from the new land mass surfacing. Don't think Chile is safer due to its higher elevation; the waves will be that intense and needed to go somewhere that it had the energy to go over some decent mountain ranges.<br />
<br />
The Andes will gain elevation over sea level from the pole shift due to Pacific subduction. It was a fair assumption for many to take refuge in the perceived safety of the Andes but for reasons yet completely understood many suffocated from oxygen deprivation. The current hypothesis is that the Anomaly stripped away some of the Earth's atmosphere enough to affect air levels at the Andes new height above sea level.<br />
<br />
THE UNITED STATES<br />
<br />
THE EAST COAST<br />
<br />
The East Coast from south of the New England area suffered during the shift due to the stretch from the Atlantic Ridge and the crust resisted being pulled apart so much of the coastal areas were be pulled down into the ocean. The level of sinking increased the further south you go. Only New England gained land due to the separating St. Lawrence Seaway but larger scale earthquakes were also present in this area.<br />
<br />
WEST COAST<br />
<br />
The situation is completely different on the West Coast. Firstly, the Pacific Compression forced oceanic plates under the continental plates along current fault lines. This happened with such force that heating of the substrata rock occurred and actually caused rock to melt in low laying areas. So remember, VALLEY + SUBDUCTING FAULT LINES = DEATH TRAP. Also significant mountain building occurred in certain regions. Think of Yosemite equivalent size to understand the sheer scale of the mountain building that will happen. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the tidal waves smashed the coast and went over the hills and mountains in close proximity to the coast line. <br />
<br />
CENTRAL<br />
<br />
The Central areas of the US generally fared well during the shift which was not its biggest problem. Due to the havoc on both the East &amp; West coasts, shift survivors headed inland and overwhelmed towns and cities that had trouble taking care of some many people.   Many more lives were lost due to these circumstances.<br />
<br />
ACTIVITY IN THE MEDIUM TERM LEADING INTO THE SHIFT<br />
<br />
The approaching Anomaly's effect on Earth has been gaining strength for at least the past decade but in the past two years, its influence has become more intense with many obvious signs. In fact, Earth has already started to slow significantly on her orbital path and a fact not being reported by NASA. The interference with her core is causing a number of things to happen.<br />
<br />
1)            Core reaction is generating increased heat output significantly warming up Earth's oceans. This has led to, among other things, accelerated Polar Ice melt particularly in the Arctic. The higher ocean temperatures are, in part, causing bigger and more frequent extreme weather events globally. This ranges from increased frequency of tropical storms to weather events not native to areas. Eg: snowing in tropical areas and extremely warm winter days in traditionally cold regions. <br />
2)            Abnormal core activity has also increased levels of volcanism and earthquakes  <br />
3)            A slight anomaly in the Earth rotation has already been noticed but not reported. I sure some of you would have noticed the sun rising/setting too far north for a period of time last year and earlier this year. This contributed to the erratic weather seen in a few years leading up to the shift.<br />
4)            One of the most obvious signs is how Luna is reacting to the presence of the Anomaly. This is something that you can easily observe yourself. Typically, Luna's orbit the Earth's equator with a slight inclination of 5 degrees and is something that is not very obvious to the occasional glance at the sky during the monthly orbital period. For nearly 4 years, Luna's orbit has been erratic and continues to be so. I suggest that you find a position in your house or just outside and line up Luna with a ground object like a tree etc. Over a period of just a few shorts weeks, you will see Luna move significantly away from your grounded object, either much higher or much lower and far greater than a small 5 degree inclination. This is primarily due to Luna having a second magnetic influence rather than just the Earth nearby.<br />
 <br />
At the present point in time, meteorological and geological activity is significantly increasing and will do so at a non linear rate until we enter the short term period before the Pole Shift.<br />
<br />
As I have already said, there are forces at work to keep you in the dark as to what is coming. The greatest advantage we have is that the Government doesn't know when the pole shift will occur either. And by the time the signs get blatantly obvious, they will be unable to fully implement martial law. The next post will outline political activities focussing on the US and explain how and why they are not warning you that this is coming. I will also briefly outline the active role the two teams in the US are doing in the lead up to the upcoming election.<br />
<br />
This leads us to the short term events leading into the shift which I will not go into yet but suffice it to say that when we enter this period, we WILL disclose full details and the exact date of the pole shift. We may release this information sooner should we achieve some keys goals in the next month or so.<br />
<br />
I do apologise as I said in my initial post that this post would only be a few days away but something came up which required our full attention. Expect the next post soon.<br />
<br />
Peace to you all.<br />
 <br />

<br />
What is your temporal divergence<br />
from you time line to ours. This<br />
will determine if your events will<br />
occur.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Temporal Divergence as currently defined although sort of on the right path is missing several key facts of the nature of the universe. If the universe on contained a single level then today's defintion of Temporal Divergence would be closer to the truth.<br />
<br />
But the universe does not have only one level. We do not know how many exactly but are aware of the two above us and we thank the Visitors for that as they come from level above us. Any changes we make in this level of the universe does not affect the other levels upward although we understand that is not necessary correct working downwards. Meaning, a higher level can alter lower levels. So while we freely admit we are here to change things knowing its causal effect, it is only the causal effect of the next 100 years from this point in time we are concerned with. This is because we know that within the next 100 or so years this level of the universe won't be our home anymore. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I won't live long enough to see the next level but what we are doing here now makes the journey to the next level easier. The more people that survive what is coming the better and as I have stated already, the choice will ultimately be yours when the time comes. What we learnt in the Aftertime is that most of us did't have the choice. You can't make an informed choice without knowing all the facts and it was the facts that were held back. We understand and accept that only a small number will listen and therefore become aware and that the way society has conditioned you will cause the vast majority to mock and ignore our message. <br />
<br />
So, basically the scale of the Great Catastrophe is that large the only way we could severly change the next 100 years would be to prevent it and that is impossible. Instead, we aim to lift the survival rate slightly as having children in the next two or so decades will be difficult due to the environmental conditions and stress associated with that. <br />
<br />
My next main post will be about the Government, particularly on the US Government, and how and why they are holding back the truth from you right now. Also, some of the methods they used to do it. We will also tell you what we are going to do to try and even the odds.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">Hi Timeline_39,<br />
<br />
I am from Asia and I have so many questions to ask:<br />
1. Are you saying that this is caused by planet X?<br />
2. Can we see it right now somewhere on earth?<br />
3. The Pole shift will happen in 2012?<br />
4. Are you coming from the same timeline as John?<br />
5. If such serious event happens and survival is extremely difficult, how can people start world war III few years later, as mentioned by John?<br />
6. Why did john mention almost nothing about this catastrophe but emphasize on WWIII?<br />
7. How long are you going to stay with us in this timeline?<br />
8. How can you know the details exactly what will happen when the world is almost completely distroyed?<br />
9. Is there anyone in this world now has identified the anomaly situation and released it to public?<br />
10. Did the government build all the underground bases because of this?<br />
11. You mentioned a few country names. Is that a reason you only picked those countries to mention?<br />
<br />
I do feel that the earth quakes and typhoons are abnormal this year. Also the economy in US is also abnomal. I strongly feel that the 'chaos' John mentioned have already come right now - a few years later than what he predicted since Olympic was completed.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Re: Hello again - 2nd Post - Government Cover Up</b><br />
<br />
<i>Apologies that I have not been around. I was needed in America to complete one of the stages of our mission........ </i> <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>HOW COME YOU DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS YET?</b> <br />
<br />
To understand what is really happening behind the scenes exactly, you need to understand who is in control of the world right now. We will focus on the United States as it is there where all this began and where the control stems from right now....<br />
<br />
Firstly, some history everybody should already know....... <br />
<br />
 <b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br />
<br />
The US Declaration of Independence was signed by Congress on August 2, 1776 which other than announcing the established 13 colonies of America were no longer a part of the British Empire it also declared Individual Rights and the Right of Revolution. Written into law, this essentially gave the power to the people via the democratic process of electing their Government representatives. This key event in history was done for the good of the people but the corruption of the philosophy did not take long to begin to erode the hard work of your Founding Fathers. The power of good continued though with Abraham Lincoln's objection to slavery leading to his Gettysburg Address in 1863. <br />
<br />
But not long after that, certain events began that ultimately shifted the balance of power from the many to the few and remained that way almost up until the Great Catastrophe. <br />
<br />
From the year 1874 to the mid 1890's, the world's first Corporate Powers were emerging and began influencing the Government to focus on their interests instead of those of the people. Their Power overcame the law. A separate Historical Observation Team, who specifically studied the late 19th century, documented the 3 main companies that ultimately spawned the Corporation Elites for the next 130 years to the current period. <br />
<br />
 <b>1)      STANDARD OIL COMPANY </b> <br />
<br />
Founded by J.D. Rockefeller and was a company that refined, transported and marketed oil. Standard Oil is considered by many to be one of the first multinational companies. They used highly aggressive tactics against their competitors and bribed those in Government they needed on their side. By the time the company was broken up the US Supreme Court in 1911, the corruption had already leaked into the US political landscape. <br />
<br />
 <b>2)      CARNEGIE STEEL COMPANY</b> <br />
<br />
Founded by Andrew Carnegie in the mid-1870's. This company continually funded campaigns of political figures that would implement policies that would be profitable for the company<br />
<br />
 <b>3)      WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC</b> <br />
<br />
Founded by George Westinghouse in 1886, Westinghouse Electric originally beginning with Electric supply/generation eventually moved into radio broadcasting, aviation (defence electronics), electric appliances, elevators, finance and finally to TV broadcasting (CBS). Throughout history, political bribes used to ensure the goals of the company were realised. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
You have probably realised, that these companies were primarily involved with the energy supply and building infrastructure for much of the 20th century. It is the people at the head of these, and many of companies, that people in this time period term 'The Elite'. But many people think The Elite are those in Government pushing the button but many do not realise that today, those in Government are pushing the buttons they are being told to push by The Elite that put them there in the first place. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <b>THE COVER UP OF THE GREAT CATASTROPHE</b> <br />
<br />
We call the upcoming Pole Shift the Great Catastrophe not only because of the devastation it caused to the Earth and the lives that were lost but also because of how it was covered up by your Governments to protect them and their Elite from having to deal with the general public. This left them in power up until the pole shift and the rest of humanity caught off guard. <br />
<br />
To completely go into detail here is impossible to due to the extreme extent of the Cover Up therefore I will give broad general overview and answer specific questions......<br />
<br />
The planetary anomaly was first detected and mistakenly (for the Government) reported by JPL to the public in December 1983 in the Washington Post. The IRAS satellite detected the Anomaly twice which was estimated to be about 80 billon kilometres from Earth and therefore was considered a part of our solar system. The story was later altered by NASA/JPL to counter their first conclusion of what the Anomaly was and this event is considered by us to be the first of the Cover Up.  NASA/JPL originally estimated Earth would be at critical proximity of the Anomaly in 2005 but later revised it to Late 2003.<br />
<br />
Most NASA/JPL missions were dedicated to tracking the Anomaly which proved difficult due to its erratic velocity and orbital dynamics. This included most of the probes they sent up, the extension of Hubble's service life and the control of nearly all ground-based telescopes capable of tracking the Anomaly. Shuttle missions were to build and ready the International Space Station for the Government &amp; Corporate Elite as one of the places to ride out the pole shift. Although, this plan was setback when the Columbia was destroyed during a mission in 2003 leading to the grounding of the Fleet until 2005. <br />
<br />
It became clear that the Anomaly would start to affect Earth long before the Pole Shift and several tactics were employed to counter them. Global Warming, largely dismissed by Government and Scientist for a long time, was suddenly accepted in the 1990's to answer the increasingly erratic weather and warming of the planet. It just takes some common sense to realise that the Earth's weather patterns are primarily influenced by the oceans which have been heating up especially in the past decade. Global Warming was initially used to explain the ocean warming and there were scientific models done on weather and polar melt. As the harsh weather and polar melt accelerate, to the surprise of scientists, Global Warming can no longer explain the ocean warming which is being caused by the core and its increasing reaction to the approaching anomaly. <br />
<br />
Earth's rotational characteristics have been changing since the late 1990's and the discovery of this has been countered by the manipulation of the clocks by the world timekeeper.... the US Navy. The internet made this very easy but for the past few years people have noticed the gap between their computer clock and wall clock. Covering the rotational changes has been harder to maintain for the US Navy which is why in the past two year there have been changes to the start and end of Daylight Savings.<br />
<br />
After attack on New York on 9/11/2001 (an interesting story in itself), Homeland Security which consolidated many Government agencies except the CIA and FBI, was setup. The primary reason for this was to make it easy to bring the US under martial law when the time was right which would have restricted the general public's movement while The Elite flee to safety. If you recall, there were many Homeland Security exercises conducted in 2003......<br />
<br />
The Cover Up was not only to keep the public in the dark. It was also used to try to secure valuable resources that The Elite could use to rebuild after the pole shift. This started with the war in Afghanistan which, under the name of the war on terror, the US secured the territory and therefore control of the Trans-Afghanistan Gas Pipeline which is a conduit for natural gas from the Caspian Sea to Pakistan &amp; India. <br />
<br />
Invading Afghanistan was simple because the Government claimed that is where the 'evil' Bin Ladin was residing who they blamed for 911. But as the year 2003, the estimated Pole Shift year, drew nearer they needed to secure oil. This led to the invasion of Iraq in early 2003 based on false claims of nuclear and biological weapons. And when the Pole Shift did not occur as predicted, the lies they had told started to surface.<br />
<br />
In the later part of 2003 the Anomaly moved close to the Sun and has not been possible to track from Earth since that time. We are guessing they thought the actual shift date wouldn't be too much past 2003. This meant they had to stay in Iraq until the Pole Shift and have manipulated everything and anything since then to maintain their position there even rigging a Presidential Election in 2004 to stay in Government. <br />
<br />
The sheer cost of the war was also difficult to hide and a tremendous drain on the economy. The US, continually borrowing money from China, even printing money weakened the strength of the US dollar. But in an attempt to hide all of this and keep them in Iraq longer, the Government relaxed certain regulations and turned a blind eye on other one for the financial sector. Lax, sometimes shady credit practices by finance companies and banks spawned the housing boom and kept the retail sector strong. This could only go on for so long though which bring us to the present time and the current financial crisis. <br />
<br />
The Primary Goal of the Bush Administration was to keep the public in the dark and secure natural resources so that they and The Elite would be in ultimate control after the pole shift. Obviously, there plans have not worked as they were working toward the wrong date but they are still ready to engage martial law once they know when the Pole Shift is. That is why we have said, their lack of knowledge is our greatest weapon.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <b>SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT FOR THE GOVERNMENT.......</b> <br />
<br />
History recorded that on November 4, 2008, Senator John McCain won the popular vote for President of the United States and was sworn into Office on January 20, 2009. There he was able to continue the previous Administration Cover Up and tried his best to do so. Martial Law implementation did not go as smoothly as planned because the Extreme Weather and Geological events got stronger and stronger before the primary Pole Shift events were obvious as the Military and Government agencies were exhausted from helping the public. The Government did not risk not assisting while the Pole Shift date was unknown due to what happened after Hurricane Katrina. But when it was obvious to everyone that something was wrong with the Earth, martial law went smoothly enough to restrict the movement to safety of millions of people in the US and around the world. <br />
<br />
In the end, the Government nor Elite survived any better than anyone else but the Great Catastrophe is that many weren't given the chance (nor choice) to survive by those who wanted to keep themselves at the top of the food chain after an event that ultimately levelled us all out. <br />
<br />
 <b>SOME CHANGES........</b> <br />
<br />
As already stated, our mission here is to lift the survival rate of the initial Pole Shift event which should flow onto higher total survival numbers after the rebuilding. I have already disclosed our group structure and their goals and have also stated that we will warn you on certain events. But here and now, we are going to tell you of a future event that we will be changing......<br />
<br />
As we have said, John McCain won the upcoming election. He won this narrowly and did so by voter fraud. As part of our strategy, we intend to change events so that Barack Obama wins by the margin which he originally should of...... a landfall. The majority our group is already positioned in the states that participated in the voter fraud to stop it from occurring. <br />
<br />
Having studied Barack Obama's psychological profile, we believe once he has been told, that he will inform the public about the Pole Shift. When we see what his intentions are after being briefed on the Pole Shift, we will make the decision on whether to expose ourselves and offer assistance. We anticipate this being so and should coincide with a couple of severe earthquakes in the region above Australia and the West Coast of the US not too long after Inauguration Day. (More Info as the time comes closer) <br />
<br />
 We understand that from this point in time, an Obama victory looks 50/50 as the current political polls don't include independents and also SMS respondents. The Republicans already know a win is unlikely and have setup voter fraud tactics (as they did in 2004) so that they are successful. <br />
<br />
Not this time around.......<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if this upsets those who are Republican but all I can say is that you need to trust us when we say you will be better off if McCain does NOT win.<br />
<br />
Peace<br />
<br />

</div>Question: Is a &quot;landfall&quot; supposed to be a measure hugely greater than a &quot;landslide&quot;?<br />
<br />
Analysis: Whereas Lyndzee (affectionately known as Ducky at the current TIME) only predicted a single future event, McCain wins, timeline_39 has now set up the perfect scam: He wants to have it both ways, and purposefully sets up his story to achieve just that.  No matter who wins the Prez election, timeline's story is &quot;covered&quot; and you should be equally wow'ed if either happens.  Because in one case it means he accomplished his mission, and in the other you would think the Big Bad Republicans just got away with vote fraud.  Either way, he THINKS (and has projected it) as validating his story.  When we all know it does nothing of the sort.<br />
<br />
What timeline_39 has done has been set up the very definition of an unfalsifiable claim (prediction, theory, etc.).  If they gave away points for subtlety of a TT'ers storyline gadgets, timeline_39's would be a negative score. Kinda like getting hit in the face with a salmon!<br />

RainmanTime,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your opinion. Remember that we have always stated that it is YOUR choice whether you believe what we say or not. <br />
<br />
I think maybe you need a clearer picture of what we seek by communicating this way on the forum....<br />
<br />
The primary goal of this particular phase of the mission is to raise awareness by giving information to the people that visit this forum. We predicated that the readers reaction/response to what we say would be classed into 3 categories:<br />
<br />
1) Those who accept and listen to what we say. Ask us questions and for advice and with their own instincts plan accordingly.<br />
<br />
2) Those who are in between neither totally rejecting nor totally accepting but having read what we have written become more astute (conscious) to what is really happening and will recognise the signs as they grow stronger. At this point, they will either move to totally acceptance or go into denial (reject)<br />
<br />
3) Those who totally reject what we say for whatever reason but would be usually due to a form of denial or some sort. <br />
<br />
We will NOT try and persude individuals away from there chosen course or else we would be no better than those who currently control your way of life. We will just continue to present the information and let the individual decide. <br />
<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />
<br />
Charlie</div>

			The planetary anomaly was first detected and mistakenly (for the Government) reported by JPL to the public in December 1983 in the Washington Post. The IRAS satellite detected the Anomaly twice which was estimated to be about 80 billon kilometres from Earth and therefore was considered a part of our solar system. The story was later altered by NASA/JPL to counter their first conclusion of what the Anomaly was and this event is considered by us to be the first of the Cover Up. NASA/JPL originally estimated Earth would be at critical proximity of the Anomaly in 2005 but later revised it to Late 2003.

 <span style="color: #ff0000"> Possibly as Large as Jupiter;<br />
            Mystery Heavenly Body Discovered<br />
 </span> <br />
<br />
 <span style="color: #0000ff"> By Thomas O'Toole, Washington Post Staff Writer<br />
Friday, December 30, 1983 ; Page A1<br />
<br />
A heavenly body possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth<br />
that it would be part of this solar system has been found in the direction of the constellation<br />
Orion by an orbiting telescope aboard the U.S. infrared astronomical satellite.<br />
<br />
So mysterious is the object that astronomers do not know if it is a planet, a giant comet, a<br />
nearby &quot;protostar&quot; that never got hot enough to become a star, a distant galaxy so young that<br />
it is still in the process of forming its first stars or a galaxy so shrouded in dust that none of the<br />
light cast by its stars ever gets through.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I can tell you is that we don't know what it is,&quot; Dr. Gerry Neugebauer, IRAS chief<br />
scientist for California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and director of the Palomar Observatory<br />
for the California Institute of Technology, said in an interview.<br />
<br />
The most fascinating explanation of this mystery body, which is so cold it casts no light and<br />
has never been seen by optical telescopes on Earth or in space, is that it is a giant gaseous<br />
planet as large as Jupiter and as close to Earth as 50 trillion miles. While that may seem like a<br />
great distance in earthbound terms, it is a stone's throw in cosmological terms, so close in fact<br />
that it would be the nearest heavenly body to Earth beyond the outermost planet Pluto.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it is really that close, it would be a part of our solar system,&quot; said Dr. James Houck of<br />
Cornell University's Center for Radio Physics and Space Research and a member of the<br />
IRAS science team. &quot;If it is that close, I don't know how the world's planetary scientists<br />
would even begin to classify it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mystery body was seen twice by the infrared satellite as it scanned the northern sky from<br />
last January to November, when the satellite ran out of the supercold helium that allowed its<br />
telescope to see the coldest bodies in the heavens. The second observation took place six<br />
months after the first and suggested the mystery body had not moved from its spot in the sky<br />
near the western edge of the constellation Orion in that time.<br />
<br />
&quot;This suggests it's not a comet because a comet would not be as large as the one we've<br />
observed and a comet would probably have moved,&quot; Houck said. &quot;A planet may have moved<br />
if it were as close as 50 trillion miles but it could still be a more distant planet and not have<br />
moved in six months time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whatever it is, Houck said, the mystery body is so cold its temperature is no more than 40<br />
degrees above &quot;absolute&quot; zero, which is 456 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. The telescope<br />
aboard IRAS is cooled so low and is so sensitive it can &quot;see&quot; objects in the heavens that are<br />
only 20 degrees above absolute zero.<br />
<br />
When IRAS scientists first saw the mystery body and calculated that it could be as close as<br />
50 trillion miles, there was some speculation that it might be moving toward Earth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not incoming mail,&quot; Cal Tech's Neugebauer said. &quot;I want to douse that idea with as much<br />
cold water as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, what is it? What if it is as large as Jupiter and so close to the sun it would be part of the<br />
solar system? Conceivably, it could be the 10th planet astronomers have searched for in vain.<br />
It also might be a Jupiter-like star that started out to become a star eons ago but never got hot<br />
enough like the sun to become a star.<br />
<br />
While they cannot disprove that notion, Neugebauer and Houck are so bedeviled by it that<br />
they do not want to accept it. Neugebauer and Houck &quot;hope&quot; the mystery body is a distant<br />
galaxy either so young that its stars have not begun to shine or so surrounded by dust that its<br />
starlight cannot penetrate the shroud.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe it's one of these dark, young galaxies that we have never been able to observe<br />
before,&quot; Neugebauer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it is, then it is a major step forward in our understanding of the size of the universe, how the<br />
universe formed and how it continues to form as time goes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next step in pinpointing what the mystery body is, Neuegebauer said, is to search for it<br />
with the world's largest optical telescopes. Already, the 100-inch diameter telescope at Cerro<br />
del Tololo in Chile has begun its search and the 200-inch telescope at Palomar Mountain in<br />
California has earmarked several nights next year to look for it. If the body is close enough<br />
and emits even a hint of light, the Palomar telescope should find it since the infrared satellite<br />
has pinpointed its position.  </span> <br />

I've been there several times myself, last time was actually in July. The base is located on a different side of the mountain than where the tourist area is located, and its strictly guarded and no one is allowed to be on the mountain after 4 in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
So, obviously, my curiosity is if this is the place timeline 39 is talking about?<br />
<br />
Could explain many things going on there at least.<br />

Two of the other groups are based on opposite sides of North America and have more direct contact with the populace while remaining totally anonymous. And, the final group is an Astronomical Observation Group based near the Cordoba Ranges in Argentina. <br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is indeed a very interesting place in Cordoba in Argentina (I live here), with a secret astronomical observation base, by a mountain that is well known for UFO observations.<br />
<br />
This place is called Cerro Uritorco and is located in the town of Capilla del Monte.<br />
<br />
There is actually a small notice about it on wikipedia:<br />
<br />

</div>The mission of the Astronomical Observation Team is to establish an secured and hardened installation to house various equipment which in it's first phase, will be tracking the Anomaly. The Cordoba Region was selected due to it's location in the Southern Hemisphere (which is where you need to be to track to the Anomaly), for it's elevation above current sea level and generally how the region will fair from the Earthquakes caused by the Pole Shift. The team has orders to leave well ahead of the Pole Shift date.<br />
<br />
The installation they constructed was designed to survive the Pole Shift intact which it can then move to phase two. After the Pole Shift occurs, the second phase of the mission commences. At a pre-set date and time, the equipment (assuming it survived) will attempt to locate any surviving orbital satellites and re-program them to create a sensor network which hopefully will cover the entire planet. Not many satellites survived as they were mostly destroyed by inbound debris but some did fall back to Earth. Once the sensor net is established, it will connect with the portable devices of those team members that are staying behind.<br />
<br />
Regarding the other observatory you speak of, the team has been careful to hide ourselves which initially wasn't easy I was told. We do not want to make contact with anyone from that facility due to who they are affiliated with.<br />
<br />
Regarding the UFO's...... It is a subject which I have not touched on yet in the public forum but am planning a specific post to explain UFO activity and the current Alien agenda in detail soon..... But in a nutshell, The Visitors agenda can be split into two primary phases. Pre-Pole Shift they will only establish links with contactees subconsiously and then at a point post-Pole Shift is when they will make face to face contact. Over the past few years, sightings of space craft has been gradually increasing as public awareness (and acceptance) grows despite cover-up and debunker efforts. The percentage of people who are contactees are also increasing. What is happening in the Cordoba region is that they are communicating telepathically and subconsiously to the people in the area and are saying that Cerro Uritorco is the place to go once the primary Pole Shift events start. Contactees further away are even being taken there and shown the best route to take from where they reside. <br />
<br />
I will elaborate more on the Alien presence in a later post but I hope this answers your questions.<br />
<br />
Peace<br />

Please find below the original post along with a new one after it.\n\nWell, it's good to see that amongst the many new names that have sprung up over the past four years, there's still some that I recognise. And from a quick skim through the forum, it seems like not much has changed. For those who do not remember me or have never heard of me, please go to this link to refresh your memories....\n\nhttp:\/\/www.timetravelinstitute.com\/ttiforum\/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=time_travel&Number=14934&page=22&view=collapsed&sb=3&o=&fpart=1\n\nI will put all that in a nutshell...\nOriginally sent to November 2003 to try and coax John Titor out of hiding, my mission changed from Search and Recover to one of Observation of events pre 2006. During that time I imparted information to the general public on this forum about my life, a basic explanation of the workings of time and time travel (Above link post timestamp 11\/23\/03 02:54 AM), a correct catastrophe prediction (Above link post timestamp 11\/24\/03 02:25 AM) and in that same post, even some mis-information that I hoped would have got a reaction from a certain group of people. It didn't work.. but replace 2006 with 2011 on my date of birth and now it's all accurate. I also stated other things about the current state of your society and how you may think you are free, but you're not. How choices were being made for you without you even realising it. I talked about an internal & external civil war in the United States that's being played out right now...... and I also briefly mentioned what we term 'The Great Catastrophe' but never really went into that much detail. Well, this 'Great Catastrophe' is the reason I'm here.\n\nWhen I first came onto this forum, the year 2003 from your perspective, much of the circumstances leading up of the 'Great Catastrophe' were unknown to us. Two Time Travel teams were formed to study and record events leading up to the 'Great Catastrophe'. I was a part of a team that specifically studied 1983 to 2004 which was commissioned in 2039 with all assignment finished by 2044. This team had four sub-groups. 1) Technological Surge of the 1990s; 2) Global Political Relations â€“ 1995 to 2004; 3) Climate & Environment â€“ 1997 to 2004 and 4) Astronomical Observation â€“ 1983 to 2004. \n\nThe Technological Surge Team's responsibility was to observe and record exactly that and how it changed the Global Human Consciousness. As you have probably ascertained, a major change in Global Consciousness began after internet use became more widespread from 1994. A mere two years after the internet started. Then, we observed and recorded the sheer speed of how technology not only evolved but became intertwined with nearly all aspects of everyday life. The team went on to record how Y2K significantly impacted the Global Consciousness and how its effects still exist today. And by the end of 2004, they documented the birth of Quantum technology.\n\nSimply put, the primary purpose of the Global Political Relations Team was to observe and record how the US peoples trust in the democratic process was broken and how this changed the world without many even realising it. The team observed what happened when the ability for you to make a choice was denied and what the consequences were of that fraud up until 2004. \n\nThe Climate and Environment Team studied the Earth's rapid climate change from 1997 where it began to accelerate. Of course, you know this as 'Global Warming' and this was sold to you very well. Indeed, fossil fuels and the like did make an impact to atmospheric changes that were recorded from the 1960s leading to the 'Global Warming' theory but this was not responsible for the sudden changes in global climate that really started to kick in from 1997.\n\nFinally, the Astronomical Observation Group was charged with the responsibility of recording all relevant astronomical events including NASA & JPL missions. Some functions of this group and the Climate & Environment Group merged from about 2002.\n\nThe second team was commissioned in 2040 and was sent to study various relevant aspects from the year 2005 up to the 'Great Catastrophe'. I do not know how this team was segmented specifically, but I do know there were a Climate & Geological Catastrophe Team and an Astronomical Team among them. \n\nFinishing their mission in 2046, it wasn't for another 3 years that we truly grasped everything that took place. Let's just say the revelation was astonishing and I'm not specifically referring to the 'Great Catastrophe' itself. While it is true, the 'Great Catastrophe' was a significantly devastating event, the revelation of how the entire world was blinded until the very end and why this occurred was just shocking. It is something that we just could not fathom. And this leads me to why I am here.....\n\nAs I've stated on my posts in 2003, Time Travel was developed as a learning tool, a way of realising humanity's past mistakes so they are never repeated in the future. Our ability to travel through time was co-developed with The Visitors following the formalization of the Technology Exchange & Development Treaty in 2020 and is overseen by a Council made up of representatives from both species. (I understand that full disclosure regarding our cosmic neighbours has not happened but it is not far off.....)\n\nAnyway, until now, observation was our primary mandate and even though our interaction with you in circumstances such as this was frowned upon, most of the ripple effect would always be negated by the 'Great Catastrophe'. \n\nIf you haven't read my posts from 2003, here is how I explained Time & Time Travel and hopefully in a way that everyone can grasp... (Post Timestamp - 11\/23\/03 02:54 AM)\nOne can travel into the past though, as this is \"road travelled\" by the universe already. (Think of it as) An endless rope stretching back toward infinity. It can be unwoven and rewoven. The past has been built and has grip knots in the rope or markers as such. \n\nA term I am sure you are all aware is the Space\/Time Continuum. This is a name for stating that matter and energy may be in another place, or occupying a different space, depending on the time. That matter\/energy leaves a trail, which is the continuum, over time. Imagine making a rope and various strands are matter\/energy and the rope itself in its woven form is the continuum. \n\nThink of time travellers appearing now at this \"knot\" in the rope (continuum) of time. By being here, we have altered a single strand, at best. Does this significantly affect the rope as a whole? No. There is an effect but it is extremely low. The reason for this is because not a single strand of time has a great effect of the whole. Strands are interweaving and crossover. Essentially, any small changes will be muted by the crossing over of this strand with another as the rope continues. \n\nAn example might help. (Please don't take this example as a warning!! It is only an example) Just say, I know one of the buildings in a major city that will collapse due to a minor build defect in the materials used. If I arrive at the point in time before the first foundation is laid and change the material used, the building will be okay. But say I arrive after the first foundation is laid and then change the material, it would essentially mean that I did make a change affecting that strand onwards but since the strand of that building had already started down a different path, over a greater period of time, it would mute my change..................\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that at this point in time, depending on the action, we would have little to no affect to the final outcome of the 'Great Catastrophe'. But even a small change for better, even if it is for only a small group of people is something we believe worth doing. I'm probably not making much sense as yet, but please continue on.....\n\nAfter years of debate, the Council has for the first time authorised direct and deliberate manipulation of historical events in the hope that more survive what is coming. That all sounds big and dramatic but in reality our actions will be subtle and based on disseminating vital information during key periods. \n\nOur Team has four sub-groups. Based in Australia, my group has been assigned to this forum along with two others. We have the authority to disclose ourselves as Time Travellers and be open with our reason for being here. \n\nTwo of the other groups are based on opposite sides of North America and have more direct contact with the populace while remaining totally anonymous. And, the final group is an Astronomical Observation Group based near the Cordoba Ranges in Argentina. \n\nOur Primary Mission is to assist with the information that is already trying to warn the general public about certain coming events. We do this because most major Governments in the world know, either by being informed by the US Government or discovered it on their own but they do not ready the populace and only themselves. They have no plans to inform the public as they fear losing the control they have over you and firmly believe their survival is more assured because they are counting on implementing Martial Law when they know for sure it's about to begin. The only thing they do not know exactly is when.... And this is our greatest weapon. \n\nWithout disclosing the exact date, we believe the combined efforts of our team can have an effect on the survival rates particularly focussing on the country the cover-up stems from â€“ the US. Disclosing the exact date will allow the Government to plan Martial Law activities but by making as many people aware to the warning signs as possible, these people can act more swiftly when everything begins which will increase their chances of survival. \n\nThe other 3 groups have orders to return to the future at a certain point in the 'Great Catastrophe' timetable. But my group will remain, releasing more and more information to help all those who will listen right up to when the internet shuts down. After that, we will do what we can to help those here in Australia. This is the point where Governments will want to impose Martial Law but it will be too late because the Military and Emergency Services will have their hands full.\n\nThe coming posts contain information that will hopefully clarify what we are trying to achieve here. These posts will contain information about the past (from this point in time) and the future. But I must warn you....... A lot of what has been written so far in our initial communication and the words that follow will be debunked and ridiculed by many people. These people can be classed under two categories:\n1) Established and Deliberate Debunkers\n2) Reactions from people due to denial\nAs some of you are probably aware, there are Government sponsored debunking teams that patrol internet websites and forums attempting to counter comments and assertions like the ones we are making. What happens on the Godlikeproductions forum is a perfect example of this. These debunkers are clever, structuring their comments to appeal to the denial people suffer when reading assertions like ours. And that brings me to the 2nd category: reactions by people in denial. Denial is one of our most basic reactions to a bad situation. Ever heard the term, 'IGNORANCE IS BLISS!' ...... Ask yourself if this is truly so....... and maybe this example will help.\nWhen I was here in 2003, I watched the movie Titanic and although it was obviously more fiction than fact, it did portray how people go into denial when initially faced with an undesirable situation. It wasn't until their fate could not be ignored that denial turned into panic to get off the ship. There are some parallels with the events that are coming.....\n\nTherefore, we ask that you consider our words for what they are and make up your own mind. We are not trying to force you to do anything....... we only want to help you prepare for what's ahead. I believe that this is something that humanity had to go through and I can truly say that the future I'm from is worth the struggle ahead. Even if our efforts here lead to a few more thousand people surviving, then it'll be worth it.\n\nIn the next day or so, I will post a full summary of the Great Catastrophe and further explanation into why we can't just tell you the date.... but we will give you other information. \n\nRegards,\n\nCharlie",
