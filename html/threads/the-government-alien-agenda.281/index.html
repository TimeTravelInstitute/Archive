Enjoy what is written below because<br />
millions and millions of people share this exact same sentiment about<br />
government and aliens, and it is the current opinion among researchers and<br />
abductees alike.  Why just recently a well know public abductee who happens<br />
to be a very close friend said:<br />
<br />
1.  The aliens do nothing but lie.<br />
2.  Humankind is nothing more than lab rats to the aliens.<br />
3.  The government is equally as dangerous and hurtful as the aliens.<br />
4.  The US government is paranoid about aliens.<br />
4.  Nothing good will ever come forth from the current situation with aliens<br />
and government.<br />
5.  They are glad they won't be here to see the disastrous ending to the<br />
whole thing.<br />
<br />
And so it goes:<br />
<br />
There's no doubt what so ever that aliens are abusive. There is no doubt<br />
that a faction of the US government with the assistance of the NSA is<br />
working in behalf of these aliens and that they too are also abusers.  There<br />
is no doubt that the government is deliberately covering up their complicity<br />
in order to protect themselves and deceive the citizens of the USA.  There<br />
is no doubt what so ever that this government agency holds itself beyond the<br />
law and has committed crimes against the citizens of the USA, including<br />
invasion of privacy,  mind control, and mind influencing.  There is no doubt<br />
what so ever that this agency has, with malice, covertly and deliberately<br />
ruined the lives, families and financial status of citizens who they<br />
perceive as a threat in exposing their operations.<br />
<br />
Anytime one faction has technological superiority, there is abuse of those<br />
who do not have that technological superiority -- namely the innocent<br />
public.  Give humans any sort of position of power, and they abuse it for<br />
personal gain by abusing those who don't have access to that power.  Abusing<br />
innocent people in the name of scientific discovery is still abuse, and<br />
still wrong.  Taking that to it's lowest common denominator, they're nothing<br />
more than common thieves, cheats and con artists -- albeit it highly<br />
educated, knowledgeable and privileged people, but not worthy of honest<br />
people's respect.  And they're morally wrong.  Period.<br />
<br />
Any person within secret government who is working with or in contact with<br />
aliens is subject to alien manipulation and mind control and have been<br />
manipulated into believing they are doing something nobel for mankind. Any<br />
person within secret government is an abductee, then they've been<br />
conditioned to do their job within secret government via alien mind control<br />
and manipulation and likely suffer Stockholm Syndrome.  It is likely the<br />
aliens have selected certain abductees who can not resist alien mind control<br />
to hold key positions within secret government.  <br />
<br />
The aliens lie.  They promise all sorts of things to people, and of course,<br />
those things never come to pass.  The aliens are capable of reading peoples'<br />
minds and can feed back to that person just what that person wants to hear.<br />
making that person believe the aliens are on their side, when in fact, the<br />
aliens are only interested in *their* agenda.  The aliens need humans for<br />
their purpose, which is to genetically engineer an acceptable species of<br />
'humans' who are telepathic and self-reproducing, as their race is dying.<br />
The aliens believe since the human race is *also* dying, that it is<br />
acceptable to parasitize the human race so they can survive through the use<br />
of the human race as a base species.  The truth is the aliens have little<br />
more than contempt for the human species, they think humankind is stupid and<br />
they will at all costs, keep their presence obscured until they are finished<br />
using the human race for their purposes.  The aliens think of themselves as<br />
an altruistic species, saving what is good of the human race.  The only<br />
problem, is that has been done completely without consent *of* the human<br />
race.  And through this whole process, the aliens have had no compassion,<br />
sympathy, regard or respect for the people they've used as test subjects in<br />
order to save themselves.  The aliens use what they glean from peoples'<br />
minds in order to control them, keep the status quo and preserve the<br />
cover-up.  The aliens play on peoples' dreams, deep desires, egos, sex or<br />
any other ploy to maintain the status quo -- and that status quo is the<br />
alien agenda. Are these aliens the benevolent saviors of mankind?  I think<br />
not.  They never gave anyone a chance, and in stead tell everyone they have<br />
the right to do what they're doing, and they've been 'sanctioned' by a<br />
higher authority, implying they are godly.  The fact is if god exists, it<br />
can not be proven.  But *if* the human race are gods children, then surely<br />
the aliens are tampering where they have *NO* authority.<br />
<br />
The truth is, the human race is nothing more than a resource to the aliens<br />
and the abductees are little more than experimental animals and expendable.<br />
And the government is powerless to do anything about it, because they have<br />
been manipulated into believing they are assisting 'saving' the human race.<br />
<br />
No one alive today will *ever* see the end of this story, because by the<br />
time the aliens have finished their project, we will be dead and gone.<br />
<br />
Kiss the human race goodbye.<br />

Truth Detracting Elements of the  Abduction Phenomena: <br />
<br />
Psychological Implications<br />
<br />
By Eve Frances Lorgen, M. A.<br />
<br />
This is an article taken directly from my book, The Love Bite. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
              One the hallmarks of an abductee is the pattern of emotional<br />
isolation. This behavior  can be explained as a result of conditioning,<br />
learned adaptations from the abductee's family members, or reinforced by the<br />
alien handlers. The abductee usually learns early in life not to talk about<br />
&quot;the little people&quot; who come into their bedrooms at night. The child<br />
may talk about their abduction experiences only to be told that they are<br />
just  &quot;nightmares&quot;. Children often describe the alien intruders as monsters,<br />
who come out of  the closet or through the walls. The children are<br />
immediately invalidated when their  parents or siblings tell them there is<br />
no such thing as monsters, or aliens for that matter. <br />
<br />
              Emotional Isolation and the Maintenance of Secrecy<br />
<br />
              Some abductees have discovered that the aliens instructed them<br />
not talk about their encounters. It is apparent that aliens go to great<br />
lengths to maintain secrecy, instill false  or screen memories into their<br />
victims to cover their true motives. <br />
<br />
              Our social structure--especially in the Western<br />
world--reinforces the precept that  &quot;aliens do not exist&quot; or is only science<br />
fiction. The result of these negating and isolating conditions forces the<br />
abductee to turn inward or act out in rebellion against parents,<br />
school, religion or social structure. The abductee who has been denied<br />
validation of  their experience will have a tendency to not trust their own<br />
feelings, stay in denial and  even act out in anger. Those who have turned<br />
anger inward will become depressed or even suicidal depending on the extent<br />
of trauma endured. <br />
<br />
                                   Post Traumatic Stress<br />
<br />
              Post traumatic stress disorder is common in those who have had<br />
alien encounters  throughout their lives. If a particular event was<br />
extremely traumatic, the characteristic  symptoms will be: intense fear,<br />
terror, helplessness and partial or complete amnesia.  This may include<br />
re-experiencing the abduction, recurrent nightmares, flashbacks, and<br />
avoidance of stimuli associated with the event and an emotional numbing. The<br />
person  may develop insomnia, increased arousal to stimuli (i.e., noises in<br />
the night), fear of the  dark and sleep disorders such as insomnia and night<br />
terrors. In young children, they  may re-experience the trauma through<br />
repetitive play. They may exhibit a marked change in orientation toward the<br />
future, for example, a foreshortened future whereby  they do not expect to<br />
have a long life, career or marriage. The psychic numbing or diminished<br />
responsiveness to stimuli usually begins soon after the traumatic event.<br />
This emotional anesthesia causes the abductee to feel detached and estranged<br />
from other people. <br />
<br />
              Other symptoms for traumatized abductee children are angry<br />
outbursts, rebellious  acting out behaviors and promiscuity. Extreme phobias<br />
of going to the doctor or dentist,  or even preoccupation with horror scenes<br />
(blood and guts) have been reported. <br />
<br />
                       Dissociation and Addictions as Coping Skills<br />
<br />
              At very young ages the abductee is likely to develop<br />
dissociative coping skills if the trauma or abuse was severe. Oftentimes<br />
abuse already occurs in the abductees' family, compounding the issues of<br />
alien abduction. If the parents are in denial of their own alien abductions<br />
and their children's, the abductee has a higher probability of developing<br />
unhealthy coping skills such as, emotional isolation, rebelliousness,<br />
tendency toward violence, drug or alcohol addictions, co-dependency and<br />
early promiscuity. Low self- esteem is a natural by-product of being<br />
invalidated from an early age. <br />
<br />
              Severe forms of personality damage may be later evidenced in<br />
perfectionistic, self-hating, violent, narcissistic tendencies, and<br />
psychopathic or dissociative disorders.   (These do not all appear together<br />
and are exhibited in varying degrees) Egotistical grandiosity is also a<br />
symptom of early trauma that has remained unresolved. This is also<br />
 seen in some mind control victims who have been programmed into being<br />
&quot;super soldiers&quot;. Persons who are extremely sensitive to criticism have been<br />
narcissistically  injured and often display symptoms of grandiosity. <br />
<br />
              One element that is difficult to work with is the alien<br />
mind-control induced amnesia of  the abduction event. The compartmentalized,<br />
dissociated memories of alien encounters  are not necessarily trauma induced<br />
as in other human inflicted trauma. This factor makes treatment difficult<br />
unless the therapist, hypnotist or counselor is experienced in working<br />
with such modalities.<br />
<br />
                         Secret Keeping Behavior in Relationships<br />
<br />
              Unresolved emotional, mental and physical trauma of alien<br />
abductions manifests itself in a myriad of ways. The most common is through<br />
dysfunctional families and relationships.  Dysfunctional can be defined as<br />
any behavior that results in unhealthy relationships.   Secret keeping<br />
behavior and the covert &quot;no talk&quot; rule about alien encounters forces the<br />
abductee to live a false double life. The avoidance of open and honest<br />
communication  and a natural inclination to distrust one's own feelings<br />
thrusts the abductee into  dysfunctional relating patterns. <br />
<br />
              Many abductees have coped quite well considering the forces<br />
against them. I do not want to give the impression that all abductees are in<br />
dysfunctional relationships, but  rather the denial and enforced secrecy of<br />
these issues are the culprit that leads to family problems.<br />
<br />
              Contrary to what one may believe, most abductees have not<br />
undergone hypnosis to recover their memories of alien encounters. Few can<br />
afford professional counseling or hypnosis and even if they can, they<br />
usually avoid it because of the mainstream psychological and medical opinion<br />
of alien abductions. Often going to such  professionals who misdiagnosed<br />
them caused greater damage to the individual. <br />
<br />
                      Co-Dependency Issues and Emotional Isolation<br />
<br />
              One of the most common dysfunctional patterns is<br />
co-dependency. This term was first coined to describe relating patterns of<br />
spouses or close family members of alcoholics,  substance abusers or child<br />
abusers. The main tenet of co- dependent behavior is to avoid feelings and<br />
open and honest communication. This behavior is acted out in ways<br />
that perpetuate the abusers' addiction and maintenance of secrecy. These<br />
behaviors include protecting the addict or abuser from his or her feelings<br />
and avoidance of core issues.<br />
<br />
              Co-dependent persons living with abusers and addicts live<br />
their life as if they were walking on eggshells. They live with a constant<br />
fear or unconscious anxiety not to rock the boat or confront core issues,<br />
which will elicit strong emotions. Very often  co-dependents are people<br />
pleasers who go to great lengths to be friendly and liked by all. The<br />
downside of co-dependent relating is the attraction of unhealthy partners or<br />
 spouses. (This is reported in a majority of abductee relationships.) <br />
<br />
              The unhealthy aspect is the inability and avoidance of being<br />
honest with oneself and  others. This is evident by the direct avoidance of<br />
emotional issues or the tendency to skirt around issues. It is as if they<br />
have blinders over their eyes. Without total honesty, a lack of intimacy<br />
ensues; creating an unfulfilling, empty relationship that perpetuates the<br />
vicious cycle of emotional isolation.<br />
<br />
              This same theme can be addressed to abductees, who enter into<br />
dysfunctional relationships that maintain the secrecy and denial of<br />
abduction issues. The blinders serve  the purpose of maintaining secrecy and<br />
avoidance of the emotional pain of the core abduction issues. The deep and<br />
sometimes dark inner truth of their experience--begging to be heard and<br />
healed.<br />
<br />
                     Multigenerational Abductions and Family Issues<br />
<br />
              Unhealthy coping skills may involve addictions of various<br />
types. Addictions can be the abuse of any substance or repetitive behavior<br />
that serves to keep the person in denial of unresolved psychological and<br />
emotional issues. In this case, avoidance of abduction related trauma, pain,<br />
terror, fear, grief, abandonment and despair of rejection.<br />
<br />
              When alien abduction occurs multigenerationally, dysfunctional<br />
family issues are  compounded. These issues comprise all levels of being;<br />
physical, emotional, mental and  spiritual. All levels must be addressed<br />
before healing and integration can occur. I've  come across professional<br />
psychologists who claim that the majority of post traumatic<br />
stress and dysfunctional family issues in abductees are not from alien<br />
abductions, but from other more &quot;easily explained&quot; psychological theories.<br />
That may be true in part, but  in families where abductions have occurred<br />
for several generations, the denial and  trauma of hidden abductions<br />
compounds--and even creates the dysfunctional behaviors. Resolution and<br />
healing of alien abduction related issues can only be complete when false<br />
and misleading psychological &quot;swamp gas&quot; theories are put to rest and<br />
 hopefully, disproven.<br />
<br />
              In many of Barbara's cases where many hypnotic regressions<br />
were conducted, the therapeutic process of the individual extended into many<br />
years. Sometimes daily phone calls were necessary to keep the client<br />
stabilized during extreme emotional processing.   Aftercare of hypnotic<br />
regressions is necessary for the complete recovery of the  abductee<br />
especially if reality shattering trauma was uncovered.<br />
<br />
                 The Alien Control Factor and The Stockholm Syndrome<br />
<br />
              The main difference between alien abduction trauma and versus<br />
other trauma- based  problems is the added factor of the aliens continued<br />
perpetration of such victimizing activities. Not only do the aliens continue<br />
to contact and abduct the individual, but they also will often act in ways<br />
to prevent the abductee from getting the factual information  they need to<br />
heal from these issues. Often abductees change their attitude concerning<br />
their abductors from anger and helplessness or critical thinking to<br />
adoration and compliance, similar to the &quot;Stockholm&quot; syndrome.<br />
            <br />
              UFO researchers, abduction therapists, psychological and<br />
medical professionals dealing  with abductees often overlook this alien<br />
&quot;control&quot; factor. Core issues of abductees  cannot fully be addressed until<br />
the control factor of the alien presence is acknowledged.  (This includes<br />
acquisition of evidence of alien abductions.) <br />
<br />
                                Health Issues of Abductees<br />
<br />
              Health issues are a frequent complaint of abductees. The most<br />
common medical anomalies are in the area of gynecological and sexual organs,<br />
severe back pain, miscellaneous allergies, skin rashes, autoimmune<br />
disorders, migraines and endocrine  abnormalities. Some abductees are so<br />
affected by their health problems that they are on permanent disability, not<br />
able to work a regular job.<br />
<br />
              I've encountered situations in which the abductee was suddenly<br />
struck ill as a result of  &quot;alien instigated&quot; truth detracting and spiritual<br />
warfare tactics. Unusual health problems  such as panic attacks and anxiety,<br />
heart problems, severe back pain, migraines, nausea  and extreme exhaustion<br />
have resulted from the abductees' efforts to search for the truth  of their<br />
experiences. These blatant health issues and uncoincidental events and<br />
accidents are not simple psychological self-sabotage, but something much<br />
more revealing. The important point here is not the health issues<br />
themselves, but the effects that arise as a result of abductions and &quot;alien<br />
manipulation&quot;. <br />

<br />
ABDUCTEE BRAINWASHING? <br />
by Donna Higbee, CHT <br />
<br />
Attitudes appear to be changing as many abductees who have been traumatized,<br />
physically abused and violated are now<br />
saying that their abductors have only spiritual and/or benevolent motives<br />
behind their actions. This growing new trend is a<br />
concern to a number of researchers and healthcare professionals who work<br />
with abductees. <br />
<br />
Many abductees who once reported tremendous fear of being taken repeatedly<br />
from their bedrooms and cars by non-human<br />
entities are now reporting being told by these entities that it was for<br />
their own good; that their fear was unwarranted and was<br />
simply a product of the abductee's lack of understanding. In many cases,<br />
abductees who accept this explanation are also led<br />
to believe that technological advancement equals spiritual advancement.<br />
There is no logical reasoning for this, as spiritual<br />
advancement may run parallel to technological advancement, the two may not<br />
proceed along together at the same pace, or<br />
they may not run along together at all. We cannot assume that where we find<br />
one we will find the other. <br />
<br />
I believe the reasoning put forth by these abductees to justify abduction is<br />
faulty. I am a hypnotherapist in Santa Barbara,<br />
California, working with abductees. I became personally involved in this<br />
situation when I watched two members of our<br />
support group change their stories from one meeting to the next. These were<br />
abductees who had been terrorized and abused<br />
for years and had only hatred for their abductors. Suddenly, their stories<br />
changed and they both, independently of each other,<br />
began saying that recently they were shown that everything that had been<br />
done to them was for their own good and facilitated<br />
their spiritual growth. <br />
<br />
With regards to this, Dr. Karla Turner, in a paper she presented to the<br />
MUFON 1994 International UFO Symposium, said<br />
the following: &quot;It is odd, however, that such growth seems to come to<br />
abductees only after they are aware of their<br />
experiences. If indeed this growth is produced by the aliens, then it should<br />
have been there long before the abductees were<br />
conscious of their encounters, since in almost every reported case there is<br />
evidence of alien involvement since early<br />
childhood. The psychic increase and growth of perceptive abilities indicate<br />
a different genesis - -- an internal evolution of<br />
consciousness -- stemming from our need to know what is and has been done to<br />
us and what we can do to meet the situation<br />
in a more empowered state. Survivors of great catastrophes such as<br />
hurricanes, earthquakes, and war may be crushed by the<br />
impact of these events ... or they may find a new resilience, rising to the<br />
occasion and reacting with abilities they didn't know<br />
they possessed. <br />
<br />
Given the vast intrusive activities of the abduction scenario, our species<br />
may well feel such a threat or stress that a mutational<br />
or evolutionary leap is occurring today....&quot; If this is indeed the case,<br />
then any spiritual growth is the abductee's own doing at a<br />
deep level of consciousness and is not coming from an abducting entity. <br />
<br />
There can be a number of reasons why an abductee changes his mind. One that<br />
has been put forth a number of times is what<br />
is termed the Stockholm Syndrome, AKA the Hostage Syndrome, where a person<br />
who has been kidnapped or captured<br />
eventually comes to sympathize with and even grow fond of his captors. With<br />
some abductees, I believe that this may be<br />
occurring. However, I think we are seeing something else happening with this<br />
attitude change that goes beyond the easy<br />
answer of the Stockholm Syndrome. <br />
<br />
Because I was disturbed by the attitude change of the abductees I knew and<br />
of many others I had been hearing about, I<br />
wrote a letter in February to a group of abductees who were reachable<br />
through computer online services. I also posted my<br />
letter to a number of bulletin boards on the Internet and asked that<br />
abductees please respond with their thoughts and feelings<br />
about the situation. I'd like to mention a few of the points I made in my<br />
letter and then share with all of you some of the<br />
responses I received from people. <br />
<br />
In my letter, I stated that by the very meaning of the word, abduction<br />
implies being taken against one's will with no say in the<br />
matter. It can include experiencing painful physical procedures, being lied<br />
to and given screen memories, being mentally<br />
terrorized, and being paralyzed, manipulated and controlled. There is<br />
nothing spiritual about any of these things and yet the<br />
abductors say they are highly advanced spiritual beings. It is very<br />
interesting that these non-human entities seem to have<br />
learned two ways to control human beings - through fear and through<br />
acceptance. Obviously we are seeing some abductees<br />
who are still being controlled and manipulated through fear, but we are also<br />
seeing abductees being controlled and<br />
manipulated through their acceptance of these entities as spiritual beings.<br />
By accepting these beings as highly spiritual, the<br />
abductee gives up seeking to end his abduction experiences and instead<br />
starts to welcome them. Instead of abductees<br />
coming into a sense of their own power as spiritual beings who do not need<br />
to give up their free will to anyone, what we are<br />
now seeing is a group of submissive, controlled abductees who are passively<br />
letting the abductors do as they want with them<br />
in the name of spiritual progress. In my opinion, anything that keeps a<br />
person from learning the truth and from taking<br />
responsibility for his own growth and awakening as a spiritual being is<br />
completely unspiritual. Anything that allows the person<br />
his free will, responsibility for his own spiritual progress and aids in the<br />
process of discovering his true unbounded spiritual<br />
nature is truly spiritual. I don't think it is difficult to see into which<br />
category the abductors fall. I believe that we have spiritual<br />
entities in our midst, beings who are assisting humans with their evolution,<br />
but I'm quite sure that these spiritual beings are not<br />
the same as those who are responsible for the abductions. <br />
<br />
In my letter I also stated that the entire hybrid scenario could be a<br />
fantastic cover for an agenda that is completely different<br />
than we are being shown. As Dr. Karla Turner has stated in radio interviews,<br />
it is almost as though abductees are shown the<br />
same movies, as a cover for other motives completely unknown to us, or<br />
possibly they are using the hybrid scenario to study<br />
our emotions. Things should not be taken at face value when we know we are<br />
dealing with entities who can implant thoughts<br />
into our heads, manipulate our minds with screen memories and virtual<br />
reality scenes, and who pass themselves off as<br />
wonderful spiritual beings. We presently have no way to know the truth about<br />
what is really happening. <br />
<br />
I'd like to quote part of a letter I received from an abductee, Irene Rea in<br />
Oregon. She writes, &quot;One of the most frightening<br />
aspects of this phenomenon is the abductor's ability to manipulate the<br />
abductee's perceptions. I'm frightened by the current<br />
trend that many abductees seem to be going through in assigning the<br />
abductors benign motives in the spiritual growth of the<br />
abductees and planetary healing. In my experience, the abductors have<br />
manipulated my reality over and over. In one very<br />
telling instance, my partner and I were abducted together. He thought he was<br />
being wooed by a gorgeous and astoundingly<br />
remarkable woman. My view of his experience was that he was on a table,<br />
strapped to medical gear, and staring into the<br />
eyes of a typical &quot;gray.&quot; I find it even more abusive to be told by my<br />
fellow abductees that the reason I'm experiencing these<br />
negative experiences is because I'm somehow spiritually unadvanced.... <br />
<br />
Another letter from an abductee, Dana Buyers of Los Angeles, California: &quot;We<br />
are nothing more to these beings than a crop<br />
to be harvested. They terrorized me, hurt me and nearly ruined my health. An<br />
abuser is an abuser. I don't care what planet<br />
they come from or how intelligent they claim to be. So when I get the<br />
impulse from them to start thinking that they aren't so<br />
bad after all and are just pursuing some noble purpose that we can't<br />
understand, I show them in my mind all that they have<br />
done to me and I say &quot;get real,&quot; there is no way that I'm ever going to<br />
change my mind. These aliens are dangerous, don't<br />
ever believe them.&quot; <br />
<br />
And a letter from abductee Amy Hebert of Carrollton, Texas: &quot;As a<br />
facilitator of an abductee support group, I have<br />
observed abductees' reactions change from deep contempt and anger toward<br />
their abductors to acceptance and complete<br />
surrender. Some abductees express years and years of anger and confusion,<br />
then suddenly announce they don't think the<br />
aliens are really so bad after all and may actually represent some type of<br />
spiritual experience. These reactions seem quite<br />
surprising, considering the levels of anger and humiliation the abductee<br />
expressed only a week before. Could these new<br />
feelings be due to the resolution of the individual's long-term hatred and<br />
resentment toward the abductors? Or, could this be<br />
yet another example of alien manipulation? According to Dr. Karla Turner,<br />
aliens have been known to lie to abductees for<br />
their own purposes and all abductions take place in an alien-controlled<br />
environment. These alien-human hate-love<br />
relationships seem to reflect alien control more than any spiritually<br />
fulfilling promise for humankind. After all, kidnapping and<br />
forcing someone to be a guinea pig can hardly be considered spiritual.&quot; <br />
<br />
I want to give one last letter I received from a man who is in training as a<br />
body-centered psychotherapist, Mark Richards of<br />
Boston, Massachusetts. He writes, &quot;It's of little doubt that the internal<br />
confusion and pain resulting from one or more<br />
abduction experiences results in some form of compensation. Just as 'screen<br />
memory' tends to re-shape the horrific<br />
experience into more palatable images, it's possible that this same<br />
re-shaping occurs at many other levels, notwithstanding the<br />
body's cellular memory. Given the infinite variety and creativity of the<br />
whole mind, how is it that hypnotic recollections of the<br />
victims, often including deeply felt sensory experiences, have such striking<br />
parallels? Could it be that a 'cult' of some type is<br />
forming and having influence upon the story? ... Culture and historical<br />
factors may strongly influence what comes forth. Here<br />
in our technological, educated and motive culture, when something doesn't<br />
make sense in our head, we switch to 'faith,' to a<br />
spirituality of some sort. Once this switch occurs, we have a 'cult,' and in<br />
the case of abductees as a group, a 'cult'-ure built<br />
around technological unknowns. Perhaps all semblance of reason is not lost,<br />
just put on hold for a while as the body<br />
(collective and individual) tries to make some sense out of stuff that<br />
cannot possibly find correlation. This trend among the<br />
abductee community has not been so named, perhaps out of the same denial<br />
which seems to be increasingly prevalent in the<br />
various stories .. stories that have begun to shift in character and<br />
substance. Now abduction is no longer a horrible violation<br />
but a necessary component of a great plan. Now the aliens who are beaming<br />
into our bedrooms are no longer uninvited<br />
violators of the human story, but welcome harbingers of our 'salvation.' The<br />
parallels between various religious mythological<br />
systems and the growing abductee community are striking. They spring from<br />
the same set of unknowns, growing in the fertile<br />
ground of fear and imagination, a set of ideas concerning the history,<br />
purpose and future of the human race.&quot; <br />

Also read_The Threat_ by David Jacobs.<br />
<br />
Does *any* of this sound like the aliens have humankind's best interests at<br />
heart?  The aliens are here for their own self-interest, and likely need<br />
something from humankind in order to save themselves -- and without any<br />
regard, respect, compassion or consideration to humankind or their well<br />
being whatsoever.  If the aliens were here to help mankind, then why abduct<br />
and abuse people and insist on complete secrecy for their abuse?  They<br />
surely  know they're hurting people, but the aliens simply *don't care*.  <br />
<br />
And thank you, Dr. Jacobs, Bud Hopkins and others.  You're right, and have<br />
been right all along.<br />

Something wicked and evil this way has come.</div>

Hi cat,<br />
<br />
Maybe the aliens themselves are a screen memory put up by a form of mental parasite.<br />
<br />
The aliens appear to be but an updated version of 'demons' who have plauged mankind for all recorded history.<br />
<br />
As for the trama connection, just like a physical injury lets in germs &amp; worms, mental injuries let in the alien-parasite-demon. But hey its all just theory, right?</div>

		"headline": "The Government Alien Agenda",
		"articleBody": "gorby (oyi@udhj.cmj)\n\n\nEnjoy what is written below because\nmillions and millions of people share this exact same sentiment about\ngovernment and aliens, and it is the current opinion among researchers and\nabductees alike.  Why just recently a well know public abductee who happens\nto be a very close friend said:\n\n1.  The aliens do nothing but lie.\n2.  Humankind is nothing more than lab rats to the aliens.\n3.  The government is equally as dangerous and hurtful as the aliens.\n4.  The US government is paranoid about aliens.\n4.  Nothing good will ever come forth from the current situation with aliens\nand government.\n5.  They are glad they won't be here to see the disastrous ending to the\nwhole thing.\n\nAnd so it goes:\n\nThere's no doubt what so ever that aliens are abusive. There is no doubt\nthat a faction of the US government with the assistance of the NSA is\nworking in behalf of these aliens and that they too are also abusers.  There\nis no doubt that the government is deliberately covering up their complicity\nin order to protect themselves and deceive the citizens of the USA.  There\nis no doubt what so ever that this government agency holds itself beyond the\nlaw and has committed crimes against the citizens of the USA, including\ninvasion of privacy,  mind control, and mind influencing.  There is no doubt\nwhat so ever that this agency has, with malice, covertly and deliberately\nruined the lives, families and financial status of citizens who they\nperceive as a threat in exposing their operations.\n\nAnytime one faction has technological superiority, there is abuse of those\nwho do not have that technological superiority -- namely the innocent\npublic.  Give humans any sort of position of power, and they abuse it for\npersonal gain by abusing those who don't have access to that power.  Abusing\ninnocent people in the name of scientific discovery is still abuse, and\nstill wrong.  Taking that to it's lowest common denominator, they're nothing\nmore than common thieves, cheats and con artists -- albeit it highly\neducated, knowledgeable and privileged people, but not worthy of honest\npeople's respect.  And they're morally wrong.  Period.\n\nAny person within secret government who is working with or in contact with\naliens is subject to alien manipulation and mind control and have been\nmanipulated into believing they are doing something nobel for mankind. Any\nperson within secret government is an abductee, then they've been\nconditioned to do their job within secret government via alien mind control\nand manipulation and likely suffer Stockholm Syndrome.  It is likely the\naliens have selected certain abductees who can not resist alien mind control\nto hold key positions within secret government.  \n\nThe aliens lie.  They promise all sorts of things to people, and of course,\nthose things never come to pass.  The aliens are capable of reading peoples'\nminds and can feed back to that person just what that person wants to hear.\nmaking that person believe the aliens are on their side, when in fact, the\naliens are only interested in *their* agenda.  The aliens need humans for\ntheir purpose, which is to genetically engineer an acceptable species of\n'humans' who are telepathic and self-reproducing, as their race is dying.\nThe aliens believe since the human race is *also* dying, that it is\nacceptable to parasitize the human race so they can survive through the use\nof the human race as a base species.  The truth is the aliens have little\nmore than contempt for the human species, they think humankind is stupid and\nthey will at all costs, keep their presence obscured until they are finished\nusing the human race for their purposes.  The aliens think of themselves as\nan altruistic species, saving what is good of the human race.  The only\nproblem, is that has been done completely without consent *of* the human\nrace.  And through this whole process, the aliens have had no compassion,\nsympathy, regard or respect for the people they've used as test subjects in\norder to save themselves.  The aliens use what they glean from peoples'\nminds in order to control them, keep the status quo and preserve the\ncover-up.  The aliens play on peoples' dreams, deep desires, egos, sex or\nany other ploy to maintain the status quo -- and that status quo is the\nalien agenda. Are these aliens the benevolent saviors of mankind?  I think\nnot.  They never gave anyone a chance, and in stead tell everyone they have\nthe right to do what they're doing, and they've been 'sanctioned' by a\nhigher authority, implying they are godly.  The fact is if god exists, it\ncan not be proven.  But *if* the human race are gods children, then surely\nthe aliens are tampering where they have *NO* authority.\n\nThe truth is, the human race is nothing more than a resource to the aliens\nand the abductees are little more than experimental animals and expendable.\nAnd the government is powerless to do anything about it, because they have\nbeen manipulated into believing they are assisting 'saving' the human race.\n\nNo one alive today will *ever* see the end of this story, because by the\ntime the aliens have finished their project, we will be dead and gone.\n\nKiss the human race goodbye.\n\nTruth Detracting Elements of the  Abduction Phenomena: \n\nPsychological Implications\n\nBy Eve Frances Lorgen, M. A.\n\nThis is an article taken directly from my book, The Love Bite. \n\n\n\n              One the hallmarks of an abductee is the pattern of emotional\nisolation. This behavior  can be explained as a result of conditioning,\nlearned adaptations from the abductee's family members, or reinforced by the\nalien handlers. The abductee usually learns early in life not to talk about\n\"the little people\" who come into their bedrooms at night. The child\nmay talk about their abduction experiences only to be told that they are\njust  \"nightmares\". Children often describe the alien intruders as monsters,\nwho come out of  the closet or through the walls. The children are\nimmediately invalidated when their  parents or siblings tell them there is\nno such thing as monsters, or aliens for that matter. \n\n              Emotional Isolation and the Maintenance of Secrecy\n\n              Some abductees have discovered that the aliens instructed them\nnot talk about their encounters. It is apparent that aliens go to great\nlengths to maintain secrecy, instill false  or screen memories into their\nvictims to cover their true motives. \n\n              Our social structure--especially in the Western\nworld--reinforces the precept that  \"aliens do not exist\" or is only science\nfiction. The result of these negating and isolating conditions forces the\nabductee to turn inward or act out in rebellion against parents,\nschool, religion or social structure. The abductee who has been denied\nvalidation of  their experience will have a tendency to not trust their own\nfeelings, stay in denial and  even act out in anger. Those who have turned\nanger inward will become depressed or even suicidal depending on the extent\nof trauma endured. \n\n                                   Post Traumatic Stress\n\n              Post traumatic stress disorder is common in those who have had\nalien encounters  throughout their lives. If a particular event was\nextremely traumatic, the characteristic  symptoms will be: intense fear,\nterror, helplessness and partial or complete amnesia.  This may include\nre-experiencing the abduction, recurrent nightmares, flashbacks, and\navoidance of stimuli associated with the event and an emotional numbing. The\nperson  may develop insomnia, increased arousal to stimuli (i.e., noises in\nthe night), fear of the  dark and sleep disorders such as insomnia and night\nterrors. In young children, they  may re-experience the trauma through\nrepetitive play. They may exhibit a marked change in orientation toward the\nfuture, for example, a foreshortened future whereby  they do not expect to\nhave a long life, career or marriage. The psychic numbing or diminished\nresponsiveness to stimuli usually begins soon after the traumatic event.\nThis emotional anesthesia causes the abductee to feel detached and estranged\nfrom other people. \n\n              Other symptoms for traumatized abductee children are angry\noutbursts, rebellious  acting out behaviors and promiscuity. Extreme phobias\nof going to the doctor or dentist,  or even preoccupation with horror scenes\n(blood and guts) have been reported. \n\n                       Dissociation and Addictions as Coping Skills\n\n              At very young ages the abductee is likely to develop\ndissociative coping skills if the trauma or abuse was severe. Oftentimes\nabuse already occurs in the abductees' family, compounding the issues of\nalien abduction. If the parents are in denial of their own alien abductions\nand their children's, the abductee has a higher probability of developing\nunhealthy coping skills such as, emotional isolation, rebelliousness,\ntendency toward violence, drug or alcohol addictions, co-dependency and\nearly promiscuity. Low self- esteem is a natural by-product of being\ninvalidated from an early age. \n\n              Severe forms of personality damage may be later evidenced in\nperfectionistic, self-hating, violent, narcissistic tendencies, and\npsychopathic or dissociative disorders.   (These do not all appear together\nand are exhibited in varying degrees) Egotistical grandiosity is also a\nsymptom of early trauma that has remained unresolved. This is also\n seen in some mind control victims who have been programmed into being\n\"super soldiers\". Persons who are extremely sensitive to criticism have been\nnarcissistically  injured and often display symptoms of grandiosity. \n\n              One element that is difficult to work with is the alien\nmind-control induced amnesia of  the abduction event. The compartmentalized,\ndissociated memories of alien encounters  are not necessarily trauma induced\nas in other human inflicted trauma. This factor makes treatment difficult\nunless the therapist, hypnotist or counselor is experienced in working\nwith such modalities.\n\n                         Secret Keeping Behavior in Relationships\n\n              Unresolved emotional, mental and physical trauma of alien\nabductions manifests itself in a myriad of ways. The most common is through\ndysfunctional families and relationships.  Dysfunctional can be defined as\nany behavior that results in unhealthy relationships.   Secret keeping\nbehavior and the covert \"no talk\" rule about alien encounters forces the\nabductee to live a false double life. The avoidance of open and honest\ncommunication  and a natural inclination to distrust one's own feelings\nthrusts the abductee into  dysfunctional relating patterns. \n\n              Many abductees have coped quite well considering the forces\nagainst them. I do not want to give the impression that all abductees are in\ndysfunctional relationships, but  rather the denial and enforced secrecy of\nthese issues are the culprit that leads to family problems.\n\n              Contrary to what one may believe, most abductees have not\nundergone hypnosis to recover their memories of alien encounters. Few can\nafford professional counseling or hypnosis and even if they can, they\nusually avoid it because of the mainstream psychological and medical opinion\nof alien abductions. Often going to such  professionals who misdiagnosed\nthem caused greater damage to the individual. \n\n                      Co-Dependency Issues and Emotional Isolation\n\n              One of the most common dysfunctional patterns is\nco-dependency. This term was first coined to describe relating patterns of\nspouses or close family members of alcoholics,  substance abusers or child\nabusers. The main tenet of co- dependent behavior is to avoid feelings and\nopen and honest communication. This behavior is acted out in ways\nthat perpetuate the abusers' addiction and maintenance of secrecy. These\nbehaviors include protecting the addict or abuser from his or her feelings\nand avoidance of core issues.\n\n              Co-dependent persons living with abusers and addicts live\ntheir life as if they were walking on eggshells. They live with a constant\nfear or unconscious anxiety not to rock the boat or confront core issues,\nwhich will elicit strong emotions. Very often  co-dependents are people\npleasers who go to great lengths to be friendly and liked by all. The\ndownside of co-dependent relating is the attraction of unhealthy partners or\n spouses. (This is reported in a majority of abductee relationships.) \n\n              The unhealthy aspect is the inability and avoidance of being\nhonest with oneself and  others. This is evident by the direct avoidance of\nemotional issues or the tendency to skirt around issues. It is as if they\nhave blinders over their eyes. Without total honesty, a lack of intimacy\nensues; creating an unfulfilling, empty relationship that perpetuates the\nvicious cycle of emotional isolation.\n\n              This same theme can be addressed to abductees, who enter into\ndysfunctional relationships that maintain the secrecy and denial of\nabduction issues. The blinders serve  the purpose of maintaining secrecy and\navoidance of the emotional pain of the core abduction issues. The deep and\nsometimes dark inner truth of their experience--begging to be heard and\nhealed.\n\n                     Multigenerational Abductions and Family Issues\n\n              Unhealthy coping skills may involve addictions of various\ntypes. Addictions can be the abuse of any substance or repetitive behavior\nthat serves to keep the person in denial of unresolved psychological and\nemotional issues. In this case, avoidance of abduction related trauma, pain,\nterror, fear, grief, abandonment and despair of rejection.\n\n              When alien abduction occurs multigenerationally, dysfunctional\nfamily issues are  compounded. These issues comprise all levels of being;\nphysical, emotional, mental and  spiritual. All levels must be addressed\nbefore healing and integration can occur. I've  come across professional\npsychologists who claim that the majority of post traumatic\nstress and dysfunctional family issues in abductees are not from alien\nabductions, but from other more \"easily explained\" psychological theories.\nThat may be true in part, but  in families where abductions have occurred\nfor several generations, the denial and  trauma of hidden abductions\ncompounds--and even creates the dysfunctional behaviors. Resolution and\nhealing of alien abduction related issues can only be complete when false\nand misleading psychological \"swamp gas\" theories are put to rest and\n hopefully, disproven.\n\n              In many of Barbara's cases where many hypnotic regressions\nwere conducted, the therapeutic process of the individual extended into many\nyears. Sometimes daily phone calls were necessary to keep the client\nstabilized during extreme emotional processing.   Aftercare of hypnotic\nregressions is necessary for the complete recovery of the  abductee\nespecially if reality shattering trauma was uncovered.\n\n                 The Alien Control Factor and The Stockholm Syndrome\n\n              The main difference between alien abduction trauma and versus\nother trauma- based  problems is the added factor of the aliens continued\nperpetration of such victimizing activities. Not only do the aliens continue\nto contact and abduct the individual, but they also will often act in ways\nto prevent the abductee from getting the factual information  they need to\nheal from these issues. Often abductees change their attitude concerning\ntheir abductors from anger and helplessness or critical thinking to\nadoration and compliance, similar to the \"Stockholm\" syndrome.\n            \n              UFO researchers, abduction therapists, psychological and\nmedical professionals dealing  with abductees often overlook this alien\n\"control\" factor. Core issues of abductees  cannot fully be addressed until\nthe control factor of the alien presence is acknowledged.  (This includes\nacquisition of evidence of alien abductions.) \n\n                                Health Issues of Abductees\n\n              Health issues are a frequent complaint of abductees. The most\ncommon medical anomalies are in the area of gynecological and sexual organs,\nsevere back pain, miscellaneous allergies, skin rashes, autoimmune\ndisorders, migraines and endocrine  abnormalities. Some abductees are so\naffected by their health problems that they are on permanent disability, not\nable to work a regular job.\n\n              I've encountered situations in which the abductee was suddenly\nstruck ill as a result of  \"alien instigated\" truth detracting and spiritual\nwarfare tactics. Unusual health problems  such as panic attacks and anxiety,\nheart problems, severe back pain, migraines, nausea  and extreme exhaustion\nhave resulted from the abductees' efforts to search for the truth  of their\nexperiences. These blatant health issues and uncoincidental events and\naccidents are not simple psychological self-sabotage, but something much\nmore revealing. The important point here is not the health issues\nthemselves, but the effects that arise as a result of abductions and \"alien\nmanipulation\". \n\n© 1998 Eve Frances Lorgen\nhttp:\/\/users1.ee.net\/pmason\/el_implications.html\n\n\n\n\nABDUCTEE BRAINWASHING? \nby Donna Higbee, CHT \n\nAttitudes appear to be changing as many abductees who have been traumatized,\nphysically abused and violated are now\nsaying that their abductors have only spiritual and\/or benevolent motives\nbehind their actions. This growing new trend is a\nconcern to a number of researchers and healthcare professionals who work\nwith abductees. \n\nMany abductees who once reported tremendous fear of being taken repeatedly\nfrom their bedrooms and cars by non-human\nentities are now reporting being told by these entities that it was for\ntheir own good; that their fear was unwarranted and was\nsimply a product of the abductee's lack of understanding. In many cases,\nabductees who accept this explanation are also led\nto believe that technological advancement equals spiritual advancement.\nThere is no logical reasoning for this, as spiritual\nadvancement may run parallel to technological advancement, the two may not\nproceed along together at the same pace, or\nthey may not run along together at all. We cannot assume that where we find\none we will find the other. \n\nI believe the reasoning put forth by these abductees to justify abduction is\nfaulty. I am a hypnotherapist in Santa Barbara,\nCalifornia, working with abductees. I became personally involved in this\nsituation when I watched two members of our\nsupport group change their stories from one meeting to the next. These were\nabductees who had been terrorized and abused\nfor years and had only hatred for their abductors. Suddenly, their stories\nchanged and they both, independently of each other,\nbegan saying that recently they were shown that everything that had been\ndone to them was for their own good and facilitated\ntheir spiritual growth. \n\nWith regards to this, Dr. Karla Turner, in a paper she presented to the\nMUFON 1994 International UFO Symposium, said\nthe following: \"It is odd, however, that such growth seems to come to\nabductees only after they are aware of their\nexperiences. If indeed this growth is produced by the aliens, then it should\nhave been there long before the abductees were\nconscious of their encounters, since in almost every reported case there is\nevidence of alien involvement since early\nchildhood. The psychic increase and growth of perceptive abilities indicate\na different genesis - -- an internal evolution of\nconsciousness -- stemming from our need to know what is and has been done to\nus and what we can do to meet the situation\nin a more empowered state. Survivors of great catastrophes such as\nhurricanes, earthquakes, and war may be crushed by the\nimpact of these events ... or they may find a new resilience, rising to the\noccasion and reacting with abilities they didn't know\nthey possessed. \n\nGiven the vast intrusive activities of the abduction scenario, our species\nmay well feel such a threat or stress that a mutational\nor evolutionary leap is occurring today....\" If this is indeed the case,\nthen any spiritual growth is the abductee's own doing at a\ndeep level of consciousness and is not coming from an abducting entity. \n\nThere can be a number of reasons why an abductee changes his mind. One that\nhas been put forth a number of times is what\nis termed the Stockholm Syndrome, AKA the Hostage Syndrome, where a person\nwho has been kidnapped or captured\neventually comes to sympathize with and even grow fond of his captors. With\nsome abductees, I believe that this may be\noccurring. However, I think we are seeing something else happening with this\nattitude change that goes beyond the easy\nanswer of the Stockholm Syndrome. \n\nBecause I was disturbed by the attitude change of the abductees I knew and\nof many others I had been hearing about, I\nwrote a letter in February to a group of abductees who were reachable\nthrough computer online services. I also posted my\nletter to a number of bulletin boards on the Internet and asked that\nabductees please respond with their thoughts and feelings\nabout the situation. I'd like to mention a few of the points I made in my\nletter and then share with all of you some of the\nresponses I received from people. \n\nIn my letter, I stated that by the very meaning of the word, abduction\nimplies being taken against one's will with no say in the\nmatter. It can include experiencing painful physical procedures, being lied\nto and given screen memories, being mentally\nterrorized, and being paralyzed, manipulated and controlled. There is\nnothing spiritual about any of these things and yet the\nabductors say they are highly advanced spiritual beings. It is very\ninteresting that these non-human entities seem to have\nlearned two ways to control human beings - through fear and through\nacceptance. Obviously we are seeing some abductees\nwho are still being controlled and manipulated through fear, but we are also\nseeing abductees being controlled and\nmanipulated through their acceptance of these entities as spiritual beings.\nBy accepting these beings as highly spiritual, the\nabductee gives up seeking to end his abduction experiences and instead\nstarts to welcome them. Instead of abductees\ncoming into a sense of their own power as spiritual beings who do not need\nto give up their free will to anyone, what we are\nnow seeing is a group of submissive, controlled abductees who are passively\nletting the abductors do as they want with them\nin the name of spiritual progress. In my opinion, anything that keeps a\nperson from learning the truth and from taking\nresponsibility for his own growth and awakening as a spiritual being is\ncompletely unspiritual. Anything that allows the person\nhis free will, responsibility for his own spiritual progress and aids in the\nprocess of discovering his true unbounded spiritual\nnature is truly spiritual. I don't think it is difficult to see into which\ncategory the abductors fall. I believe that we have spiritual\nentities in our midst, beings who are assisting humans with their evolution,\nbut I'm quite sure that these spiritual beings are not\nthe same as those who are responsible for the abductions. \n\nIn my letter I also stated that the entire hybrid scenario could be a\nfantastic cover for an agenda that is completely different\nthan we are being shown. As Dr. Karla Turner has stated in radio interviews,\nit is almost as though abductees are shown the\nsame movies, as a cover for other motives completely unknown to us, or\npossibly they are using the hybrid scenario to study\nour emotions. Things should not be taken at face value when we know we are\ndealing with entities who can implant thoughts\ninto our heads, manipulate our minds with screen memories and virtual\nreality scenes, and who pass themselves off as\nwonderful spiritual beings. We presently have no way to know the truth about\nwhat is really happening. \n\nI'd like to quote part of a letter I received from an abductee, Irene Rea in\nOregon. She writes, \"One of the most frightening\naspects of this phenomenon is the abductor's ability to manipulate the\nabductee's perceptions. I'm frightened by the current\ntrend that many abductees seem to be going through in assigning the\nabductors benign motives in the spiritual growth of the\nabductees and planetary healing. In my experience, the abductors have\nmanipulated my reality over and over. In one very\ntelling instance, my partner and I were abducted together. He thought he was\nbeing wooed by a gorgeous and astoundingly\nremarkable woman. My view of his experience was that he was on a table,\nstrapped to medical gear, and staring into the\neyes of a typical \"gray.\" I find it even more abusive to be told by my\nfellow abductees that the reason I'm experiencing these\nnegative experiences is because I'm somehow spiritually unadvanced.... \n\nAnother letter from an abductee, Dana Buyers of Los Angeles, California: \"We\nare nothing more to these beings than a crop\nto be harvested. They terrorized me, hurt me and nearly ruined my health. An\nabuser is an abuser. I don't care what planet\nthey come from or how intelligent they claim to be. So when I get the\nimpulse from them to start thinking that they aren't so\nbad after all and are just pursuing some noble purpose that we can't\nunderstand, I show them in my mind all that they have\ndone to me and I say \"get real,\" there is no way that I'm ever going to\nchange my mind. These aliens are dangerous, don't\never believe them.\" \n\nAnd a letter from abductee Amy Hebert of Carrollton, Texas: \"As a\nfacilitator of an abductee support group, I have\nobserved abductees' reactions change from deep contempt and anger toward\ntheir abductors to acceptance and complete\nsurrender. Some abductees express years and years of anger and confusion,\nthen suddenly announce they don't think the\naliens are really so bad after all and may actually represent some type of\nspiritual experience. These reactions seem quite\nsurprising, considering the levels of anger and humiliation the abductee\nexpressed only a week before. Could these new\nfeelings be due to the resolution of the individual's long-term hatred and\nresentment toward the abductors? Or, could this be\nyet another example of alien manipulation? According to Dr. Karla Turner,\naliens have been known to lie to abductees for\ntheir own purposes and all abductions take place in an alien-controlled\nenvironment. These alien-human hate-love\nrelationships seem to reflect alien control more than any spiritually\nfulfilling promise for humankind. After all, kidnapping and\nforcing someone to be a guinea pig can hardly be considered spiritual.\" \n\nI want to give one last letter I received from a man who is in training as a\nbody-centered psychotherapist, Mark Richards of\nBoston, Massachusetts. He writes, \"It's of little doubt that the internal\nconfusion and pain resulting from one or more\nabduction experiences results in some form of compensation. Just as 'screen\nmemory' tends to re-shape the horrific\nexperience into more palatable images, it's possible that this same\nre-shaping occurs at many other levels, notwithstanding the\nbody's cellular memory. Given the infinite variety and creativity of the\nwhole mind, how is it that hypnotic recollections of the\nvictims, often including deeply felt sensory experiences, have such striking\nparallels? Could it be that a 'cult' of some type is\nforming and having influence upon the story? ... Culture and historical\nfactors may strongly influence what comes forth. Here\nin our technological, educated and motive culture, when something doesn't\nmake sense in our head, we switch to 'faith,' to a\nspirituality of some sort. Once this switch occurs, we have a 'cult,' and in\nthe case of abductees as a group, a 'cult'-ure built\naround technological unknowns. Perhaps all semblance of reason is not lost,\njust put on hold for a while as the body\n(collective and individual) tries to make some sense out of stuff that\ncannot possibly find correlation. This trend among the\nabductee community has not been so named, perhaps out of the same denial\nwhich seems to be increasingly prevalent in the\nvarious stories .. stories that have begun to shift in character and\nsubstance. Now abduction is no longer a horrible violation\nbut a necessary component of a great plan. Now the aliens who are beaming\ninto our bedrooms are no longer uninvited\nviolators of the human story, but welcome harbingers of our 'salvation.' The\nparallels between various religious mythological\nsystems and the growing abductee community are striking. They spring from\nthe same set of unknowns, growing in the fertile\nground of fear and imagination, a set of ideas concerning the history,\npurpose and future of the human race.\" \n\nhttp:\/\/www.visitations.com\/ufofiles\/abductions\/abduction3.htm\n\nAlso read_The Threat_ by David Jacobs.\n\nDoes *any* of this sound like the aliens have humankind's best interests at\nheart?  The aliens are here for their own self-interest, and likely need\nsomething from humankind in order to save themselves -- and without any\nregard, respect, compassion or consideration to humankind or their well\nbeing whatsoever.  If the aliens were here to help mankind, then why abduct\nand abuse people and insist on complete secrecy for their abuse?  They\nsurely  know they're hurting people, but the aliens simply *don't care*.  \n\nAnd thank you, Dr. Jacobs, Bud Hopkins and others.  You're right, and have\nbeen right all along.\n\nSomething wicked and evil this way has come.",
