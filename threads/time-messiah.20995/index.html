EXT.  --  THIRD DISTRICT, WASHINGTON D.C., ARIEL VIEW  --  DAY<br />
<br />
2056 A. D.  Washington, D.C. rebuilding after the devastating war and Holocaust.  The area, looking more like a pristine rural part of the new country than a city, a remnant of survivors are hard at work building a new White House, a new Capitol buildingâ€”a new Washington.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL HEADQUARTERS<br />
<br />
RAYNE SOMMERS labors in the new offices of the President of the Third District--his brother, OLIVER SOMMERS.  Rayne is a tall dark, sullen-looking man, age 56.  A YOUNG MAN, one of the AIDES, walks through the door with prototypes of posters to show Sommers.  He is running for the president of the Fourth District, located in the Midwest.  As he looks them over, he finds the one he likes best.  The lad leaves.  Rayne turns to some old picture frames housing some old world news clippings he's about to hang on the walls, headlines they never want see again: WORLD GONE MAD; WORLD WAR III BEGINS; and one he does about his ACCELERON CORP.:  ACCELERON BREAKS TIME BARRIER.  He lingers over that one for a moment. And then there is the one about his father, TRENTON SOMMERS, ASSASSINATED at the presidential forum he attended long ago.  It is coupled with a follow-up headline:  PRESIDENT MARS CAHILL REMAINS IN CRITICAL CONDITION.  Rayne thinks on that time for a moment, and how he loathed his father, as his brother, OLIVER, prances in, wiping the sweat from his brow from a hard day's work.  He is all smiles and still looking quite refreshed, excited, about his future new role.  Oliver is handsome, 49, looks very much like his deceased fatherâ€”unlike Rayne--which makes Rayne loathe his father all the moreâ€”not to mention his brother.<br />
<br />
			OLIVER<br />
<br />
          I'd thought you'd have the office finished by now.<br />
<br />
          (sadly lingers over clippings)  That was<br />
<br />
          a long time ago.<br />
<br />
			RAYNE<br />
<br />
	   We were just boys then.<br />
<br />
		        OLIVER<br />
<br />
          And living miles apart.  You were what,<br />
<br />
          twelve, then?  I was only seven.<br />
<br />
		        RAYNE<br />
<br />
	  You were the lucky oneâ€”living away from that<br />
<br />
          monster of a father.<br />
<br />
			OLIVER<br />
<br />
	   If Pop had had his way, though.<br />
<br />
			RAYNE<br />
<br />
	  You were too young and Mother too vulnerable.<br />
<br />
			OLIVER<br />
<br />
	  May God rest both their souls.<br />
<br />
		        RAYNE<br />
<br />
          May he burn in hell, that son-of-a-bitch.<br />
<br />
		        OLIVER<br />
<br />
          Let it rest, Rayne.<br />
<br />
		        RAYNE<br />
<br />
          He never laid a hand on you.  You were safe<br />
<br />
          with Motherâ€”in California.<br />
<br />
			OLIVER<br />
<br />
          No.  You're right.  He didn't.   But he's gone<br />
<br />
          Now, and I promise you this world-our world's going<br />
<br />
          to beâ€”betterâ€”for all of us.  You'll see.  Now that<br />
<br />
          I'm president of the Washington district.<br />
<br />
			RAYNE<br />
<br />
	  Do you honestly think five districts run by five presidents<br />
<br />
          will help our country to grow strong again, like it once was?<br />
<br />
                        OLIVER<br />
<br />
          Always the skeptic. Did Father teach you to be<br />
<br />
          so cynical?--Oh, by the way, before I forget.<br />
<br />
          A Doctor Ed Saunders called.  Something about opening up a<br />
<br />
          portion of the Acceleron laboratories again and needing an<br />
<br />
          old style nineteen seventy's computer the company manufactured<br />
<br />
          when it was still a part of IBM. I told him you'd get back to<br />
<br />
          him sometime this afternoon.  After all, you are the CEO of<br />
<br />
         the company.  You still are CEO, aren't you?<br />
<br />
			RAYNE<br />
<br />
          Not for long, I hope.<br />
<br />
			OLIVER<br />
<br />
          Oh, and that Prescott friend of yours.  Some-<br />
<br />
          thing about your promising him a job after the elections.<br />
<br />
          I told him, we didn't have any openings at the moment and<br />
<br />
          I didn't think we were going to have any anytime soon.  I<br />
<br />
          promised my constituents this was going to be a new, leaner<br />
<br />
          â€”meaner government machineâ€”run like the true democracies in<br />
<br />
          ancient times.  But we still have to take care of the little<br />
<br />
          people.  Maybe you have an opening at Acceleron?<br />
<br />
			RAYNE<br />
<br />
          I told him he could help me with my campaign<br />
<br />
          for the Midwest District presidency.<br />
<br />
			OLIVER<br />
<br />
          Come on.   Be realistic, Rayne.  Do you really think you can<br />
<br />
          beat Senator Marion Brooks for that office?<br />
<br />
Oliver has struck and sour chord with his brother.  Rayne's temper is beginning to rise deep inside him. Oliver is just like their father was toward Rayneâ€”a bully.<br />
<br />
			OLIVER<br />
<br />
           Since our time together I've learned Dad was right about one<br />
<br />
           thingâ€”you're just not presidential material.  You can't even<br />
<br />
           finish the job I've assigned you on time.  How do you<br />
<br />
           think you're going to run the midwestern district<br />
<br />
           by yourself?--A president's gotta have an office.  (exiting)<br />
<br />
           Don't forget to call Saunders.<br />
<br />
As soon as Oliver is out of sight, Rayne takes his cell phone out of his pocket, dials.<br />
<br />
			RAYNE<br />
<br />
           Hayden.  How soon can you meet me?  I've just been given<br />
<br />
           confirmationâ€”by my own brother--I've been dumped as his<br />
<br />
           candidate of choice for third district presidency.  That<br />
<br />
           means our little project's a go.--No, they still don't<br />
<br />
           know we have the machineâ€”and they won't if you don't tell<br />
<br />
           them.--I'm ready now.  I'll be there in a few<br />
<br />
           minutes.  Wait for me.  I just have one more phone call to<br />
<br />
           make.<br />
<br />
Rayne dials his cell phone again.<br />
<br />
			RAYNE<br />
<br />
           You just wait, little brother.  By this time tomorrow,<br />
<br />
           you'll be the one who is gone, dead, buried in time forever,<br />
<br />
           and I'll be the sole ruler of this--new world.  And then<br />
<br />
           we'll see just who is presidential material.  You are SO<br />
<br />
           like that monster who dared to call himself our father.<br />
<br />
           (leaves as he talks on the phone)  Dr. Saunders . . . .I'm<br />
<br />
           glad I caught you.<br />

INT.  --  THE OLD ACCELERON BUILDING NOW THE DE HAVILAND MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND COMPUTER TECHNOLOGIES  --  NIGHT<br />
<br />
2012 A. D.  CHARLES MARTEL, a TIME TRAVELER from the year 2056 A. D., has just broken into the museum and is now in the process of looking for an old-style, 1970's 5100 word processing computer.  It is needed back in his time, 2056 A. D., to read and translate the older codes to program into their computers.  Charles is about 49-50, smart, savvy, quite handsome, a vigorous man. He is part of the remnant who've survived the war and holocaust and are now in the process of rebuilding.  He works for the company called ACCELERON ELECTRONICS AND SEMI-CONDUCTORS, CORP., the company that discovered time travel.  The museum is dark, almost deserted, except for a few security guards patrolling.  He's brought a gun with him, just in case.  A voice on his communicator keeps repeating:<br />
<br />
	               VOICE ON COMMUNICATOR<br />
<br />
           Charlie.  Are you in?<br />
<br />
INT.  --  ACCELERON CORP. OFFICE  --  DAY<br />
<br />
DR. ED SAUNDERS, Charles' partner, friend and co-adventurer in their little undertaking for ACCELERON, guides Charles to his destination and prize.  He is much older, in his 60's, a white-collar, conservative, family-oriented kind of guy, a very squeaky clean, nerdy-looking neatnik.  Two men in the background, one very large, clean-shaven, THOMAS, the smaller, GEORGE, looking like a rumpled hippie left over from the 60's, are both also in their sixties.  They monitor the machines as Charles remains in the past. George is at a TV screen, also keeping watch on a broadcast in progress:  a news report from WSGT-TV news anchor ROSS KENYON.  The anchor is an older, silver-haired, respected man in their time period, also in his sixties.  A photo of RAYNE SOMMERS is projected along side Ross as he reports, the man is apparently missing.<br />

<br />
	In the news tonight, philanthropist and<br />
<br />
        head of the Acceleron Corporationâ€”Rayne<br />
<br />
        Sommers is missing.  Sommers, son and only<br />
<br />
        child of the late, once-Vice-president of<br />
<br />
        the United States, Trenton Sommers . . .<br />
<br />
As Ross's words fade into the background . . .<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
	(to Thomas)  Wait a minute.  Didn't Sommers<br />
<br />
	have a younger brother named Orlando?<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
	I think the name was Oliver.<br />
<br />
			ROSS ON SCREEN<br />
<br />
        . . . who was known for his work in cyber-electronics as<br />
<br />
       well as space exploration has vanished.  No one seems to<br />
<br />
       know . . .<br />
<br />
EMILY, Ed's daughter, comes over to take a quick look, herself, at George's monitors.  She sees nothing wrong, but George and Thomas do.  Emily is a dark haired, comely woman, age 44.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	How's everything else looking?<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
	(feigning smile, thumbs up)  Still on target.<br />
<br />
	It's just that one anomaly.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	If that's all that changes . . .<br />
<br />
Emily leaves, heads toward her father.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
	(unhappy with George)  You couldn't tell her?<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
Ed, still on the communicator with Charles.  He has a newspaper spread out over the top of his desk.  Headlines skirting Rayne's picture:  HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN? FORMER PRESIDENT AND CEO OF ACCELERON. DR. HAYDEN PRESCOTT WANTED FOR QUESTIONING.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	This wasn't in the test run two weeks ago.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
I know.  I've had a bad feeling about this all day.  Something's not right.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	George didn't say anything else was wrong when<br />
<br />
	I was just over there.<br />
<br />
They see Thomas approach.  The looks on their faces turn stark.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
	We've got problems.  Big ones.  We gotta<br />
<br />
	get Charlie out of there a-s-a-p.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  MUSEUM, 2012 A. D.  --  NIGHT<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Okay, Ed.  I'm in. (checks for more guards)<br />
<br />
	Where do I go now?<br />
<br />
			VOICE ON COMMUNICATOR:  ED<br />
<br />
	It's in the next room.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I see it.  But it's so dark in here, I can<br />
<br />
	hardly see where I'm going.<br />
<br />
IMT.  --  ACCELERON<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT:  EMILY, ED, THOMAS.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
        Something's created a massive fracture in the timeline.<br />
<br />
        If we don't get him out of there now, we may lose him.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  DE HAVILAND<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT, CHARLES.  He hears the conversation on his communicator and worries.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Ed, is anything wrong?<br />
<br />
But no one hears Charles.<br />
<br />
CUT BACK TO:<br />
<br />
INT.  --  ACCELERON<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	Dad.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
	Forget about the disks, Ed. It's now or never.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	(to Thomas) Can you see what created it?<br />
<br />
Thomas shakes his head no.  Ed shouts into the communicator as things begin to change/alter their appearance around them.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	Charlie. We've gotta get you out of there now!<br />
<br />
INT.--  DE HAVILAND<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I'm almost there, Ed.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	How far away are you from the time machine?<br />
<br />
Charles spots the computer.  But there are still a couple of guards in the hallway.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	It's at my mother's.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
Leave the computer, Charlie.  We can try again later.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I'm almost there, Ed.  Just give me a couple<br />
<br />
	more minutes.<br />
<br />
But Charles has to cut the conversation off quickly as more guards pass by, shining their flashlights into the room, allowing Charles to see where the electronic laser beams crisscross so he can finally to get to the computer.  The task isn't easy, but, finally, the coast clears long enough, he gets to the computer, grabs his prize and leaves undetected.<br />
<br />
EXT.  --  DE HAVILAND GROUNDS  --  NIGHT<br />
<br />
	                 CHARLES<br />
<br />
        (into communicator)  I got it.  I'm on my way.  I'll<br />
<br />
        see you soon.<br />
<br />
But there is no answer back, only dead air, as he hurries back to his mother's car and his childhood home totally unaware of the problem back in the future.<br />
<br />
TIME LAPSE.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  CHARLIE'S BEDROOM/MARTEL HOME  --  NIGHT<br />
<br />
The Martel home, 2012.  Charles is in his bedroom working on a computer.  The room is decorated with all sorts of little boy items: action figures, a baseball cap, glove, a ballâ€”along with a few items Charles brought from the futureâ€”a HIGH TECH FLASH DRIVE ENCYCLOPEDIA COLLECTION from the year 2056, a few, well-worn paperback novels, RAIN BEAR by ANDREW CORRIGAN, H.G. WELL'S TIME MACHINE, a BIBLE, an old dog-eared copy of the U. S. CONSTITUTION, as well as a well-loved brown, stuffed teddy bear Charles gave to Charlie.  He surfs the Time Traveler message boards on the Net. As he reads some of the anonymous messages, he thinks about going home again and WHO he's left behind:  ARIEL DU BOIS, a dazzling FRENCH BEAUTY who works for Senator Marion Brooks.<br />
<br />
FLASHBACK:<br />
<br />
INT.  --  ARIEL'S BOUDOIR  --  NIGHT<br />
<br />
Charles and Ariel are in bed together making passionately love and talking about their respective jobs.<br />
<br />
		        CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Ooh, Ariel.  You're so good for me.<br />
<br />
		        ARIEL<br />
<br />
Do you really have to go?  Can't they send somebody else?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Come with me.  There's room enough for two.<br />
<br />
			ARIEL<br />
<br />
Can't.  My boss is announcing her candidacy tomorrow for the fourth district presidency and<br />
<br />
I have to be there to write the press releases,<br />
<br />
take notes, greet people.  You know, the whole political drill.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Maybe next time?<br />
<br />
			ARIEL<br />
<br />
        Absolutely.  In the meantime, let's not waste<br />
<br />
        the rest of tonight talking about it.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I'll drink to that.<br />
<br />
They kiss passionately, make love.<br />
<br />
END FLASHBACK<br />
<br />
Charles is brought back to the 'present' by a question on the message board.<br />
<br />
			ON COMPUTER SCREEN:<br />
<br />
	'When will World War III begin?'<br />
<br />
He's about to reply when a toe-headed little boy, five years of age, plods into the room, dressed in his pajamas, ready for bed.  It's young Charles, AS HE WAS AS A YOUNG BOY.  Young Charles believes the older Charles is his uncle.  He plops onto his bed, grabs the TV remote and begins surfing channels.  But all he can find is a news-breaking story:  PRESIDENT MARS CAHILL being questioned by a very blonde, very beautiful, star reporter, WILHELMINA JONES.  His Vice-Present, TRENTON SOMMERS, stands behind him.<br />
<br />
Another question pops onto the computer screen.<br />
<br />
			ON COMPUTER SCREEN:<br />
<br />
	'Did Jesus return?'<br />
<br />
SOUND ON TV:  an angry crowd rails against the president, waving placards, threatening revolution as they boldly proclaim the opposing candidate: JACKSON STRYKER, as their candidate.<br />
<br />
			YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
	(sighs)  There's nothing on.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
Tough luck, pal.  Next time I come for a visit, I'll see if I can get you some cable.<br />
<br />
			CHARLIE<br />
<br />
	Uncle Charles?  Do you really have to go?<br />
<br />
Young Charlie goes to hug the older Charles.  He climbs onto his lap.   Charles hugs back and kisses him on the forehead.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Yes.  I really have to go. People are waiting<br />
<br />
	for me back home. I can't let them down now,<br />
<br />
	can I?  But I promise. I'll be back, soon.<br />
<br />
	Okay?<br />
<br />
			YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
	I wish you could stay.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I wish I could stay, too, Bud.--But I can't.<br />
<br />
	So . . .let's get you tucked into bed.<br />
<br />
Grabbing his brown teddy bear, Charlie crawls under the covers.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I know how hard it is not having a dad around<br />
<br />
        to do things with. But, hey . . . know what?  Next time<br />
<br />
        I come for a visit I'll take you to that baseball game<br />
<br />
        I promised.  How's that sound?<br />
<br />
			CHARLIE<br />
<br />
	(excited)  Yeah! . . . Goodnight, Uncle<br />
<br />
	Charles.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Goodnight, Charlie.<br />
<br />
Charlie rolls over, closes his eyes.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
         Love you. (peers at young Charlie)  If only I could be<br />
<br />
         you againâ€”in this placeâ€”in this time.<br />
<br />
Charles gathers up the TV remote to turn the TV off.  He stops a moment to watch.  Newscaster Wilhelmina Jones, still in relentless pursuit of a story, has captured Charles's attention.<br />
<br />
EXT.  --  PRESIDENTIAL FORUM  --  NIGHT<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina is at the presidential platform with her cameraman.<br />
<br />
			WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
        President Cahill, with China's recent forced annexation of<br />
<br />
        both Koreas and now with their threat to take over Taiwan,<br />
<br />
        how do you plan on handling this volatile situation in the<br />
<br />
        Far East?<br />
<br />
			CAHILL<br />
<br />
         Of course, we've been pursuing every avenue to get Chairman<br />
<br />
         Yang to relinquish China's claim on Taiwan, while<br />
<br />
         maintaining our current status of friendship between our<br />
<br />
         two countries.<br />
<br />
			WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
        President Cahill.  Rumor has it the Premier of China has,<br />
<br />
        in effect, thrown down the political gauntlet and issued<br />
<br />
        an ultimatum against the United States warning us to back<br />
<br />
        off or face  severe consequences.<br />
<br />
		        CAHILL<br />
<br />
         As I said before, Ms. Jones, we will continue to pursue<br />
<br />
        our policy of peaceful negotiations with the People's<br />
<br />
        Republic of China. But make no mistake, if Chairman Yang<br />
<br />
        wants to start a war with us, I will defend my country to<br />
<br />
        the death.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT.  LARGE, BUSHY HEDGE IN THE DISTANCE.  A GUN BARREL SLOWLY EMERGES FROM ITS DENSE THICKET, AIMED DIRECTLY AT THE PRESIDENT.<br />
<br />
		        ANGRY MOB MEMBER #1<br />
<br />
          War!  Is that all you politicians like to<br />
<br />
          talk about?<br />
<br />
		        WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
         Mr. President . . .<br />
<br />
			ANGRY MOB MEMBER #2<br />
<br />
         What about food, Mr. President?  The people<br />
<br />
        are starving.  We have no food.<br />
<br />
		        ANGRY MOB MEMBER #3<br />
<br />
        Jobs?  What about jobs?  We need work!<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina directs her cameraman, AL, to pan the crowd.<br />
<br />
			WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
	Al, can you get some of this on camera?<br />
<br />
			ANGRY MOB MEMBER#4<br />
<br />
        I have two kids and no place to live.<br />
<br />
		        ANGRY MOB MEMBER #5<br />
<br />
        Don't we count for something, to, Mr.<br />
<br />
        President?<br />
<br />
			CAHILL<br />
<br />
        I assure you.  My administration is doing everything<br />
<br />
        it can . . .<br />
<br />
			ANGRY MOB MEMBER #6<br />
<br />
	Bull!<br />
<br />
			ANGRY MOB MEMBER #7<br />
<br />
        Oil and gas prices are so high only you rich<br />
<br />
        can afford to live here anymore.<br />
<br />
			ANGRY MOB MEMBER #6<br />
<br />
        We're tired of your empty promises.  We want action<br />
<br />
        --now!<br />
<br />
			ANGRY MOB MEMBER # 7<br />
<br />
	Yeah!  We want a man who will really lead us.<br />
<br />
	We want Jackson Stryker!<br />
<br />
			ANGRY MOB MEMBER #8<br />
<br />
        (leading chant)  Yeah, Stryker.  We want<br />
<br />
         Senator Stryker.  Stryker, Stryker.<br />
<br />
As others join in with the chanting, police struggle to hold the crowd back.  As tempers flare, they begin to push toward the platform.  Part of the protestors starts throwing things at President Cahill, Vice-president Sommers.<br />
<br />
			CAHILL<br />
<br />
        (shielding self, trying to step out of the way)<br />
<br />
        Ladies! Gentlemen!<br />
<br />
Chanting grows louder.<br />
<br />
			CAHILL<br />
<br />
        Citizens of this great country.  I assure you<br />
<br />
        I am ready to do whatever it takes . . .<br />
<br />
SOUND:  GUNSHOTS SUDDENLY SILENCE THE CHANTING.  AND THEN, A SHRILL SCREAM.<br />
<br />
Quickly, the crowd begins to scatters as Cahill falls to the ground, he is hit.  SECRET SERVICEMEN swarm in around, to late for the president, to protect the vice-president and other dignitaries still standing on the platform.  A secret serviceman kneels by President Cahill, reaches for his walkie-talkie.<br />
<br />
			SECRET SERVICEMAN #1<br />
<br />
         Sector one to Sector two.  Shots fired.  The president<br />
<br />
         is down.  I repeat.  The president is down.  We need<br />
<br />
         back upâ€”NOW!<br />
<br />
At once, a dark, tall, handsome, sullen-looking man, known<br />
<br />
as JACKSON STRYKER, takes the podium.  In truth, it is RAYNE SOMMERS.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  CHARLIE'S BEDROOM<br />
<br />
Charles spots the man he knows in their time as Rayne Sommers taking the podium.  He begins to realize a new timeline has begun to unfold before his eyes on the screen.  Someone has tampered with time!<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	What are you doing here?<br />
<br />
EXT.  --  PRESIDENTIAL FORUM/ PODIUM<br />
<br />
			JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
	People!  Listen to me!<br />
<br />
			ANGRY MOB MEMBER #5<br />
<br />
	(hearing familiar voice, turns)  Stryker.<br />
<br />
	It's Stryker!<br />
<br />
Quickly, the crowd turns silent.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT.  Wilhelmina, with her cameraman, still reporting furiously--on the condition of the president.<br />
<br />
			WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
         Ladies and gentlemen.  The president has been shot.<br />
<br />
         No word yet as to his condition.<br />
<br />
As the crowd presses in towards Stryker, the police, secret service struggle to hold them back.<br />
<br />
			JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
         Please.  Everyone.  Let the authorities do<br />
<br />
         their jobs.<br />
<br />
Behind Jackson/Rayne, stand TRENTON SOMMERS. He grabs hold of Rayne.<br />
<br />
			TRENTON<br />
<br />
	(whispering, angry) This wasn't in our bargain.<br />
<br />
			JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
        It is now.--Don't tell me you've gotten cold<br />
<br />
        feet already.<br />
<br />
			TRENTON<br />
<br />
        I thought we were going to wait until after<br />
<br />
        the election to kill Cahill.<br />
<br />
			JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
        Haven't you gotten it yet, you fool? You were<br />
<br />
        the one who was supposed to die tonight--on<br />
<br />
        this platform!â€”And now the world is oursâ€”ripe<br />
<br />
        for the taking!  Now let me finish!<br />
<br />
Trenton is silenced momentarily.  Jackson/Rayne returns to the crowd.<br />
<br />
			JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
        Please, everyone, go home.  Put aside your<br />
<br />
        anger. I, Jackson Stryker, when elected as<br />
<br />
        your president, promise you that my administration will<br />
<br />
        do what Cahill's failed to do these last four yearsâ€”<br />
<br />
        LEAD THIS COUNTRY into a new era of peace and of world<br />
<br />
        class status and renewed power!<br />
<br />
The crowd roars.  Trenton grabs Rayne again.<br />
<br />
		        TRENTON<br />
<br />
        What the hell are you doing?<br />
<br />
		        JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
        What the hell do you think I'm doing?  Now shut up<br />
<br />
        and take the oath of officeâ€”like a man!<br />
<br />
		        TRENTON<br />
<br />
        You're mad.<br />
<br />
			JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
        And you don't deserve what I'm about to hand<br />
<br />
        you on a silver platter.  Some men never do<br />
<br />
        seem to learn.  If you want to have power,<br />
<br />
        this is how you take it.<br />

<br />
         (to another serviceman entering scene) Get<br />
<br />
          them off the stage.  Now!<br />
<br />
Rayne reaches into an inner coat pocket, pulling out a derringer-sized pistol. Holding next to his body it so no one can see it, he turns toward the podium as if he's going to speak again and, instead, shoots himself in the abdomen, making sure the wound is not fatal.  Falling into the arms of Trenton, he quickly shoves the pistol into his hands.<br />
<br />
			RAYNE<br />
<br />
        (whispers) Hide this in my machine.<br />
<br />
SOUND:  MORE GUNSHOTS.  MORE SCREAMS.<br />

			VOICE ON PLATFORM<br />
<br />
	Someone administer the oath of office to<br />
<br />
	Vice-president Sommers.<br />
<br />
As more Secret Service, policemen rush in, Trenton Sommers and the remainder of the political guests are ushered from the platform.  Jackson/Rayne is taken away on a stretcher by paramedics as people in the crowd surrounding the platform are quickly arrested and/or scattered by the authorities.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT:  A second secret serviceman kneels beside the president's body, trying to find a pulse, as more paramedics rush in to tend to Cahill.<br />
<br />
			SECRET SERVICEMAN #2<br />
<br />
	I can't feel a pulse. I think he's dead.<br />

A judge administers the oath of office to Trenton as the dignitaries are escorted away from the chaos.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  CHARLIE'S ROOM<br />
<br />
Charles's eyes remain fixed on the tube as a pretty young woman, about thirty, enters.  She takes hold of Charles' arm, cradling it, watching what's happening.  It's KATHRYN MARTEL, Charlie's/Charles's mother.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
	The world as we know it is over, isn't it?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Wasn't Trenton Sommers the one who was killed that<br />
<br />
        night?<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
	History was never your best subject in school.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        (not convinced)  I'm sure it was Sommers.  Something's<br />
<br />
        wrong here, Mom.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
	You didn't . . .<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	No.  (trying not to alarm her)  But someone, I<br />
<br />
        think, did.  Maybe that's what Ed was trying to tell me before . . .<br />
<br />
Charles hops to the computer, scavenging his Encyclopedia flash drives until he finds what he's looking for:  Trenton Sommers' biog and obituary.  He then hits the Internet for news on Stryker and Cahill and what is currently happening on the television.  He finds a news bulletin with Rayne Sommers' picture/profile labeled as Senator Jackson Stryker, along with the breaking news about Cahill's assassinationâ€”and the resulting riot.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        (to self)  It's Sommers, all right.  Mom,<br />
<br />
        I don't like the looks of this.  I'm leaving<br />
<br />
        you and Charlie my gunâ€”just in case.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
	Oh no, Charlie, they're so dangerous.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        It'll keep you and Charlie safe until you're<br />
<br />
        out of the country and headed north.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
	No, Charlie.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Mother!<br />
<br />
Kathryn reluctantly takes the gun.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
	Are you sure we have to leave?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Only until things have calmed down again.<br />
<br />
        And then you can come back--if you want to.<br />
<br />
		        KATHRYN<br />
<br />
        Charlie, I'm so afraid.  Please don't leave<br />
<br />
        us the gun. It won't do us any good anyway.<br />
<br />
		        CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Then hide it in my desk at Acceleron after I leave.â€”I<br />
<br />
        insist.  There's a secret compartment behind the top<br />
<br />
        right-hand drawer.  Ask for an Ed Saunders when you get<br />
<br />
        there.  It was his desk before it was mine.  Explain<br />
<br />
        everything to him.  He'll understand.<br />
<br />
Kathryn reluctantly agrees.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
	When are you leaving?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        In the morning.  I've got a couple of things to do and<br />
<br />
        then I'll come right back. (another pause to watch the<br />
<br />
        mayhem on the television) Maybe Ed and the boys can help<br />
<br />
        me figure out how Sommers changed the timeline, so I can<br />
<br />
        fix it back when I return.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
	(distressed)  Be careful, Charlie.  That<br />
<br />
	Senator Stryker looks like a very dangerous<br />
<br />
	man.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        It's not him I'm worried about. . . Just keep remembering<br />
<br />
        the world does survive, Mom.  We survive.  And go to Canada<br />
<br />
        as we planned. Please?<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
        When I first saw you like thisâ€”all grown up, learning<br />
<br />
        there were such things in the universe as time travel<br />
<br />
       (smiles feeling a great peace in her heart) . . . forget<br />
<br />
        about the damned politicians.  They've never really<br />
<br />
        cared about us anyway, only what was in it for them.<br />
<br />
       (toward television) In a few more days, it won't matter<br />
<br />
       anyway who's our president.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        What does matter is that you and Charlie will<br />
<br />
        be gone from this place.  You'll be safe--in Canada.<br />
<br />
        Everything will be okay until I get back.  I promise.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
        How long do we have until they drop the bomb<br />
<br />
        on Washington?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Not long.  Only a couple of days.<br />
<br />
Kathryn clings to Charles as they stare at the TV together.<br />
<br />
			NEWSCASTER'S VOICE<br />
<br />
         President Mars Cahill, news reporter Wilhelmina Jones and<br />
<br />
         her cameraman, Alan Remington, are dead . . .<br />
<br />
TIME LAPSE.<br />
<br />
EXT.  --  KATHRYN'S HOME/ BACKYARD  --  EARLY NEXT MORNING<br />
<br />
Charles is ready to leave, back to the future. His TIME MACHINE looks like an ordinary beat up old truck and camper instead of a time travel vehicle.  The 5100 computer is safely stashed away in the back.  Young Charlie plays in the distance as Kathryn emerges from the back door of her house, a jacket in hand for Charles.  She also has with her his flash drives he left in Charlie's computer.  The air is clean, fresh, the rural scenery just outside Washington D.C. is green, pristine as a cool, crisp, early spring morning.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
       Here.  You almost forgot these. (gives Charles<br />
<br />
       his flash drives)  You don't need anyone finding these here.<br />
<br />
       (helps him with jacket) It'll be cold where you're going.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	You're such a worry wart.  Thanks, Mom.<br />
<br />
Charles tucks his flash drives away in his jacket pocket, as Kathryn fawns over her grown son a bit longer.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        You've got your plane tickets?  Passports?<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
        Yes. We leave in two hours.â€”I hear Canada's really<br />
<br />
        nice this time of year.  Especially in the mountains.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Good.  You're okay with it.  In a few years you'll<br />
<br />
        be able to come back home and start over again.<br />
<br />
        And I'll be here to help.  It won't be the same,<br />
<br />
        but it'll be okay.<br />
<br />
Charles gives his mother a long hug/kiss goodbye.  In turn, Kathryn gives him one last gift to take with him, placing it around his neck:  a Saint Christopher's medallion.  But Charles objects.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Mom, this isn't . . .<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
	It will keep you safe.  Humor meâ€”for once.<br />
<br />
Charles tacitly accepts.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
         I'll see you in Canada.  Say goodbye to<br />
<br />
Charlie for me. He must never know.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
         I know.  You take care of yourself,<br />
<br />
        'Charlie.'  I want lots of grandchildrenâ€”<br />
<br />
        and you're getting up there in age.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Ariel is still young enough.  We'll name<br />
<br />
        our first daughter after you.â€”I'm gonna<br />
<br />
        miss your vegetable garden.<br />
<br />
They laugh.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
	I'm glad we had this time together.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	So am I.<br />
<br />
They hug.  Charles takes out his communicator.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Ed.  Do you read me?  Over.<br />
<br />
Still no answer from Ed. SOUND: ONLY STATIC FILLS THE AIRWAVES.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Ed.--I'm on my way. (puts communicator away, mumbles<br />
<br />
        to self) Okay, Charlie. So, Ed's not answering, let's<br />
<br />
        go see what else has been changed--in your present.<br />
<br />
        Charles gets into the beat-up old camper/truck.  The<br />
<br />
        two say their last goodbyes as Charles turns on his<br />
<br />
        machine and readies to leave.  He checks to see young<br />
<br />
        Charlie isn't watching and, then, disappears.<br />
<br />
INT.  -â€“  TIME MACHINE, IN LIMBO<br />
<br />
Charles is on route to 2056 A. D.<br />
<br />
			COMPUTER VOICE<br />
<br />
	Accelerating to sixty-five hours per second.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Computer.  Could we make a quick stop at that little<br />
<br />
        out of the way flower and candy shop we found in 2036?<br />
<br />
        I need to pick something up for Ariel.<br />
<br />
			COMPUTER VOICE<br />
<br />
	What flower and candy shop were you referring<br />
<br />
	to?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	(puzzled) Don't you remember?<br />
<br />
The computer beeps, flashes 2056 is fast approaching.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Okay then.  Take me home.<br />
<br />
Machine accelerates.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  KATHRYN'S HOME 2056 A. D., CHARLIE'S WORKSHOP/GARAGE  --  DAY<br />
<br />
Home.  As Charles emerges from his machine and steps foot into the garage/workshop he had added on to the house as an adult, everything, at first, 'appears' as he left it.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Mom.  I'm home.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  LIVING AREA<br />
<br />
But things are beginning to look frighteningly different, as Charles strolls further into the house.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Mom?<br />
<br />
It looks like the place has been deserted--for quite some time.  Charles spots mail piled up on the floor by the front door, untouched for days. Picking up the letter lying on top of the pile, he reads 'SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME.'  The letter is addressed to his mother c/o a BRYCE KENYON.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Bryce Kenyon?  Who's Bryce Kenyon?<br />
<br />
Charles opens, reads it.  It's about his mother's stay at the facility.   A large of money is owed them.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Nursing home?  Mom's in a nursing home?<br />
<br />
        Maybe getting those plane tickets wasn't<br />
<br />
        such a hot idea after all.<br />
<br />
Charles spots a set of car keys on the lamp stand in the hallwayâ€”next to the phone and picture of his fianc, Ariel Du Bois. Ariel isn't alone in the picture. A younger man, looking very much like Charles (but it isn't Charles) is holding her.   He is bald, wears a distinguished alternative band type beard, and is extremely good looking.  Charles notices the phone's message machine is blinking.  He plays the messages.  They're from Ariel.<br />
<br />
			FIRST PHONE MESSAGE:  ARIEL<br />
<br />
        Bryce.  It's me.  Ariel.  Where are you?  I've been<br />
<br />
        calling and calling. I'm starting to get<br />
<br />
        a bit worried.  I hope you haven't forgotten<br />
<br />
        our little dinner engagement. It's still on<br />
<br />
        for tomorrow night. (pause, silence)  Okay.<br />
<br />
        I'll try again later.<br />
<br />
SOUND:  BEEP.<br />
<br />
			SECOND PHONE MESSAGE:  ARIEL<br />
<br />
        It's me again.  Don't forget.  It's black tie.  I'll<br />
<br />
        wait for you at the restaurant.  Bye.<br />
<br />
Charles sets the picture back down again and snatches the car keys. Rushing out the door, he finds a car parked in the driveway, climbs in, turns over the engine, and driving off, heads for the nursing home.<br />
<br />
EXT.  --  ON ROUTE TO SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME  --  DAY<br />
<br />
Charles drinks in the brand new world unfolding before his eyes as he speeds toward the nursing home.  Everything now looks more like an armed camp than the Washington, D.C. he left behind.  Troops, tanks, armored vehicles fill the streets.  Military police pound the pavement looking for insurgents and troublemakers as he hurries by.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        (to self) God, Charlie.  What did you come<br />
<br />
        back to?<br />
<br />
Locating the nursing home, he drives into an empty space close to the entrance, gets out, heads for the doors.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME  --  DAY<br />
<br />
Even the nursing home looks more like a concentration camp than a rest home, the workers, aides, nurses all acting like the Gestapo as he enters. Charles spots a DUTY NURSE at one of the stations.  He cautiously approaches.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Excuse me.  Could you tell me where I can<br />
<br />
        find Kathryn Martel?<br />
<br />
			DUTY NURSE<br />
<br />
        She's in room thirty-two, just down the<br />
<br />
        hallway, to your right.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Thank you.<br />
<br />
As Charles starts down the corridor, a SINISTER LOOKING SUIT, hiding in the background, raises a communicator to his lips.<br />
<br />
			SINISTER LOOKING SUIT<br />
<br />
	He's in the building.<br />
<br />
			VOICE ON COMMUNICATOR<br />
<br />
	(acknowledging)  Roger.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE ROOM THIRTY-TWO<br />
<br />
Charles spots the room as the door opens.  A nurse pushing a medications cart exits.  He waits for the nurse to leave before entering.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  ROOM THIRTY-TWO<br />
<br />
It is a pleasant room.  A silver-haired old woman, about 75, sits in her rocking chair by her bed.  She stares out a picture window overlooking the gardens.  She appears almost catatonic.  Her back is turned to Charles, but he can tell by the shape of her head, the woman is his mother.  He walks over to her, kneeling beside the chair, to find the once beautiful face he left behind, now full of scars from old wounds left from the war.  He is shocked.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Mom.  Mom?  It's Charlie, your son.  I'm<br />
<br />
        home.--You were fine when I left.  What<br />
<br />
        happened to you?<br />
<br />
Kathryn rocks and rocks just staring out the window unable to speak. A tear trickles down her cheek.<br />
<br />
			KATHRYN<br />
<br />
        I have no son.  Charlie died long agoâ€”-in<br />
<br />
        the war.<br />
<br />
Charles startles.  He hears another duty nurse entering and rises.<br />
<br />
	 		CHARLES<br />
<br />
       What did you do to her?â€”-She was fine when I left.<br />
<br />
			DUTY NURSE #2<br />
<br />
       Sir, I have no idea what you're talking about.  Mrs.<br />
<br />
       Martel has been here for over forty years.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Forty years?  But that's impossible. I sent<br />
<br />
        her to Canada.<br />
<br />
			NURSE<br />
<br />
        I don't know anything about that, Sir.  Mrs.<br />
<br />
        Martel was a victim of the warâ€”when the bomb<br />
<br />
        hit Washington.<br />
<br />
Two policemen burst into the room, followed by the sinister looking suit.<br />
<br />
			SINISTER LOOKING SUIT<br />
<br />
	Charles Martel?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Who wants to know?<br />
<br />
			SINISTER LOOKING SUIT<br />
<br />
        You're under arrest for the murder of Deputy Chief<br />
<br />
        Marian Brooks (looks into his little black notebook)<br />
<br />
        and her assistant, a Miss Ariel Du Bois.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        confused) Deputy Chief Brooks . . . Ariel<br />
<br />
        . . . murdered?<br />
<br />
			SINISTER LOOKING SUIT<br />
<br />
	TAKE HIM!<br />
<br />
As the policemen move in to arrest him, Charles realizes he must flee, fight or face death.  Running for his life, smashing, crashing, fights his way out of the nursing home.  A long, grueling chase, Charles finally reaches familiar ground, ACCELERON CORP.  The buildings are empty, long abandoned, barbed wire around the entrances, NO TRESSPASSING SIGNS are everywhere.  Finding a little known entranceway, eluding the police, Charles disappears into the concrete buildings, heading directly for the offices where he works/worked.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  CHARLES'S ACCELERON WORK AREA  --  DARK<br />
<br />
Dust, cobwebs everywhere, the offices appear to have, otherwise, changed very little.  All is pretty much as he remembersâ€”just abandoned.  Charles begins to rummage around for clues that could possibly tell him what happened.<br />
<br />
SOUND:  POLICE SIRENS BLARE IN THE DISTANCE.<br />
<br />
Charles locates his desk.  The few items he left behind are still on it:  another set of his FLASH DRIVE ENCYCLOPEDIA collection, the same well-worn paperback novels he had when he was a boy, some old papers, a logbook, a picture of Ariel.  He picks up his name-plate, but instead of reading 'Charles Martel,' it reads 'BRYCE KENYON.'  Picking up Ariel's picture, staring at it a few moments, he realizes she is dead now.  He will never see her again.  He puts he picture down again<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        So.  You've been taking care of my mother AND romancing<br />
<br />
        my girl.  And it pretty much looks like you've taken over<br />
<br />
        my job here at Acceleron, tooâ€”if that still exists.  What<br />
<br />
        else have you stolen that was mine, Mr. Bryce Kenyon?<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Charles remembers something. Reaching into the back of one of the drawers of his deskâ€”-he finds the secret compartment Ed had built into it long ago.  He rummages around a minute, finding something familiar-feeling.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	It is here.<br />
<br />
The handgun he left with his mother years ago and the cartridges.  Pulling it out from its hiding place, he checks it out.  It still looks quite new, usableâ€”for an old gun.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
         Good, old Ed and his secret compartments.  I<br />
<br />
         knew you'd come through.  Thanks, Mom.<br />
<br />
Tucking the gun in his pants, Charles explores further. He spots a stack of old news magazines neatly piled on another, extremely well-organizedâ€”very clean desk. Grinning, he goes over to look at them a moment.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
         Still the same old neat freak in this<br />
<br />
         timeline, too, eh, Ed?  Well at least, you<br />
<br />
         haven't changed.<br />
<br />
Charles breathes a small sigh of relief until he finds a DEAD BODY lying on the floor behind the next desk, dressed in a similar uniform he encountered at the nursing home.  Charles continues to rifle through, trying to learn what he can about the timeline he's found himself in. He finds a news magazine on one of the abandoned desks: 'THE NEW ALEXANDER FOR A NEW AGE.  RAYNE SOMMERS, CONQUERER, HERO.'  There is another face is in the picture beside Sommers': that of DR. HAYDEN PRESCOTT'S.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
         Well, well, well.  Mr. President and CEO OF<br />
<br />
         ACCELERON, INK. It was you in that broadcast.<br />
<br />
         What have you been up to latelyâ€”as if I needed<br />
<br />
         to ask.<br />
<br />
SOUND:  THE CLICK OF A GUN TRIGGER COCKING INTO PLACE.<br />
<br />
Slowly raising his hands over his head, Charles can almost feel the gun barrel, and its holder, breathing down his neck.<br />
<br />
			ED'S VOICE<br />
<br />
        I don't know who you are, pal, but if I find you're<br />
<br />
        another one of Herr Sommers' men come to snoop<br />
<br />
        around here again, you're gonna be as dead as the<br />
<br />
        first one over there in about two shakes of a lamb's<br />
<br />
        tail.<br />
<br />
Charles drops his hands, breathing a sigh of relief, recognizing the voice.<br />
<br />
 			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Ed.  It's me, Charlie.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	I said--DON'T MOVE, MISTER!<br />
<br />
SOUND:  MORE TRIGGERS COCKING INTO PLACE.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Charles finds himself at the business end of several automatic rifles, all pointing at him, held by a dirty, scraggly, dressed in camouflage khakis and bullets, ragtag band of freedom fighters--looking ready for a fightâ€”and as if they haven't bathed in weeks.  Ed, Charles' old buddy and Acceleron colleague, is their leader.  The all businesswoman with them is Ed's daughter, Emily. Her teenage son, DANIEL, stands beside.  The odd-looking hippie fellow, George, and the very grizzly bear of a brute, Thomas, complete the group.  Charles readily recognizes all of them, but he is finding out rapidly, they have a lot of trouble recognizing him.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Okay.  I'm not moving.<br />
<br />
			(beat)<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	(pondering)  You sure do seem to know me.<br />
<br />
	But I'll be damned if I can recall you.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Martel's the name.  Charles Martel.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        The name does sound sort of familiar.<br />
<br />
		(beat)<br />
<br />
	Search him.<br />
<br />
Emily, Thomas frisk Charles as George remains at a window keeping surveillance. He spots some suspicious activity outside on a far-off hill by a dugout cave where Acceleron used to do its more risky testings and observes for the time being, just to make certain. Thomas promptly finds Charles's gun, tosses it to Ed.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	My, my, my.  It seems you knew right where<br />
<br />
	to find this. (pockets it)  I'll just keep<br />
<br />
	it for the time being.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I--my uncle used to work for Acceleron.  His<br />
<br />
	name was Charles Martel.  That was in his<br />
<br />
	deskâ€”where I found it.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	I think you'd better try again, Mr. Martel.<br />
<br />
	I think it was Bryce Kenyon's deskâ€”where<br />
<br />
	you found the gun.<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
	Ed.  Looks like we got a little company.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	Keep an eye on 'em, George.<br />
<br />
Emily finds the flash drives.  She throws them over to Ed.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
        Looks like our friend here's been scavenging around<br />
<br />
        a lot more than he's been letting on.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Those are mine.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
       (pocketing drives)  Well, we'll just see about that.<br />
<br />
        I'll have Daniel take a look at 'em<br />
<br />
        when we get back to headquarters.<br />
<br />
  Emily, Thomas continue their search.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        I'm sure you've also heardâ€”somewhere around<br />
<br />
        town . . .<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
        (looking closely, directly into Charles'<br />
<br />
        eyes)  We've seen the wanted posters.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
	He's clean now.<br />
<br />
Ed sits down on a nearby desk, pulls out a cigar, lights it, takes a puff.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        Wasn't the one woman who was killed, Ariel Du<br />
<br />
        Bois, Bryce's fianc?<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
        I'll never understand what he saw in her.<br />
<br />
        Those kind of women, they're all shallow--and<br />
<br />
        vain.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
        Are you kidding?  A looker like Ariel Du Bois?<br />
<br />
        Give me shallow and vain anytime.<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
        (chuckling, directed at Charles)  If you ask<br />
<br />
        me, I think she's just jealous.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	Men. You're all alike.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	Don't start, Emily.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Ariel wasn't like that.  I was framed.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	That's what they all say.<br />
<br />
Ed takes another, thought-filled puff.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        You say you knew Ariel Du Bois?--Just what<br />
<br />
        kind of nefarious connections do you have<br />
<br />
        with Herr Sommersâ€”besides being wanted for<br />
<br />
        two murders?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	None.<br />
<br />
Emily pokes him hard in the side with her gun.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I swear!<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	He's lying.  You can see it in his eyes.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        I'm not lying.--My uncle worked for him at Acceleron.<br />
<br />
        That's all.  (frustrated/angry) Could you remove that<br />
<br />
        thing--please?<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	Emily.<br />
<br />
Emily finally backs off.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        I'd bet money Sommers is the one who had<br />
<br />
        Ariel murdered--and sentenced my mother to<br />
<br />
        thatâ€”concentration camp of a nursing home.<br />
<br />
		        ED<br />
<br />
        (sarcastically)  Director Sommersâ€”a murderer?<br />
<br />
         Now where did you ever get that idea?<br />
<br />
Ed approaches Charles, looks him straight in the eyesâ€”as if he's about to strike him hard.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        Anyone who speaks in that tone of voice against<br />
<br />
        Director Rayne Sommers can't be all bad. (offers<br />
<br />
        a friendly hand)  I'm Ed Saunders.<br />
<br />
They shake.  Ed pulls out a second cigar, hands it to Charles.  Charles lights up, taking a long puff with Ed.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	Havana.  Can you still get these?<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        Let's just say I still have a few well placedâ€”<br />
<br />
        friends in Washington who can work a miracle or<br />
<br />
        two when I need 'em.  These are my boys, George,<br />
<br />
        Thomas.<br />
<br />
They greet each other.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	You'll have to forgive my daughter.  Emily's<br />
<br />
	a bit outspoken on more than a few subjects.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
        Like men who act like little boys over<br />
<br />
        floosies like Ariel Du Bois?  My apologies,<br />
<br />
        Mr. Martel.  One can never be too careful<br />
<br />
        these days.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
         You make Ariel sound like she was some gold-<br />
<br />
         digger.  She wasn't. She was a good personâ€”<br />
<br />
         And you're right, Thomas.  She was some looker.<br />
<br />
The boy approaches Ed, Charlie.<br />
<br />
			DANIEL<br />
<br />
	  Grandpa?  When are we leaving?<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
          (arm to shoulder hug) This is my grandson,<br />
<br />
          Daniel, my pride and joy.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
          Nice to meet you, Daniel.  He looks a<br />
<br />
          little bit like you, Ed.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	  Don't he for a fact?  We'll be leaving<br />
<br />
	  shortly, son.<br />
<br />
Daniel turns back to rummaging around the area.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	  You've got quite a family, Ed Saunders.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
          Can't be a job that brings you here to<br />
<br />
          Acceleron.<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
          Cos' there ain't been none since Sommers<br />
<br />
          handed over the whole kit and caboodle to<br />
<br />
          that Hayden Prescott fella.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
          Prescott's had everything bottled up for<br />
<br />
          years with his cronies.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
          Iâ€”my uncle used to work for the company.  We<br />
<br />
          share the same name actually.  I just thought<br />
<br />
          I might find somebody here who remembered him.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
	  Don't recall a Charles Martel. Do you, Ed?<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	  What division did your uncle work for?<br />
<br />
 			CHARLES<br />
<br />
          He worked in the labs mostly--on experimental stuff.â€”<br />
<br />
          And he traveled a lot for Acceleron.<br />
<br />
		        ED<br />
<br />
          No. Don't seem to recall anybody by that name working here.<br />
<br />
		        CHARLES<br />
<br />
          He was gone most of the time.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
          Did he ever talk to you about Acceleron's<br />
<br />
	  dream team?<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
          The baby Einsteins, that's what Trenton Sommers<br />
<br />
          used to call us.  Back in the golden days, when<br />
<br />
          we were a whole lot younger, and the company<br />
<br />
          didn't belong to just one man.  That U. S. Senatorâ€”<br />
<br />
          what was his name again, George? You know, the one<br />
<br />
          that ended up missing after that riot just before<br />
<br />
          the war began?<br />
<br />
		       GEORGE<br />
<br />
         You mean Jackson Stryker?<br />
<br />
		       ED<br />
<br />
         That's the one.  Nice man, too.  Or, at least,<br />
<br />
         I thought he was when he turned over all his<br />
<br />
         stock in the company to Trenton's boy, Rayne,<br />
<br />
         just before he disappeared and Sommers took<br />
<br />
         the company over.  He treated us good, and<br />
<br />
         paid us all very well, too.  Until that one<br />
<br />
         idea we came up with.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
        And then, one night he just up and fired George and me<br />
<br />
        â€”and turned everything over that Doctor Prescott.<br />
<br />
		       GEORGE<br />
<br />
         I still think we did it, and one day I'm<br />
<br />
         going to prove it to the whole world!<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
         George still has pretty bitter memories over<br />
<br />
         that incident.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
         He's not the only one, Ed.  The night of the riot,<br />
<br />
         the night Stryker disappeared, things weren't<br />
<br />
         supposed to happen that way.  It was supposed to be<br />
<br />
         a peaceful demonstration, not a bloodbath.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
         When you're a man obsessed with power and<br />
<br />
         hold the key to unlocking the secrets of<br />
<br />
         the universe to get that power . . .<br />
<br />
		        ED<br />
<br />
         Emily, we still can't prove any of that.<br />
<br />
		        EMILY<br />
<br />
         But it's the truth, Dad, the night they<br />
<br />
         Fired Thomas and George, and almost got<br />
<br />
         rid of you, too.<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
        We just wanted Cahill and Sommers out on<br />
<br />
        their earsâ€”for good.  Didn't stop to think<br />
<br />
        our little protest might be putting a<br />
<br />
        dictator into power.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	That's what happened?  Rayne Sommers is<br />
<br />
	dictator because of Acceleron?<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	And his fatherâ€”once he got into office and<br />
<br />
	forced Congress to change the Constitution.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
       So, what you're saying is Trenton Sommers is pretty much<br />
<br />
       responsible for this whole thing.<br />
<br />
		       THOMAS<br />
<br />
       Shutting down Acceleronâ€”making our country<br />
<br />
       into one solid concentration camp?  I'd<br />
<br />
       say so.<br />
<br />
		       ED<br />
<br />
       He did have a little help from Jackson Stryker.<br />
<br />
		       THOMAS<br />
<br />
       They were all in on it.<br />
<br />
		       GEORGE<br />
<br />
       That's why we're hereâ€”like we are now.<br />
<br />
		       ED<br />
<br />
       Our last little project,â€”the one your uncle was probably<br />
<br />
       working on, tooâ€”the one Stryker and Sommers shut Acceleron<br />
<br />
       down over.<br />
<br />
		       EMILY<br />
<br />
      (hugging dad)  They had discovered time travel-- a way to<br />
<br />
      travel through time and were about to release a statement<br />
<br />
      to the press when . . .<br />
<br />
		       GEORGE<br />
<br />
       That prig Sommers fired us and turned everything over to<br />
<br />
       his crony, Prescott.<br />
<br />
		        ED<br />
<br />
       But that's not the entire story.  George's been<br />
<br />
       having these dreams, flashbacksâ€”of a different memory,<br />
<br />
       a different timeline--lately.<br />
<br />
		        GEORGE<br />
<br />
       You see, Prescott thought he had destroyed the<br />
<br />
       original blueprints, the hard copies, of our machine.<br />
<br />
       But, somehow, I keep remembering that  I hid them<br />
<br />
       away in an old computer program nobody can read anymore,<br />
<br />
       except Thomas, Daniel and me.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	We're here to get the real, original blueprints.<br />
<br />
        We think somehow Sommers found a way to alter the<br />
<br />
        original timeline in order to seize powerâ€”and we<br />
<br />
        want to find a way to change it back.  Without<br />
<br />
        a machine . . .<br />
<br />
                         ED<br />
<br />
         We have no way.<br />
<br />
		        CHARLES<br />
<br />
         Where's this computer program now?<br />
<br />
Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, George spots some men racing down the hill, toward the building the troupe presently occupies.<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
        Ed, we got a few heading toward the building.<br />
<br />
Ed goes over to check on the men descending the hill.  Charles  accompanies him.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	You know, Ed.  George is right about one<br />
<br />
	thing.<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
	What's that?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	You did break the time barrier.<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
	I knew it!<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	And I'm your living proof.  You know that<br />
<br />
	uncle I was telling you about?â€”I don't<br />
<br />
	have an Uncle named Charles Martel.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        You know, I thought there was something about<br />
<br />
        you I couldn't quite put my finger on.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Just wait til you hear the rest of my story.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
I'll bet it's a doozy.  Come on.  Before those men find us and figure out what we're doing here.<br />
<br />
(beat) We can take the back way out. (men move from window)<br />
<br />
			DANIEL<br />
<br />
	Grandpa.<br />
<br />
Daniel shows Ed flash drives he found on Bryce's desk.<br />
<br />
			DANIEL<br />
<br />
        They were right where Bryce left them.  He<br />
<br />
        didn't lie.<br />
<br />
Ed gives Charles a long, peculiar lookâ€”and then hands Charles his flash drives back.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	I know he didn't, son.  Charlie Martel, if<br />
<br />
        you're really what you say you are, you and me<br />
<br />
        are going to get along in this timeline just fine.<br />
<br />
		CHARLES<br />
<br />
        I am.<br />
<br />
A gas canister enters the building shattering a window and spewing out clouds of smoke, as Daniel pockets the flash drives he found.  Rushing to protect themselves, George spots the two more men rushing toward the building.<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
	Looks like there's a whole damned army<br />
<br />
	coming down the hill out there.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        (to Charles)  George likes to exaggerate.<br />
<br />
         How many are there really, George?<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
  	Right now, four.  But there could be more.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	We can take 'em, Ed.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        Emily, you take Daniel out of here.  We'll<br />
<br />
        meet you back at headquarters.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	This is our fight, too.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	Don't argue with me.  Just go.<br />
<br />
Emily, Daniel leave.  Ed tosses Charles's gun back to him.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        Did 'your uncle' ever show you around the old<br />
<br />
        Carter building?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I took a tour once or twiceâ€”when it was the<br />
<br />
	De Haviland Museum.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	Smart nephew.<br />
<br />
SOUND:  GUNSHOTS.  THEN AN EXPLOSION.  Ed, Charles crawl to the windows, peeking out to see what's happening.  They spot two men searching in the debris just created for a way in.  Ed notices their specially trimmed uniforms.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	That's Sommers' elite force out there.<br />
<br />
SOUND:  MORE GUN SHOTS, bullets enter the building near Charles, George, Ed.  Ed, Charles, Thomas, George fire back.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
        Tell me about it.  They were at the nursing<br />
<br />
        home waiting for me.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        Now he tells us.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	You didn't ask.<br />
<br />
One of Sommers' men shouts out.<br />
<br />
			ELITE OFFICER #1<br />
<br />
	Charles Martel.  We know you're in there.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	Sounds like they're out for blood.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	You have to believe me. I didn't murder<br />
<br />
	anybody.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        These bad boys aren't usually sent out to<br />
<br />
         round up murder suspects.<br />
<br />
			ELITE OFFICER #1<br />
<br />
	Come out with your hands up.<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
        (like he's enjoying it)  Boy, you must've<br />
<br />
        done something really good for Sommers to<br />
<br />
        want you this bad.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
	What'd you do, Charlie?  Can you give us a<br />
<br />
	little hint?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I'm still alive.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
	That's threatening enough.<br />
<br />
SOUND:  GUNFIRE.  More bullets enter the building.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	George.  (motions for him to lead the way out)<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	It's hell being so popular.<br />
<br />
SOUND:  MORE WINDOWS SHATTER.  MORE GUNFIRE is exchanged, Thomas stops momentarily. Sommers' elites find a way into the Carter building as another gas container crashes in spewing more smoke as George returns.<br />
<br />
			GEORGE<br />
<br />
	Well, come on!  What're you waiting for?<br />
<br />
Thomas scurries out behind George.  Ed pulls out two handkerchiefs handing one to Charles.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	You never know when you might need one of<br />
<br />
	these.<br />
<br />
Tying them over their mouths, noses:<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	There's an old testing cave out back.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	I know the area.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        We built a back entranceway into it not too<br />
<br />
        many people know about, including Sommers.<br />
<br />
        If we can make it to there, we'll be able<br />
<br />
        to hold them off long enough until we can<br />
<br />
        find a way back to headquarters without them<br />
<br />
        following us.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	You're on, pal.  Lead the way.<br />
<br />
They fight their way out of the building to the . . .<br />
<br />
EXT.  --  STEEP HILL BEHIND CARTER BUILDING  --  DAY<br />
<br />
outside; merging from the Carter Building's back entrance, Ed and Charles climb their way up the hill to where the old testing cave stands.  Half way up, they're met with another barrage of bullets, more agents.  Ed takes one man down, Charles kills a second as they near the cave's entrance, but their luck soon runs out. One of the agents' bullets finds Charles as he nears the boarded up entranceway, grazing his arm, puncturing his leg.<br />
<br />
Ed helps Charles, limping, in.<br />
<br />
INT.  --  TESTING CAVE  --  DARK<br />
<br />
Ed pulls Charles safety, having suffered himself a slight gash on the forehead during the fracas.  Emily and Daniel are there, watching, waiting, with George, Thomas.  Ed is NOT PLEASED seeing Emily and Daniel.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	(removes bandana)<br />
<br />
         I thought I told you two to meet us at headquarters.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	You're hurt.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	Don't change the subject!<br />
<br />
Emily sets right to work, cleaning her father's laceration as Thomas tends to Charles' wounds.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        Your just like your mother.  She wouldn't<br />
<br />
        listen either.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	Shut up and let me take care of you.<br />
<br />
Charles removes his bandana breathing heavily.  He peeks out, trying to get a count of how many men are left gunning for them. He spots several more a distance away.<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	There's still a couple out there.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	I'm sure there're more than just two out<br />
<br />
	there.<br />
<br />
			THOMAS<br />
<br />
        (extracting bullet from leg, tying wound)<br />
<br />
        He'll live.  You're lucky the bullets didn't<br />
<br />
        hit any bones.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	We've got to get them back to headquarters.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        We're not going anywhereâ€”not just yet anyway.<br />
<br />
       â€”But YOU ARE.<br />
<br />
Emily balks.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
        No arguments.  Daniel needs to be in a safe place.<br />
<br />
        George, you and Thomas take Emily and Daniel back<br />
<br />
        to headquarters--now.  Charlie and I've got some<br />
<br />
        work to finish here.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
	Now who's being the stubborn one?<br />
<br />
Ed starts to talk back, but Emily cuts him off.<br />
<br />
			EMILY<br />
<br />
         I know, I know.<br />
<br />
		        ED<br />
<br />
         Good.  Now you're acting like the<br />
<br />
         reasonable daughter raised.<br />
<br />
		        EMILY<br />
<br />
        (kisses father goodbye)  Don't be long.<br />
<br />
They leave.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
	How're your bullets holding up?<br />
<br />
			CHARLES<br />
<br />
	(checking) I think I've got enough.<br />
<br />
			ED<br />
<br />
         Okay. (POV SHOT AGENTS)  You take the ones<br />
<br />
         on the left.  I'll take the ones on the<br />

INT. -- TESTING CAVE -- DARK<br />
<br />
Ed pulls Charles safety, having suffered himself a slight gash on the forehead during the fracas. Emily and Daniel are there, watching, waiting, with George, Thomas. Ed is NOT PLEASED seeing Emily and Daniel.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
(removes bandana)<br />
<br />
I thought I told you two to meet us at headquarters.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
You're hurt.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Don't change the subject!<br />
<br />
Emily sets right to work, cleaning her father's laceration as Thomas tends to Charles' wounds.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Your just like your mother. She wouldn't<br />
<br />
listen either.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
Shut up and let me take care of you.<br />
<br />
Charles removes his bandana breathing heavily. He peeks out, trying to get a count of how many men are left gunning for them. He spots several more a distance away.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
There's still a couple out there.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
I'm sure there're more than just two out<br />
<br />
there.<br />
<br />
THOMAS<br />
<br />
(extracting bullet from leg, tying wound)<br />
<br />
He'll live. You're lucky the bullets didn't<br />
<br />
hit any bones.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
We've got to get them back to headquarters.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
We're not going anywhereâ€”not just yet anyway.<br />
<br />
â€”But YOU ARE.<br />
<br />
Emily balks.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
No arguments. Daniel needs to be in a safe place.<br />
<br />
George, you and Thomas take Emily and Daniel back<br />
<br />
to headquarters--now. Charlie and I've got some<br />
<br />
work to finish here.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
Now who's being the stubborn one?<br />
<br />
Ed starts to talk back, but Emily cuts him off.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
I know, I know.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Good. Now you're acting like the<br />
<br />
reasonable daughter raised.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
(kisses father goodbye) Don't be long.<br />
<br />
They leave.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
How're your bullets holding up?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(checking) I think I've got enough.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Okay. (POV SHOT AGENTS) You take the ones<br />
<br />
on the left. I'll take the ones on the<br />
<br />
right.<br />
<br />
They take aim. As Sommers' men attempt to rush the cave, Charles, Ed answer back with precision marksmanship, felling Sommers' men.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
We're not out of the woods yet.<br />
<br />
Ed helps Charles up and down the pathway<br />
<br />
toward the secret back entrance.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Just a few more yards to go. How's your<br />
<br />
leg holding up?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It could be better. Let's just get us out<br />
<br />
of here.<br />
<br />
They hobble down the path together a few more steps.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Bet you didn't know you were going to have<br />
<br />
this much fun when we first met.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Just barrels. Remind me to tell you again<br />
<br />
when this is all over.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
You got yourself a deal.<br />
<br />
Charles pauses a moment.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
You're a sick man, Ed Saunders.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Rayne Sommers made us all this way.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
Come on. We're almost there.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'm right with you, Doc.--Just one<br />
<br />
question, though,--before we go.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
What's that?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Who the hell is Bryce Kenyon?<br />
<br />
Ed lets out a hearty laugh.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
And you called me a sick man.<br />
<br />
They exit . . .<br />
<br />
EXT. -- SECRET DOORWAY OUT OF CAVE -- DAY<br />
<br />
. . . into the sunlight and straight into . . .<br />
<br />
SOUND: GUN COCKS CLICKING, barrels pointing directly at the backs of their heads.<br />
<br />
ELITE OFFICER #2<br />
<br />
Right this way, Mr. Martel.<br />
<br />
ELITE OFFICER #3<br />
<br />
You, too, Doctor Saunders.<br />
<br />
Charles, Ed are reluctantly led away.<br />
<br />
ACT II<br />
<br />
INT. -- DIRECTOR SOMMERS' HEADQUARTERS -- DAY<br />
<br />
Rayne Sommers anxiously waits for news of Martel's capture. Two of his elite officers are with him, presently on their phones. Sommers' office is huge, with high, reaching to the ceiling windows overlooking the city streets. His office is draped in typical male dcor. A high technology center is at the hub so he can keep tabs on various parts of the world at any given timeâ€”along with a state of the art transport machine: his personal time machine. Television monitors presently display Fort Knox, the Pyramids, the Louvre, the British Museum, China's Forbidden City, the interior of the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities and many priceless treasures such as the Blue Hope diamond, the Star of Africa diamond in the British Crown Jewels, and artworks and ongoing robberies and armies warring with each other. Sommers' secretary, HANNAH, opens the Director's door, showing DR. HAYDEN PRESCOTT, an exceedingly brilliant, middle-aged man and scientist, in. He carries an array of digital maps, papers, charts, timelines, etc., within a high tech brief case housing a laptop computer. A picture of his LATE brother, Oliver, prominently stands on one of the shelves in the background.<br />
<br />
ELITE OFFICER #4<br />
<br />
I'll let the director know. (hangs up)<br />
<br />
Martel's been capturedâ€”along with Saunders.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Good. (sees Prescott entering) Ah, Doctor<br />
<br />
Prescott. (to officers) If you will excuse<br />
<br />
me, gentlemen. I have something equally as<br />
<br />
pressing to attend to.<br />
<br />
Officers exit.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
(eager) Have you found it?<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
I believe I have.<br />
<br />
Prescott opens his briefcase on a nearby table to reveal a computer screen filled with electronic data. Pulling up a time chart, he points to a very small, highlighted area on the timeline.<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
On the original timeline, the Martels had<br />
<br />
traveled to Nebraska to visit relatives where<br />
<br />
his mother died in the first attacks. A sister,<br />
<br />
Agnes Covington, and her fianc, a Ross Kenyon,<br />
<br />
were supposed to be traveling with them until<br />
<br />
one of Kenyon's reporters and cameramen were<br />
<br />
shot and killed along with your father. In the<br />
<br />
new timeline, Kenyon and Covington went to<br />
<br />
Aspen, Colorado . . .<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Yes, yes, I know all that already. What<br />
<br />
I want to know is how was Martel able to<br />
<br />
change our new timeline so he and his<br />
<br />
mother didn't die, as we had planned, when<br />
<br />
Washington was attacked?<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
Plane tickets.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Plane tickets?<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
He bought plane ticketsâ€”to Canadaâ€”for him<br />
<br />
and his mother.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
I should have known it would be something<br />
<br />
as trivial as plane tickets.<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
Knowing Martel, he could have just overslept<br />
<br />
and corrupted your new timeline. I warned<br />
<br />
you. You had to stay vigilant over every one<br />
<br />
of their new lives you created for themâ€”<br />
<br />
extremely vigilantâ€”over every single detailâ€”<br />
<br />
if you were going to do this.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
So now we have a rift in our new timeline that<br />
<br />
needs to be repaired. How do you propose we<br />
<br />
rectify this--little conundrumâ€”Doctor, before<br />
<br />
Martel destroys all our hard work?<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
I read only two choices here. You can either kill<br />
<br />
Martel outright, now, in this timeline,<br />
<br />
now that your men have captured him. But, if<br />
<br />
you do that, you still run the risk of having<br />
<br />
the five year old Martel growing up and<br />
<br />
changing the new line back at any time in his future.<br />
<br />
But, kill Martel while he's still five years old,<br />
<br />
along with the older counterpart, then, I believe,<br />
<br />
will you have solved your 'little conundrum' permanently<br />
<br />
and repaired your timeline with no further corruption.<br />
<br />
â€”That, and, of course, keeping your time travel<br />
<br />
abilities hidden from the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
You're sure killing the child and the older<br />
<br />
Martel together will solve everything?<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
There's always that small chance I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
But I don't think so. Not the way I'm reading the<br />
<br />
timelines. I've looked at all the possibilities a<br />
<br />
thousand times, and they all point to killing Martel<br />
<br />
before he's old enough to even know he's alive.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
And I that's all I would have to do. Sounds<br />
<br />
almost too simple.<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
Just make certain once, though, you've killed<br />
<br />
the boy you find the original machine and<br />
<br />
destroy that, too. Anyone can change the<br />
<br />
future just by traveling back into the past.<br />
<br />
And I'm certain you wouldn't want to take that<br />
<br />
risk a second time.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
No, I would not.<br />
<br />
Rayne goes to his monitor to speak to his secretary.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Hannah. Send my Chief of Security in.<br />
<br />
A man enters dressed in a similar type of suit worn by the agent in the nursing home.<br />
<br />
SECURITY CHIEF<br />
<br />
They're still not talking, Director.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Burn their eyes out. Castrate them, if you<br />
<br />
have to. Once they've told you where Martel's<br />
<br />
machine is, destroy it.--And then kill Saunders<br />
<br />
along with Martel.<br />
<br />
SECURITY CHIEF<br />
<br />
Anything else, Director?<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Find the rest of that nest of freedom fighters and kill<br />
<br />
them, too. I want all those Acceleron geniuses dead<br />
<br />
before I have to go back. And send a couple of your<br />
<br />
best men to two thousand twelve--to Martel's childhood<br />
<br />
home. Have them make certain--this time--the boy AND<br />
<br />
his mother meet with a terribleâ€”fatal accidentâ€”on their<br />
<br />
way to Canada.<br />
<br />
The security chief acknowledges his orders, turns to leave, but is delayed one more moment by Sommers.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Oh. And make certain nothing else is changed<br />
<br />
in the process.<br />
<br />
SECURITY CHIEF<br />
<br />
Of course, Director. (bows, leaves)<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
(to Prescott) We can't be too careful, can we?<br />
<br />
Prescott nods, leaves. As Rayne looks on, he touches his side where he shot himself at the presidential forumâ€”the healing wound is still sore and tender and hurting him very much.<br />
<br />
DISSOLVE TO:<br />
<br />
INT. -- INTERROGATION ROOM<br />
<br />
Charles receives a thorough pummeling from his INTERROGATOR as he's questioned. Ed, in the background, slumped in his chair, has already received his share.<br />
<br />
INTERROGATOR<br />
<br />
Where is it?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Go to hell.<br />
<br />
INTERROGATOR<br />
<br />
My patience is wearing thin.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
And while you're at it, take Rayne Sommers<br />
<br />
with you.<br />
<br />
INTERROGATOR<br />
<br />
(smacks him another one) Insolent son of<br />
<br />
a . . .<br />
<br />
The interrogator summons a guard standing in the background to approach him. The guard is young, inexperienced.<br />
<br />
INTERROGATOR<br />
<br />
This one's going to be a little harder to<br />
<br />
break than I expected. Keep an eye on them<br />
<br />
until I get back.<br />
<br />
The guard steps to attention. The interrogator exits.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Ed. Are you okay?<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
I didn't tell them a thing, Charlie, if<br />
<br />
that's what you're asking. But I wanted<br />
<br />
to.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It's okay, Ed. We'll find a way to get<br />
<br />
us out of here.<br />
<br />
The young guard approaches the two, threatens physical violence for talking.<br />
<br />
YOUNG GUARD<br />
<br />
Both of you! Shut up!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the guard is attacked, strangled from behind. As Thomas releases the limp, dead body of the young guard, Emily and George rush to untie Charles and Ed.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
(struggling with Ed's ropes) You never do<br />
<br />
make things easy for us. Tom, help me<br />
<br />
with Dad's ropes.<br />
<br />
Thomas goes to help Emily as George finishes with Charles.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
(looks at Charles' face, a few cuts)<br />
<br />
They were still working you when we got<br />
<br />
here, huh?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
The guy's a pansy. A real woos. Couldn't<br />
<br />
feel a thing.<br />
<br />
George laughs, continues to work on the ropes.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
George, do you know how to get to Bryce<br />
<br />
Kenyon's house?<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
What's this fascination you got with Bryce Kenyon?<br />
<br />
Ed is freed from his ropes.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Let's just say for now--he stole my girl.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
And I'm sure she was well worth all of<br />
<br />
this.<br />
<br />
George cracks a laugh at Charles.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
(lowered voice) If I was a few years<br />
<br />
younger myself . . .<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(grins, low voice) She was worth it, all<br />
<br />
right.<br />
<br />
George chuckles again as he releases Charles from his bonds.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I need to get something out of his house<br />
<br />
before Sommers and his goons discover<br />
<br />
where I left it.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Don't tell me you robbed his bank.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Get me to Bryce's and you can see for<br />
<br />
yourself--what it is Sommers is so hot<br />
<br />
for.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
You got yourself a deal, bucko.<br />
<br />
THOMAS<br />
<br />
(picks up Ed, too weak to walk) we've got<br />
<br />
to get him back to headquarters.<br />
<br />
They quickly leave moments before Sommers enters, prepared to interrogate Charles himself, with his interrogator, Prescott, and more guards. Finding his prisoners have escaped, Rayne rages.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Find them! Whatever it takes! Find them<br />
<br />
and kill them! My timeline must be<br />
<br />
preserved at all costs!<br />
<br />
Guards rush out the door, obeying.<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
(aside to Rayne) What about Martel's time machine?<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
It's here. We'll find it. If we have to<br />
<br />
tear down all of Washington. But I want<br />
<br />
Martel deadâ€”now.<br />
<br />
INT. -- FREEDOM FIGHTERS'SECRET HEADQUARTERS -- DARK<br />
<br />
Emily tends to Charles's wounds, Thomas to Ed's as Daniel sits at two computers working on Charles and Bryce's flash drives. Other rebels in the background are hard at work monitoring the outside world on their instruments. Charles flinches from the antiseptic wipes.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Ow! Take it easy with that stuff, will<br />
<br />
you?<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
Sommers' men really did a job on you.<br />
<br />
(at her dad) The both of you. (back<br />
<br />
at Charles) You'll need a couple of<br />
<br />
stitches to close this cut.<br />
<br />
Emily prepares for her bit of surgery on Charles.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
George, do you remember anything else at<br />
<br />
all about that night President Cahill was<br />
<br />
assassinated?<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
(shows old leg scars from bullet wounds)<br />
<br />
Only the souvenirs. I'm lucky I can still<br />
<br />
walk. Bullets tore my leg up pretty bad.<br />
<br />
THOMAS<br />
<br />
You were in a wheel chair six months as I<br />
<br />
recall. And having been fired from Acceleron<br />
<br />
didn't help any. Lost our health insurance.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
I wasn't even born yet.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
That was the night your mother went into<br />
<br />
labor. Otherwise, I would've been there,<br />
<br />
too, fighting along side Thomas and George.<br />
<br />
(to Charles) But that was before the war.<br />
<br />
Why rehash old history?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Because the way I remember history, Edâ€”<br />
<br />
isn'tâ€”exactly the way you all remember it.<br />
<br />
THOMAS<br />
<br />
Ed, could Prescott have completed our lab<br />
<br />
experimentsâ€”and . . .<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
(silently acknowledges Thomas ) And all<br />
<br />
these questions you've been asking about<br />
<br />
Bryce Kenyon.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
In my timeline, Bryce Kenyon doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
DANIEL<br />
<br />
(interrupting) Grandpa. I think you'd better<br />
<br />
come and take a look.<br />
<br />
Ed hobbles to the computer, begins reading the material Daniel's found on Charles' drives.<br />
<br />
DANIEL<br />
<br />
What Mr. Martel said about his historyâ€”it's<br />
<br />
all here on his flash drivesâ€”and on Bryce's<br />
<br />
. . . what we learned in school.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
(to Charles) You could be making this all<br />
<br />
upâ€”just to . . .<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'm not making it up.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
It saysâ€”on your flash drives the vice-<br />
<br />
president was assassinated that night--not Cahill.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
In the true timeline. Sommers was the one<br />
<br />
assassinated. The timeline you're living<br />
<br />
in nowâ€”has been manufactured. Everything<br />
<br />
you know to be true is a lie.<br />
<br />
Ed, Daniel approach Charles.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Okay, Mr. Martel. I don't know what you're<br />
<br />
trying to pull here. But unless you're<br />
<br />
working for Sommers and trying to pull the<br />
<br />
wool over our eyes just so you can get us<br />
<br />
to reveal where we are and what we're doing<br />
<br />
to end Sommer's reign of terror, you'd better<br />
<br />
start explaining yourselfâ€”and fast.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I assure you, Ed, I'm not working for Sommers.<br />
<br />
And, yeah, I do have a lot of explaining to do.<br />
<br />
It's called screwing with time. Sommers did a<br />
<br />
one hell of a job making the world safe for his<br />
<br />
little dictatorship. And the best part of it,<br />
<br />
he used your discovery of time travel to frame<br />
<br />
me for two murders so he can silence you and<br />
<br />
me and George and Thomas forever.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
You're telling us it worked. We really had discover<br />
<br />
time travel the night Sommers shut<br />
<br />
Acceleron's laboratories down. And you're . . .<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Yeah, Ed. I am. I think you realized that<br />
<br />
back at that testing cave when we were taking<br />
<br />
target practice on those men.<br />
<br />
THOMAS<br />
<br />
And all this time we thought Sommers had fired<br />
<br />
us because we screwed up big time, cost the<br />
<br />
company millions of dollars along with its<br />
<br />
reputation in holding that premature press<br />
<br />
conference. We were so sure we had discovered<br />
<br />
time travel.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
You really don't belong hereâ€”do you?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
None of us do, George. And that's why you<br />
<br />
have to help me get back to my time machine.<br />
<br />
So I can go back and repair whatever fracture<br />
<br />
Sommers created in the true timeline. And get<br />
<br />
us all back home againâ€”to our real home.<br />
<br />
Ed<br />
<br />
Put us back the way we were meant to be.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Hot damn! We did it! It worked! It really<br />
<br />
worked!! (laughs) It worked! We really did<br />
<br />
invent time travel!!<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(to George) And you can be the first one to<br />
<br />
see your babyâ€”if you can get me to Bryce's<br />
<br />
house.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
Dad, if what Charles says is true, Rayne Sommers's<br />
<br />
already killed twice. I can't<br />
<br />
let you put yourself or the cause in danger.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Emily. If Sommers really did change history,<br />
<br />
our cause doesn't really exist in the real<br />
<br />
world.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Prescott may have been the one who did all<br />
<br />
the test drivingâ€”and took all the kudos, but<br />
<br />
it's your machine, all right, I've got stowed<br />
<br />
away at Bryce's house.â€”And that's why I need<br />
<br />
to get me back there.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
They could already be watching the house.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I know they are. But I have to take that risk, go<br />
<br />
back into the past again and stop Sommers<br />
<br />
from killing Cahill. And make certain, somehow,<br />
<br />
he never tries to do it again.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
George knows the way from here.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Is there anything else any of you can<br />
<br />
remember about the night Cahill was<br />
<br />
assassinatedâ€”anything that might help me?<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
It was all over the news.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Yeah. That reporter, what was her name again?â€”Jones.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina Jonesâ€”She and her cameraman,<br />
<br />
they were killed in the crossfire.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I think I do remember seeing that on the TV.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
She was always in Cahill's face about<br />
<br />
something or other. I'll bet she could get<br />
<br />
you real close to Cahill. God, he was an<br />
<br />
awful president. No wonder Sommers got away<br />
<br />
with what he did.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Maybe I can start with her.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
(finishing up the stitching)<br />
<br />
You really shouldn't be traveling.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I don't really have much of a choice now, do<br />
<br />
I? George. Help me up.<br />
<br />
George obliges. Gingerly, Charles rises.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
How long do you reckon Sommers' has held our world<br />
<br />
hostageâ€”without anyone's knowledge?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(wincing from the pain) Long enough. And<br />
<br />
I want to get back home again. Thanks,<br />
<br />
George.<br />
<br />
DANIEL<br />
<br />
(fascinated) You really are a time traveler.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I am.<br />
<br />
DANIEL<br />
<br />
The world you left. How different was itâ€”is<br />
<br />
itâ€”from ours?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
When I went back the first time, to see what<br />
<br />
we left behind us, before the war happened, I<br />
<br />
was glad we were finally able to bury it all.<br />
<br />
We were finally finished the hating, the warring,<br />
<br />
killing one another. Those of us who survived<br />
<br />
made a pact with one another--to build a whole,<br />
<br />
brand new worldâ€”one where we could all be free<br />
<br />
and finally live in peace.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
What about guns? Wouldn't you still need guns?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
We tried to destroy them, but unfortunately, there<br />
<br />
were times when we still needed to<br />
<br />
protect ourselves from wild animals and the<br />
<br />
few marauders roaming the outer reaches. The rest<br />
<br />
of the baggage, all the madness, was<br />
<br />
buried with our dead.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
It almost sounds like paradise.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It's been a lot of hard work. A lot of long years.<br />
<br />
But it was working.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
If you go back, can you fix the timeline?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
What I do know from the real flash drives<br />
<br />
and history, Trenton Sommers, not Cahill,<br />
<br />
was supposed to die that night. If I can go back<br />
<br />
to the beginning of that timeline, I believe, yes,<br />
<br />
I can stop Sommers from changing history, and<br />
<br />
restore the original timeline.<br />
<br />
THOMAS<br />
<br />
And give us back the world the way it was<br />
<br />
before Sommers turned it into this hellhole?<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
And give you back Ariel?<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(tearing) I don't know for sure. It might<br />
<br />
not revert back to exactly the way it was.<br />
<br />
Some things might never be able to be fixed.<br />
<br />
But I'm willing to try.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
George, take him to the Arlington Road<br />
<br />
entrance. Use one of the Rovers parked there.<br />
<br />
(offers a hand) We'll be waiting. God speed,<br />
<br />
Charlie Martel.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(they shake) See youâ€”in a suit and tieâ€”and<br />
<br />
those god awful horn-rimmed glasses when I<br />
<br />
get back.<br />
<br />
George, Charles leave the back way out.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- ENROUTE TO KATHRYN MARTEL/BRYCE KENYON'S HOME -- DAY<br />
<br />
The ride is bumpy, erratic as George speeds down a little traveled dirt road. Charles winces at every bump.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
It's really true. You're a real, bona-fide<br />
<br />
time traveler.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Yep. It's true. You can't begin to imagine<br />
<br />
the places I've been to.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Did you get to see the great pyramid being<br />
<br />
built?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
That was next on my list. Actually, I went<br />
<br />
back to watch the Kennedy assassination. I wanted<br />
<br />
to see who was hiding on the grassy knoll.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
(chuckles) So, LBJ really did have him<br />
<br />
assassinated.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(smirks) I'll never tell.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
It wasn't really your uncle who worked for Acceleron.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't have an uncle Charles.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
(laughs) I knew you was just pullin' our<br />
<br />
legs.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I was supposed to have an uncle Ross, though, until<br />
<br />
Aunt Agnes found out he was already<br />
<br />
married and trying to bilk her out of what<br />
<br />
little inheritance my grandparents had left<br />
<br />
her and Mom. Mom was so glad when she finally dumped<br />
<br />
that jerk. Can't seem to recall what he looked liked<br />
<br />
or even recall what his last name was, for that matter,<br />
<br />
it was so long ago. Too busy being a little boy, I<br />
<br />
guess, back then.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
As Emily would say--men.<br />
<br />
They laugh as George hits another solid bump in the road. Charlie winces.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Take it easy, George. I want to get there<br />
<br />
in one piece.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Hey, Charlie. Do you think I could take your<br />
<br />
machine out for a little spin when you get<br />
<br />
back?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Not if you're gonna drive it like this bucket.<br />
<br />
George laughs again.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- KATHRYN MARTEL/BRYCE KENYON'S HOME -- DAY<br />
<br />
As they approach the house from a wooded area behind it, they stop short just behind a hill to reconnoiter the area before proceeding. The house, lawn appear like they've been long abandoned. But they can see from their distance some of Sommers' goons are snooping around the house. One opens his communicator.<br />
<br />
GOON NUMBER #1<br />
<br />
Nothing here. Just an old beat up truck with<br />
<br />
a camper attached to it inside the garage.<br />
<br />
It looks like the whole house has been<br />
<br />
abandonedâ€”for days.<br />
<br />
VOICE ON COMMUNICATOR: PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
Have you seen Martel?<br />
<br />
GOON NUMBER #1<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: GEORGE AND CHARLES WAIT, OBSERVE SOMMERS' GOONS.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
I hope you hid your machine good enough.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(smirking) Right in plain sight.<br />
<br />
George emits another, muffled laugh.<br />
<br />
CUT BACK TO:<br />
<br />
GOON #1.<br />
<br />
VOICE ON COMMUNICATOR: PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
Did you find the machine?<br />
<br />
GOON NUMBER #1<br />
<br />
It's not here. This was Kathryn Martel's<br />
<br />
house?<br />
<br />
VOICE ON COMMUNICATOR: PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
He must have hid it somewhere else. Return<br />
<br />
to headquarters.<br />
<br />
GOON NUMBER #1<br />
<br />
Roger.<br />
<br />
The man motions for the others to end their search. Charles and George continue to watch in the distance as they leave.<br />
<br />
INT. -- SOMMERS' HEADQUARTERS<br />
<br />
Sommers, Prescott are having words.<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
(closes communicator)<br />
<br />
It's not at his mother's house.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
(very upset) It has to be somewhere!<br />
<br />
Sommers begins pacing the floor.<br />
<br />
INTERROGATOR<br />
<br />
Where else do you suggest we look?<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
Martel could very well be on his way back<br />
<br />
into the past right now for all we know.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Or . . . he could still be with those rebels.<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
But if he has gone back . . .<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
I'm well aware, Doctor.<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
That's the only way you're going to insure<br />
<br />
this timeline remains as we created it.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Don't you think I've been thinking about that<br />
<br />
since Martel changed it?<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
I don't think you realize . . .<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
I do realize, all right, I may have to go back and<br />
<br />
relive the whole thing all over again if I want to<br />
<br />
make certain this timeline remains as<br />
<br />
we created itâ€”and that brother of mine remains dead<br />
<br />
and buried in his grave.<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
I've already prepared your machine.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Then, I guess, what am I waiting for?<br />
<br />
PRESCOTT<br />
<br />
And if he hasn't gone back yet?<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Then I will wait for him. And this time,<br />
<br />
instead of shooting myself at the podium,<br />
<br />
I will shoot Martel insteadâ€”to kill.<br />
<br />
Rayne, Prescott head for the machine that is at the far end of his office/headquarters. Rayne enters as Prescott takes to the controls. As the machine begins to whir and hum, Rayne disappears.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- KATHRYN MARTEL/BRYCE KENYON'S HOME<br />
<br />
Charles, finding the key where he left it in the other timeline, and George enter the house through the workshop/garage entranceway.<br />
<br />
INT. -- WORKSHOP/GARAGE<br />
<br />
The place has been ransacked, turned upside down, but the machine, still hidden in the old beat up looking truck/camper<br />
<br />
is untouched. George ogles it with surprise and delight, remembering it was once his old beat up truck/camper they built the first machine into.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
My old camper! It is, isn't it? I wondered<br />
<br />
where that thing went to.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It sure is.<br />
<br />
Charlie reconnoiters the house.<br />
<br />
INT. -- HALLWAY TO OTHER ROOMS<br />
<br />
Everything has been toppled and turned; some things have been broken. Charlie notices the picture of Ariel and Bryce, also broken, lying in shattered pieces on the phone stand. George enters behind him.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
You know, they'll keep looking until they<br />
<br />
find youâ€”or that machine.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I know.<br />
<br />
Charles walks to a bedroom. George follows.<br />
<br />
INT. -- BEDROOM<br />
<br />
Charles begins rummaging around as George looks on.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
George, the Rover out there.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
We stole it, if that's what you're asking. They're<br />
<br />
pretty easy to grab, if you know what you're doing.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Do you think you could transfer the time<br />
<br />
machine into that?<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Yeah. I think so. Shouldn't be much trick<br />
<br />
to it.<br />
<br />
Charles spots a vanity mirror and gives himself a good once over. Sees his hair a bit disheveled, his beard beginning to grow out.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Got something in mind?<br />
<br />
Charles goes back into the hallway a moment, fetches the picture of Ariel and Bryce, returns to the bedroom, looks again at his reflection in the mirror.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I think I'll clean up a bit before leaving.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
I'll meet you in the garage.<br />
<br />
George exits.<br />
<br />
TIME LAPSE.<br />
<br />
INT. -- BATHROOM<br />
<br />
Charles takes a long, hot, steamy shower.<br />
<br />
MORE TIME LAPSES.<br />
<br />
INT. -- BEDROOM<br />
<br />
A change of clothing, Charles is almost ready. He gives himself one more, thorough, going over in the mirror before he finally takes a razor to his hair and beard.<br />
<br />
MORE TIME LAPSES AS . . .<br />
<br />
a totally new man emerges to stare back at Charles in the mirror. Bald head, a neatly trimmed alternative band type beard on his face. A face even he thinks his mother wouldn't be able to recognize now, Charles has totally transformed himself into a new person.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Looks pretty good on me, too, huh, Bryce?<br />
<br />
Stares at Bryce's picture one last time.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Thanks, whoever the hell you are. I owe<br />
<br />
you big time.<br />
<br />
Charles exits.<br />
<br />
INT. -- WORKSHOP/GARAGE<br />
<br />
George spots Charles with his new look.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Holy, catfish! Look at you! You could be<br />
<br />
Bryce's older brother.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Let's get outa here.<br />
<br />
EXT. OUTSIDE MARTEL/KENYON HOME<br />
<br />
Toting the 5100 computer to the Rover, Charles stashes the computer in the back and climbs into his new wagon. Turning on the engine/machine, he configures his dials for DESTINATION: 2012 A. D., his home at five years of age.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Computer. I want to make a slight change in my<br />
<br />
return destination.--Set coordinates for Acceleron,<br />
<br />
Carter building, time laboratory, Twenty-fifty-six a-d.<br />
<br />
COMPUTER<br />
<br />
Coordinates reset and confirmed for return at<br />
<br />
Acceleron time laboratory, Carter building, twenty-<br />
<br />
fifty-six. a-d. Are you sure you wish to return to<br />
<br />
an abandoned building?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Yes, computer. I'm sure.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
The men say their last goodbyes.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(offers handshake) Thanks for everything, George.<br />
<br />
Thank everyone for me.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Suppose I'll have to go and hotwire another<br />
<br />
Rover now. I was kind of getting' partial<br />
<br />
to this one.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Look on the bright side. You've got your<br />
<br />
old camper back.<br />
<br />
George cracks a solid laugh.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Just get our lives back the way they wereâ€”<br />
<br />
for all of us.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Make it a humvee next time. Those things are damned expensive. See you when I get backâ€”<br />
<br />
in the old timeline.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Okay, computer. Let's get the hell out of<br />
<br />
here.<br />
<br />
As George steps back, Charles reaches for the power button that will take him back in time. The atmosphere around him quickly begins to change, as he begins his transit back again into the past.<br />
<br />
EXT. â€“ KATHRYN MARTEL'S HOME, 2012 A. D. -- DAY<br />
<br />
Kathryn steps outside to take down some washing on the clotheslines. Young Charles, Charlie, at five, is outside in the back yard, running and playing, unawares.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
(calling) Charlie! It's time to go in and<br />
<br />
wash up for dinner.<br />
<br />
The boy continues to play unimpeded.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
(calling again) Charlie! (to self) That boy<br />
<br />
will be the death of me. (calling again)<br />
<br />
Charlie! Go inside and wash up! Now!<br />
<br />
Kathryn suddenly hears a strange noise she recognizes. Dropping her basket, she runs to keep Charlie from seeing.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Charlie. Get into the house now!<br />
<br />
CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Aw, Mom!<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Go!<br />
<br />
Charlie slams the door behind him as the Rover materializes next to her own old, beat up, miles-driven car.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Charlie?â€” What's wrong? I didn't expect you<br />
<br />
back until we. . .Oh, my! (surprised by new look)<br />
<br />
Look at you!<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: Charlie peeks through the screen door, sees his 'Uncle Charles.'<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Where's Charlie?<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
He's in the house washing up for dinner.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I picked up some information while I was back<br />
<br />
in the future. Someone's planning to assassinate<br />
<br />
President Cahill in a couple of days, and I know who<br />
<br />
it is.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
God, no. Charlie. You're talking Thursday night's forum?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I had to come back to stop Sommers.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Good Lord. Trenton Sommers is going to assassinate his own<br />
<br />
. . . Lord, what is this world coming to?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
You still have your plane tickets to Canada? Tell me<br />
<br />
you didn't cash them in for tickets to Nebraska instead.<br />
<br />
Charlie comes running out of the house. Runs into Charles' arms, giving him a great big bear hug.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Uncle Charles, you're back!<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
You know I wouldn't ever leave you for very<br />
<br />
long.<br />
<br />
Charlie fusses over his uncle's new 'haircut.'<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Like the new look?<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Yeah! Neat! How long can you stay?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Don't know, pal. A couple of days maybe.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Could we go see a baseball game while you're here?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
We'll see. But work comes first.<br />
<br />
Charlie climbs down, starts pulling him toward the house.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
I see you got yourself an S-U-V this time.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Yeah. It was such a great deal, I couldn't<br />
<br />
pass it up.<br />
<br />
TIME LAPSE.<br />
<br />
INT. -- DINING TABLE -- EVENING<br />
<br />
Kathryn, Charles, young Charlie dine together. Charlie plays with his food.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I just don't know how you do it, Kathryn.<br />
<br />
(to Charlie) Hey. Are you gonna eat your vegetables<br />
<br />
or are you just gonna let them sit there and get cold?<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Do I have to?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Yes, you have to so you can grow up to be<br />
<br />
big and strong like me.<br />
<br />
KATRHYN<br />
<br />
(anxious) Charles. It's okay for tonight. Charlie,<br />
<br />
honey. Why don't you go watch some<br />
<br />
TV for a while. Your Uncle Charles and I<br />
<br />
have to talk.<br />
<br />
Charlie leaves table.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
See if there's a baseball game listed in<br />
<br />
the paper for tomorrow night and I'll see<br />
<br />
if I can get some tickets.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
All right! (skips away, stops) But, Uncle Charles.<br />
<br />
I can't read yet.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I know. Look for a picture of a baseball<br />
<br />
player with a bat in one of the ads.<br />
<br />
Charlie runs to the living room.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
How do you plan on stopping Trenton Sommers<br />
<br />
from killing President Cahill?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It's not Trenton Sommers. It's his grown son, Rayne<br />
<br />
Sommers who's going to kill Cahill.<br />
<br />
That news reporter, Wilhelmina Jones. Do you<br />
<br />
know where I can find her?<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
That bloodhound? She's been after Cahill<br />
<br />
since his inauguration. She works for<br />
<br />
W-S-G-T T-V. The address should be in the telephone book.<br />
<br />
Do you think she's part of it?<br />
<br />
Charlie comes running back with part of the newspaper.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Here, Uncle Charles.<br />
<br />
Shows Charles the ad he's found, along side a picture of Wilhelmina Jones and Ross Kenyon receiving a television award for their news work.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Speak of the devil.<br />
<br />
INT. -- WSGT â€“ TV STUDIOS NEWSROOM -- NEXT DAY<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina is at her computer working on a story. ROSS KENYON, a good looking, no good, arrogant, money-grubber, lounges at his desk, feet up, reading a newspaper, sipping on a hot cup of coffee. He spots a headline in the BUSINESS SECTION: TIME TRAVEL A REALITY WITHIN YEAR, SAYS ACCELERON PRESIDENT.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
This expose ought to wake a few more people up.<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
And what political faux pa did our illustrious President<br />
<br />
Cahill commit this time?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Stock fraud. Acceleron Corporation. And<br />
<br />
it's not just Cahill. My source tells me<br />
<br />
Trenton Sommers is in on the take, too.<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
(peers out window, unmoved) Looks like it's turning into<br />
<br />
a nice day for an impeachment.<br />
<br />
Or should I say media lynching? (back to<br />
<br />
paper) Which reminds me, don't you have a<br />
<br />
have a press conference scheduled at the<br />
<br />
White House this morning to go to?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
(under breath) Agnes Covington on her way over for a<br />
<br />
little press conference of her own, Ross?<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
You say something?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
(typing away) This president--with all his<br />
<br />
high price flunkies--including Sommersâ€”should<br />
<br />
be impeached. But like you'd care anyway. You<br />
<br />
love power and your high priced cars just as<br />
<br />
much as they do.<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
And just why do you think I bought this television<br />
<br />
station in the first place? Just to show money-<br />
<br />
making reruns?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
(smirking) Well, did you?<br />
<br />
Ross picks up his phone, dials.<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
By the way. I'll be going out of town for a<br />
<br />
few days.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
To hobnob with the rich and famousâ€”as usualâ€”<br />
<br />
I'm just making a guess, of course. (under breath)<br />
<br />
Or should I say one, rich and famous person in<br />
<br />
particular?<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
It pays your salary. (into phone) Yeah, Ben Zuckerman,<br />
<br />
por favor. Tell him it's Ross Kenyon.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Where's Agnes taking you this time, Ross?<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
I told you, it's a business trip.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
To our imaginary affiliate in Aspen, Colorado? Your travel<br />
<br />
agent called yesterday while you were out to lunch.<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
(angry) Agnes Covington happens to be our biggest<br />
<br />
stockholderâ€”AND the lady WE answer toâ€”<br />
<br />
or have you forgotten that little factoid?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
And WE happen to be MARRIED, or have you forgotten to<br />
<br />
tell Ms. Covington that little news bulletin?<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
(in phone)--Ben. It's Rossâ€”You saw this<br />
<br />
morning's Business Section in the paper?<br />
<br />
(to Wilhelmina) We'll discuss this later--when<br />
<br />
I get back. (in phone) Yeah. That's the one.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
(fuming, under breath) I want a baby, Ross, before I'm<br />
<br />
too old to have one. But, I guess, it looks like I<br />
<br />
won't be having one with you anytime soon. Especially<br />
<br />
not after last nightâ€”after you called me Agnes one time<br />
<br />
too many times before we were through. (beat)<br />
<br />
Well. You know what, Ms. Agnes Covington?<br />
<br />
You can have him. Slimy bloodworm. I'll be<br />
<br />
filing for divorce as soon as this press conference is<br />
<br />
over.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina saves story on computer, logs off, grabs pocketbook, steno pad, rises from her desk and heads straight for the door. Ross is still on the phone with his broker.<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
Hey, where are you going?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Press conference. Remember? Don't wait up<br />
<br />
for me.<br />
<br />
ROSS<br />
<br />
(watches Wilhelmina exit, reacts to Ben's<br />
<br />
voice on phone) Yeah, Ben. What's good for<br />
<br />
the goose . . . You got it. Get me all the<br />
<br />
Acceleron stocks you can get your grubby little<br />
<br />
hands on. And while you're at it, buy some for<br />
<br />
yourself, too.<br />
<br />
INT. -- WSGTâ€“TV LOBBY -- DAY<br />
<br />
Charles is at the sign in desk with FRANK, THE DOOR SECURITY GUARD at the studios. It is a huge typical news lobby, dressed in posters and information plaques. Workers, visitors bustle to and fro as Wilhelmina exits an elevator, heads for the exit door.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'm here to see Wilhelmina Jones. I know I<br />
<br />
don't have an appointment. I just got into<br />
<br />
town.<br />
<br />
Overhearing her name, Wilhelmina is intrigued by the handsome stranger asking for her, but approaches cautiously.<br />
<br />
FRANK<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but Ms. Jones isn't . . .<br />
<br />
The guard spots Wilhelmina.<br />
<br />
FRANK<br />
<br />
Ms. Jones.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
It's okay, Frank. (offers hand) I'm<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina Jones. Most people around here<br />
<br />
call me W-J. What can I do for youâ€”Mister<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Martel. Charles Martel. Most people call<br />
<br />
me Charlie.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Okay, Charlie Martel. You're sure it isn't something<br />
<br />
more descriptive of your looksâ€”<br />
<br />
like Slash or Captain Blood, the Bone-crusher<br />
<br />
or Al, my cameraman?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Oh, the new do. I'm experimenting.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Well, whatever, it seems to be working. I'm intrigued.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
You know, I think I like you already.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina takes Charles by the arm.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I have a press conference to attend. Walk me<br />
<br />
to my car? We can talk.<br />
<br />
They exit together.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- WSGT-TV PARKING LOT -- DAY<br />
<br />
As they head toward Wilhelmina's car . . .<br />
<br />
CAMERA CUTS TO:<br />
<br />
ONE OF SOMMERS' SECURITY GUARDS ON WALKIE TALKIE BY A LIMOSINE parked nearby. Rayne Sommers sits in the limo awaiting word.<br />
<br />
VOICE ON WALKIE TALKIE<br />
<br />
She just left the building.<br />
<br />
SOMMERS' GUARD<br />
<br />
I see her. She's with someone.<br />
<br />
VOICE ON WALKIE TALKIE<br />
<br />
Looks like her cameraman.<br />
<br />
SOMMERS' GUARD<br />
<br />
There's no sign of Martel.<br />
<br />
VOICE ON WALKIE TALKIE<br />
<br />
That's a negative here, too.<br />
<br />
SOMMERS' GUARD<br />
<br />
We'll keep looking. Over and out.<br />
<br />
Sommers looks quite disappointed.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
I was sure Martel would have tried to<br />
<br />
contact her by now.<br />
<br />
SOMMERS' GUARD<br />
<br />
Maybe he's still not here.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
Oh, he's here, all right. I can smell him.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
I'm late for the press conference. (closes car window)<br />
<br />
SOMMERS'GUARD<br />
<br />
(into walkie talkie again) We're heading<br />
<br />
for the White House. Keep your eyes open.<br />
<br />
Martel may have decided to try to get to<br />
<br />
Cahill on his own first. (Puts walkie<br />
<br />
talkie away. To limo driver on other side<br />
<br />
of car) Let's go.<br />
<br />
Guard, limo driver get in. They leave.<br />
<br />
CUT BACK TO:<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina, Charles by her car. She opens door to get in.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
So, Mr. Martelâ€”Charlie. What's your story<br />
<br />
you couldn't wait to see me about?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
A friend of mine told me you could help me.<br />
<br />
There's going to be an attempt on the<br />
<br />
president's life--at the forum scheduled<br />
<br />
in La Fayette Park two days from now. I'm<br />
<br />
here to try and stop it.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Whoa. Wait a minute. And just how do you<br />
<br />
know someone's going to try to assassinate<br />
<br />
President Cahill?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I just know. That's all I can tell youâ€”<br />
<br />
for now.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You're not an FBI, are you, looking for some terrorists<br />
<br />
plotting this deed? I don't do FBI. And I certainly<br />
<br />
don't involve myself in any criminal activity that involves<br />
<br />
possible assassination attempts on political leaders.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'm not FBI. And I'm not a copâ€”and I'm not<br />
<br />
here to kill Cahill myself--if that was your<br />
<br />
next question.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Really? With those looks, honey? I think<br />
<br />
you'd better start proving something to me<br />
<br />
quick or you can kiss your ride to the White House<br />
<br />
goodbye.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Look. I'm just a concerned citizen . . .<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Who just happens to have some kind of inside information<br />
<br />
--on a possible assassination attempt on President Cahill.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Look. I'm telling you the truth. Whether<br />
<br />
you believe me or not . . . whether you<br />
<br />
help me or not, it's going to happen.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
And just what makes you think I'd help you<br />
<br />
stop a bullet meant for that worse than a poor excuse<br />
<br />
for a world leader anyway, Mr. Martel? Everyone<br />
<br />
around here knows there's been no love loss between us<br />
<br />
since day one. And for all I know, YOU could be the<br />
<br />
one who's going to pump that silver bullet into Cahill.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Because--if you don'tâ€”help me stop Cahill's assassination<br />
<br />
--you and your cameraman, Al, is that his name, will be<br />
<br />
killed in the crossfire at that forum as well.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina shivers from the foreboding news.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Who are you--really?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Someone who needs you to get me close enough<br />
<br />
to Cahill to stop his assassination--and you<br />
<br />
and Al from being killed. I'll tell you what<br />
<br />
you need to know. Just get me to Cahill.<br />
<br />
Or, at least, just near enough to warn him.<br />
<br />
Silenced, Wilhelmina looks around, like she's in a daze. She spots some unsavory looking men she's unable to recognize who hanging around the TV Studios parking lot. For the moment,<br />
<br />
the men aren't much paying attention, as she points them out<br />
<br />
to Charles.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Do you see those men?<br />
<br />
They look very much like Sommers' men from the alternate future to Charles.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Do you know who they are?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Yeahâ€”I do. We gotta get out of here before<br />
<br />
they catch on that I'm who they're looking<br />
<br />
for.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I know a place where we can be safeâ€”and talk<br />
<br />
more about this assassination attemptâ€”after<br />
<br />
the press conference.<br />
<br />
They pile into Wilhelmina's car, peel out of the parking lot. The men, are still reconnoitering the area. They spot Wilhelmina's car hightailing it away from the studios. One gets into his car and proceeds to follow.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- IN CAR/ON ROUTE TO WHITE HOUSE<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina's on her cell phone with Al.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Al.--I think I just got us a mega man bites<br />
<br />
dog story.--Where do you think I am? On my<br />
<br />
way to sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue.<br />
<br />
--Bring your reporter credentials. I'm going<br />
<br />
to need your cameraman pass for the man with<br />
<br />
the story. (hangs up). Sometimes Al doubles<br />
<br />
as a reporter.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
And you can just show up with anytime with anyone?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
They never check too closely when they see<br />
<br />
me coming. They know I'm legit. Besides,<br />
<br />
what would Cahill's presidency be without a<br />
<br />
little poke and jab now and then from their<br />
<br />
favorite, roving reporter?<br />
<br />
CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Now that you mention it, I do seem to recall watching<br />
<br />
some of your better work on TV<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
The secret servicemen absolutely love me.<br />
<br />
They have a file on me this thick, and<br />
<br />
they're ready and willing to use it<br />
<br />
anytime.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'm sure they are. (beat) George was right.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
George?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
That friend of mineâ€”who said if anyone could<br />
<br />
get me near President Cahill, you could.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, right. Smart man--your friend.<br />
<br />
Tell me again you're not just using me<br />
<br />
to further your own agenda.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Moi? Surely you jest. Although, if I<br />
<br />
wasn't already engaged, I might . . .<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You had better be telling the truth, Mr.<br />
<br />
Martel. I'd like to live just a little<br />
<br />
while longer in this cold and heartless<br />
<br />
world, thank you very much.â€”And, aren't<br />
<br />
you just a little too old for me anyway?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
You can take what I said to the bank.<br />
<br />
Guaranteed.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
That's good to know, Mr. Charlie Martel.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
You, know, I think I'm beginning to like<br />
<br />
you.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
That's a relief. I was worried there for<br />
<br />
a second.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
And I have this feeling we're going to<br />
<br />
get along better than great.<br />
<br />
As they pull into the security area of the White House, A WHITE HOUSE SECURITY GUARD stops them and checks out Wilhelmina's credentials, Al's card, and lets them pass through.<br />
<br />
INT. THE WHITE HOUSE, LIBRARY AND STUDY NEAR PORTICO -- DAY<br />
<br />
Senator Jackson Stryker, A.K.A. Rayne Sommers, arrives with his entourage. Sommers, as Stryker, enters the study, shake hands with Cahill. Trenton Sommers is already in the study along with his 12 year-old son, RAYNE, Rayne Sommers as a boy. Young Rayne is otherwise by himself, feeling very alone and melancholy. He's at one of Cahill's game tables looking like he is studying possible chess moves in the current game he plays with an unknown person. In reality, he is reliving/rehearing in his head the angry voices exchanged in an earlier conversation with, and beating from, his father.<br />
<br />
FLASHBACK<br />
<br />
SOUND: SOLID SMACKING ON A CHILD'S BODY.<br />
<br />
TRENTON SOMMERS' VOICE<br />
<br />
You little brat! Don't you EVER talk back<br />
<br />
like that to me ever again! You hear me?<br />
<br />
I'm your father, damn it! And you'll obey<br />
<br />
me! You're just like your bitch of a mother.<br />
<br />
Stubborn, willful. A complete embarrassment<br />
<br />
to me in Washington!<br />
<br />
END FLASHBACK<br />
<br />
As Rayne enters and spots himself at the game table, he lingers over the sight of the boy/himself. It's almost as if he is also hearing, seeing, feeling what the boy is thinking at this very moment.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
(awakening Rayne to his voice)<br />
<br />
Senator, I was hoping you'd be able to<br />
<br />
Make it. Are things better at home?<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Much. Thank you for asking.<br />
<br />
Trenton gives Rayne a 'look' and removes himself to the portico as Cahill continues to greet his other arriving guests. Rayne, alone now for the moment, approaches the boy, still hard at working studying the chessboard. A SERVANT interrupts momentarily, to offer Rayne a drink.<br />
<br />
TV CREWMAN<br />
<br />
(enters study from portico)<br />
<br />
We're almost ready, Mr. President.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
Thank you. (to Rayne) Please, make yourself<br />
<br />
comfortable. We'll be starting shortly.<br />
<br />
Cahill leaves to attend to other matters. Rayne cautiously sits at the table with the boy, studying the chessboard a moment himself.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
You know, you can take your opponent's<br />
<br />
bishop.<br />
<br />
YOUNG RAYNE<br />
<br />
But then that would leave my king<br />
<br />
vulnerable.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
True. But if you notice, in the next two<br />
<br />
moves, you could take his queen and win<br />
<br />
the gameâ€”checkmate.<br />
<br />
YOUNG RAYNE<br />
<br />
Yeah. Thanksâ€”Mister . . .<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Senator--Stryker. (moves a piece) You know,<br />
<br />
often times certainâ€”larger--sacrifices are<br />
<br />
needed in order to obtain a desired goalâ€”a<br />
<br />
goal that is even greater than the one we<br />
<br />
are about to sacrifice.<br />
<br />
YOUNG RAYNE<br />
<br />
Do you play chess with my Dad, too? (sad)<br />
<br />
He makes me play all the time.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Think of it as a stern life lesson that<br />
<br />
could well serve you one day.<br />
<br />
YOUNG RAYNE<br />
<br />
I've had enough of those for one day.<br />
<br />
(getting up) I don't wanna play anymore.<br />
<br />
I hate chess. I hate HIM.<br />
<br />
Young Rayne flips the game board over, scattering the chess pieces across the floor. A servant immediately comes to pick them up as the older Rayne tries to reach out and comfort the younger Rayne, but the boy flinches, revealing wounds he is suffering from hidden under his clothing. The older Rayne remembers and relives the pain his father inflicted upon him. It makes him also remember Oliver's cruel words to him, too, before he began this venture: 'Father was right . . .'<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
One day, Rayne, I promise you, you will<br />
<br />
not only have your father groveling at your<br />
<br />
feet and begging for your forgiveness, the<br />
<br />
entire world will be bowing down before you.<br />
<br />
The power of the universe at your command,<br />
<br />
with one stroke of your pen you will be able<br />
<br />
to crush small, smarmy little men like<br />
<br />
your father. Small minded, no heart, cruel<br />
<br />
in their love. You will bury them deep in<br />
<br />
their graves like the worthless little<br />
<br />
rodents they are.<br />
<br />
Young Rayne trods to the hallway and up the winding stairway as the older Rayne speaks words of encouragement to himself under his breath.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Savor this moment, young Rayne. You don't<br />
<br />
know it yet, but this day is your beginning.<br />
<br />
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Charles working on setting camera cables in the study. He sees young Rayne, too, climbing the stairs. He has heard every word Rayne has spoken. The older Rayne hasn't been paying much attention elsewhere or to the camera crews setting up for the conference. Wilhelmina, Al enter the study from the portico trying to get a statement from the president/vice-president, who enter before them.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Mr. President, has Russia made any attempts<br />
<br />
to stop China's invasion of North Korea on<br />
<br />
your behalf?<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
Ms. Jones. That will all be addressed in my<br />
<br />
statements. Now, if you will excuse me. (to Rayne)<br />
<br />
Senator Stryker. It's time.<br />
<br />
Hearing his pseudonym, Rayne rejoins them. Cahill steps back out onto the portico, as Charles keeps a watchful eye over both the Raynesâ€”and the heads of state.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
(with Rayne, spots servant still picking up<br />
<br />
the chess pieces)<br />
<br />
Senator, I see you've been entertaining my<br />
<br />
son.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Yes. But I'm afraid I may have lost you your game.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
He does have a temper, that one. Now my other son,<br />
<br />
Oliver, he's the exact opposite of Rayne.<br />
<br />
They exit the portico together.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- PORTICO OF THE WHITE HOUSE -- DAY<br />
<br />
Cahill stands at the podium, cameramen and reporters gather round, as Trenton, Rayne as Stryker join Cahill. Flashbulbs begin popping as the press conference begins.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
(to Sommers, Jackson/Rayne, press)<br />
<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a sad day, to<br />
<br />
be sure.<br />
<br />
INT. -- WHITE HOUSE LIBRARY/STUDY<br />
<br />
Charles, pretending to work, remains fixed, watching the men, the crowd surrounding the portico.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- PORTICO OF THE WHITE HOUSE<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
I have been informed by my sources that just<br />
<br />
a few hours ago China's army crossed the<br />
<br />
borders into North Korea taking several government<br />
<br />
officials hostage in both the north and the south.<br />
<br />
Russia, as well as several other members of the<br />
<br />
United Nations and NATO have declared a state of<br />
<br />
emergency.<br />
<br />
NEWS REPORTER'S VOICE IN CROWD<br />
<br />
In response this obviously unprovoked attack,<br />
<br />
has the United States decided to declare war<br />
<br />
on China, Sir?<br />
<br />
More news personnel press in clamoring, (as well as Wilhelmina and her cameraman, Al) trying to get a statement from the president.<br />
<br />
INT. -- RESTAURANT -- EVENING<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina and Charles are enjoying dinner at a local, favorite restaurant. Charles is working on a salad and broiled fish as Wilhelmina wolfs down a steak, washing it down with a large glass of red wine.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Wow. Can you imagine. World War three's<br />
<br />
practically knocking down the door.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It was inevitable.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
China did warn us--a long time ago-- they<br />
<br />
were going to annex Koreaâ€”both Koreas--one<br />
<br />
way or the other. Who will be next? Japan?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'd tell you the United States will be nuked. But I<br />
<br />
don't want to scare you.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Scare me?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I think you'll find Taiwan will be first on<br />
<br />
their list of territories before they decide<br />
<br />
to invade Japan.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
My aren't we just full of the expertise on Far East<br />
<br />
politics tonight.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
History WAS my favorite subject in schoolâ€”<br />
<br />
even though I didn't do very well on the<br />
<br />
testsâ€”according to my mother.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
But this is stuff that hasn't even happened<br />
<br />
yet. Don't tell me you're the reincarnation<br />
<br />
of Nostradamus and you can read crystal balls.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Something like that.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Hmm.--I was weaned on ESPN before Ross hired<br />
<br />
me. Didn't know much about either sports or history<br />
<br />
until then.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Sports can be like a war between nations. In fact, that's<br />
<br />
how the ancients sometimes used to settle their disputes<br />
<br />
between nations, mano a mano between their best guys.<br />
<br />
How's that for knowing history.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
War. Is that all this world can ever think about?<br />
<br />
You'd think they'd get tired of killing each other off<br />
<br />
after awhile.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Could you pass me the salt, please?<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina gives him the salt-shaker amazed at his indifference.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You're not just a little bit concerned we<br />
<br />
could be going to war with China any second?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
We still have a few hours left. And we do have to eat.<br />
<br />
Could you hand me the bread, too, please?<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina hands him the bread, still amazed.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
So, what can you tell me about Jackson<br />
<br />
Stryker?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Ah, so you did notice our illustrious Foreign<br />
<br />
Relations Senator at the press conference.<br />
<br />
Some emergency back home, wherever that was,<br />
<br />
caught him off guard and kept him out of Washington<br />
<br />
for a few days.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'll just bet I can guess what that was.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
There's really not that much I can tell you<br />
<br />
right now, to tell you the truth. He hasn't<br />
<br />
been on the political scene all that long.<br />
<br />
It's his first term in office as a U-S<br />
<br />
senator, although, I understand he did serve<br />
<br />
as senator in his home state before coming to<br />
<br />
Washington. I also know from the Capitol Hill<br />
<br />
grapevineâ€”rumor has it he can't stand Sommers.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
From what I saw today between the two of them, that's<br />
<br />
really surprising to hear. Stryker was rather quite<br />
<br />
chummy with the V-P's son before the conference began.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Now there's a strange duck.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Who, Stryker?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Sommers' son. I've never seen him around<br />
<br />
other kids. Keeps to himself a lot. Won't<br />
<br />
let anybody touch himâ€”especially his father<br />
<br />
--in public.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I dare say, you wouldn't either, if you saw<br />
<br />
what I saw this morning.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You think Sommers beats on his kid, too?<br />
<br />
There've been more than enough rumors to go around<br />
<br />
Washington.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
What about Cahill?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Oh, the two of them get along, all right.<br />
<br />
They have to. Rumor also has it Cahill wants<br />
<br />
to dump Sommers next election. That's what Thursday<br />
<br />
night's forum is all about. But<br />
<br />
Sommers is counting on running after Cahill,<br />
<br />
so he's doing everything he can to prevent that.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, that WAS strange Stryker, talking<br />
<br />
to Sommers' kid today like they were best buds or<br />
<br />
something.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Maybe the kidâ€”reminded Stryker of himself a<br />
<br />
little--and vice versa.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
No, that's not it. Trenton Sommers never<br />
<br />
allows anyone anywhere near his kidâ€”unless<br />
<br />
--the rumor really is true and he needs to squelch<br />
<br />
it before it ruins his presidential aspirations.<br />
<br />
It's been going around for<br />
<br />
some time now, he beats on his kid regularly.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
And no one's ever been able to prove it?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
When it comes to Executive Branch shenanigans,<br />
<br />
is there anything that can really be proven?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Do I detect a hint of cynicism in that top</div>

<br />
Wow. Can you imagine. World War three's<br />
<br />
practically knocking down the door.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It was inevitable.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
China did warn us--a long time ago-- they<br />
<br />
were going to annex Koreaâ€”both Koreas--one<br />
<br />
way or the other. Who will be next? Japan?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'd tell you the United States will be nuked. But I<br />
<br />
don't want to scare you.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Scare me?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I think you'll find Taiwan will be first on<br />
<br />
their list of territories before they decide<br />
<br />
to invade Japan.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
My aren't we just full of the expertise on Far East<br />
<br />
politics tonight.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
History WAS my favorite subject in schoolâ€”<br />
<br />
even though I didn't do very well on the<br />
<br />
testsâ€”according to my mother.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
But this is stuff that hasn't even happened<br />
<br />
yet. Don't tell me you're the reincarnation<br />
<br />
of Nostradamus and you can read crystal balls.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Something like that.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Hmm.--I was weaned on ESPN before Ross hired<br />
<br />
me. Didn't know much about either sports or history<br />
<br />
until then.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Sports can be like a war between nations. In fact, that's<br />
<br />
how the ancients sometimes used to settle their disputes<br />
<br />
between nations, mano a mano between their best guys.<br />
<br />
How's that for knowing history.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
War. Is that all this world can ever think about?<br />
<br />
You'd think they'd get tired of killing each other off<br />
<br />
after awhile.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Could you pass me the salt, please?<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina gives him the salt-shaker amazed at his indifference.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You're not just a little bit concerned we<br />
<br />
could be going to war with China any second?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
We still have a few hours left. And we do have to eat.<br />
<br />
Could you hand me the bread, too, please?<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina hands him the bread, still amazed.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
So, what can you tell me about Jackson<br />
<br />
Stryker?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Ah, so you did notice our illustrious Foreign<br />
<br />
Relations Senator at the press conference.<br />
<br />
Some emergency back home, wherever that was,<br />
<br />
caught him off guard and kept him out of Washington<br />
<br />
for a few days.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'll just bet I can guess what that was.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
There's really not that much I can tell you<br />
<br />
right now, to tell you the truth. He hasn't<br />
<br />
been on the political scene all that long.<br />
<br />
It's his first term in office as a U-S<br />
<br />
senator, although, I understand he did serve<br />
<br />
as senator in his home state before coming to<br />
<br />
Washington. I also know from the Capitol Hill<br />
<br />
grapevineâ€”rumor has it he can't stand Sommers.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
From what I saw today between the two of them, that's<br />
<br />
really surprising to hear. Stryker was rather quite<br />
<br />
chummy with the V-P's son before the conference began.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Now there's a strange duck.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Who, Stryker?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Sommers' son. I've never seen him around<br />
<br />
other kids. Keeps to himself a lot. Won't<br />
<br />
let anybody touch himâ€”especially his father<br />
<br />
--in public.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I dare say, you wouldn't either, if you saw<br />
<br />
what I saw this morning.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You think Sommers beats on his kid, too?<br />
<br />
There've been more than enough rumors to go around<br />
<br />
Washington.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
What about Cahill?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Oh, the two of them get along, all right.<br />
<br />
They have to. Rumor also has it Cahill wants<br />
<br />
to dump Sommers next election. That's what Thursday<br />
<br />
night's forum is all about. But<br />
<br />
Sommers is counting on running after Cahill,<br />
<br />
so he's doing everything he can to prevent that.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, that WAS strange Stryker, talking<br />
<br />
to Sommers' kid today like they were best buds or<br />
<br />
something.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Maybe the kidâ€”reminded Stryker of himself a<br />
<br />
little--and vice versa.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
No, that's not it. Trenton Sommers never<br />
<br />
allows anyone anywhere near his kidâ€”unless<br />
<br />
--the rumor really is true and he needs to squelch<br />
<br />
it before it ruins his presidential aspirations.<br />
<br />
It's been going around for<br />
<br />
some time now, he beats on his kid regularly.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
And no one's ever been able to prove it?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
When it comes to Executive Branch shenanigans,<br />
<br />
is there anything that can really be proven?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Do I detect a hint of cynicism in that top<br />
<br />
notch TV reporter voice of yours? And in one<br />
<br />
so young, too.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Believe me, after working the Washington beat<br />
<br />
a few years anyone, young or old, can become<br />
<br />
the devoutist of cynics.â€”And I'm not that<br />
<br />
young.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Well, if it's any consolation, rumor has it if anyone<br />
<br />
can prove Sommers regularly beats the crap out of his kid,<br />
<br />
you'd be the one Washington would put its money on to find<br />
<br />
the evidence.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Gee, thanks, I think, for the vote of<br />
<br />
confidence. (sees wine glass empty) I could use some<br />
<br />
more wine. How about you? (hailing) Waiter!<br />
<br />
INT. -- WHITE HOUSE/STATE DINING HALL -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
President Cahill hosts a state dinner for many foreign dignitaries in light of the events taking place. Congressional leaders attend as well as Vice-President Trenton Sommers and Senator Jackson Stryker (Rayne Sommers). Food and wine flow as servants hover.<br />
<br />
UGANDAN AMBASSADOR<br />
<br />
Mr. President, rumors are circulating around<br />
<br />
our Embassy--your forum will not be so peaceful in<br />
<br />
light of your announcement today.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
There will always be protestors, Madam<br />
<br />
Ambassador. Lord knows my first four years<br />
<br />
have seen their fair share. It's really a<br />
<br />
matter of how one handles the dissenters.<br />
<br />
UGANDAN AMBASSADOR<br />
<br />
That makes for an evening of pleasant dialog<br />
<br />
and discussion--or arrests and convictions?<br />
<br />
Those surrounding the ambassador and president laugh, all except for one woman U.S. senator.<br />
<br />
WOMAN SENATOR<br />
<br />
(to a male senator sitting nearby)<br />
<br />
I take it the president hasn't heard the<br />
<br />
latest results in the straw polls?<br />
<br />
MALE SENATOR<br />
<br />
Who pays attention to voters' opinions<br />
<br />
anymore? Certainly not Cahill or Sommers.<br />
<br />
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR<br />
<br />
We Russians haven't had to worry about<br />
<br />
elections now for over four years since<br />
<br />
Putin's dissolution of our parliament.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
And as it should beâ€”in all democratic governments.<br />
<br />
Everyone laughs again, except for the woman senator and her companion.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
(raises wine glass) A toast, Mr. Ambassador?<br />
<br />
As they drink . . .<br />
<br />
CUT TO: JACKSON/RAYNE, TRENTON SOMMERS sitting together, eating, quietly talking.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Smug son of a bitch, isn't he?<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
With a crisis on our hands that could send us hurling into<br />
<br />
World War three just by the way he looked at Chairman Yang.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Is everything set for Thursday night?<br />
<br />
SOUND: JACKSON/RAYNE'S CELL PHONE GOES OFF. He has a text message from Prescott:<br />
<br />
REBEL LEADER LOCATED. WITHIN HOURS OF CAPTURE. BUT SITUATION HERE DESTABILIZING RAPIDLY. MAY HAVE TO RETURN BEFORE FORUM TOMORROW NIGHT.<br />
<br />
Re-pockets phone as if nothing's wrong.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
Is everything all right?<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Just a few minor loose ends at home I<br />
<br />
still have to clean up. Nothing to worry<br />
<br />
about.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
The 'protestors' have been paidâ€”handsomely,<br />
<br />
I might add. My operators assure me we will<br />
<br />
be getting our money's worth before the<br />
<br />
evening's over.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Good.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
You know this goes against everything we're supposed to<br />
<br />
stand for.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
And who says this isn't what our country stands for? Helping<br />
<br />
the voters rid themselves of slithering little tin gods like<br />
<br />
Cahill before election day? You do want to be president of<br />
<br />
the United States after Cahill . . .<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
I just never thought I'd be helping someone assassinate a<br />
<br />
president of the United States in order to be the President<br />
<br />
of the United States.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Keep your mouth shut, you imbecile, before the whole world hears<br />
<br />
what we're planning.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
You are sure this is what the future holdsâ€”for both you and me?<br />
<br />
How do I know I can I trust you're really from the futureâ€”and<br />
<br />
you're not just making this all up to grab power for yourself?<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Oh, there will be power gained for myself in<br />
<br />
this transaction--eventually. Make no mistake about<br />
<br />
that--in the year 2036 as a bona fide<br />
<br />
U.S. Congressman--under President Trenton Sommers' sixth<br />
<br />
term in office. Come to my office tomorrow and I will<br />
<br />
give you more than all the proof you will ever need. I<br />
<br />
will take you into the future myself.<br />
<br />
Cahill interrupts the two men's conversation. A dark haired, dark eyed French beauty clings to his armâ€”looking very much like Ariel Du Bois. She is FRANCESCA DU BOIS, a high priced prostitute disguised as an international newspaper reporter.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
Senator Stryker. I have someone I'd like you<br />
<br />
to meet. Madamemoiselle Francesca Du Bois, political<br />
<br />
correspondent for Le Monde.<br />
<br />
FRANCESCA<br />
<br />
Senator Stryker. I've heard so much about<br />
<br />
you. It is a pleasure to finally meet you.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
One of the more pleasant amenities from<br />
<br />
Europe.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
(kisses hand, eyes her hungrily) Enchante,<br />
<br />
Madamoiselle Du Bois.<br />
<br />
FRANCESCA<br />
<br />
Perhaps, Senator, later on you could honor<br />
<br />
me with an interview?<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
If this your way of getting me to vote 'yes'<br />
<br />
for the war, Mr. President . . .<br />
<br />
Some laughter ensues, but not from the president.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
(notices Rayne's tacit approval) Everything,<br />
<br />
I take it then, is to you--satisfaction, gentlemen?<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Very much so, Mr. President.<br />
<br />
Cahill leaves, Francesca still on his arm.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- RESTAURANT -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina and Charles exit the restaurant together, head for her car.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
We can pick up your car tomorrow.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It's my mother's car. She lets me use it whenever<br />
<br />
I'm in town.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Ah, still another mystery solved. The gentle-<br />
<br />
man doesn't own his own car. Or does he?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Oh, I have a car all right. It's just--out of commission<br />
<br />
right now.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
(opens car door) Likely story. You just don't want to<br />
<br />
put a lot of miles yet on brand new tires. Men. You're<br />
<br />
all alike.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Something like that.<br />
<br />
They get in, drive off.<br />
<br />
INT. -- WHITE HOUSE STATE DINING HALL<br />
<br />
Jackson/Rayne and Trenton still deep in conversation.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
Why do you always have to act like your best<br />
<br />
friends with him?<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
One hand continually washes the other in<br />
<br />
order to get things done in this business.<br />
<br />
Or has politics taught you nothing in<br />
<br />
dealing with your enemies?<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
Cahill deserves what he's going to get.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
I am sure, no less than you.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
You're certain Cahill will be killed and<br />
<br />
I will become the next president of the<br />
<br />
United States?<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
If all goes to plan, it will ensure a dynasty<br />
<br />
for the Sommers men--if you don't kill your<br />
<br />
son first.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
I do hope you're talking about my youngest<br />
<br />
son, Oliver, and not that addle brained<br />
<br />
mamma's boy, Rayne.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Speaking of your first born, I saw a new face<br />
<br />
in the media crowd today with that Jones woman,<br />
<br />
working in the study when I was with Rayne.<br />
<br />
He'll need to be checked out.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
(grabbing cell phone, dialing) I'll get right<br />
<br />
on it. (into phone) Chief of Security . . .<br />
<br />
INT. -- ROSS KENYON'S CONDO/LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
Charles, Wilhelmina enter. Wilhelmina turns on the lights and heads for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
There's a bottle of wine in the frig.<br />
<br />
Glasses in the cupboard. I won't be long.<br />
<br />
As Charles retrieves the bottle of wine, opens it as Wilhelmina enters the bathroom.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
You're sure your boss won't mind my using<br />
<br />
his digs for a couple of days.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
He has guests staying here all the time.<br />
<br />
Besides, he's in Aspen right now, with a<br />
<br />
certain Agnes Covington . . .<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(reacting to the name) Did you say Agnes Covington?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You know her?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Yeah, you could say I do, yeah. (spots a CD player)<br />
<br />
Do you mind if I put some music on?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Help yourself. I'll just be a couple more minutes.<br />
<br />
INT. -- BATHROOM<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina sadly looks at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
FLASHBACK: and recalls her argument with Ross earlier at the station, how it ended.<br />
<br />
END FLASHBACK.<br />
<br />
SOUND: THE ALARM ON HER WATCH GOES OFF, reminding her to take her medication. She takes her case of her birth control pills out of her handbag and reaches for a pill. Then stops, thinking a moment on it, about Charles and what an encounter with him could mean for her. Throwing caution to the wind, she opens her birth control pill case, drops the entire package of pills into the toilet, flushes it down, and leaves the bathroom.<br />
<br />
INT. -- LIVING ROOM<br />
<br />
As quiet music plays in the background, Wilhelmina grabs her wine, cozies up to Charles, preparing for her one night stand.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
So. Tell me a little bit about yourself.<br />
<br />
Your story. And how I'm going to die.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
There isn't that much to tell. If<br />
<br />
everything goes to plan, you won't die.<br />
<br />
She spots his silver-coated St. Christopher's medallion, begins playing with it.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
No? That's good to hear. You must be very religious<br />
<br />
because--wasn't St. Christopher kicked out of sainthoodâ€”<br />
<br />
or are you a man who just likes to wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
Charles takes necklace off, gives it to Wilhelmina.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Old mother's superstition. Here. It'll<br />
<br />
look much better on you.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina puts it on, continues seduction.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I think my luck is beginning to change<br />
<br />
alreadyâ€”if I'm going to travel in the<br />
<br />
next day or two.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(persuaded towards having sex with her)<br />
<br />
You feel it--too?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You might say that. (long pause) You say<br />
<br />
you're here because you know of a possible<br />
<br />
assassination attempt on the president's<br />
<br />
lifeâ€”yet there isn't that much to tell<br />
<br />
about who you are or where you come from.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I guess you could say that makes me a man<br />
<br />
of mystery.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
And me a hard-assed reporter, Mr. Martel, who<br />
<br />
can smell a story miles away. You'll have to<br />
<br />
do much better than that. Much better before<br />
<br />
--I back off. â€”Ooh, I love this tune. It's my<br />
<br />
favorite. Would you care to dance?<br />
<br />
They begin to slow dance as the tune plays.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Okay. So, when should start expecting<br />
<br />
the third degree?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You have a woman waiting for you back home?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Whoa. Wait. Back up for a second. Let me<br />
<br />
rephrase that question. So, when should I<br />
<br />
start expecting the personal third degree?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Isn't that what interrogating a suspect is supposed<br />
<br />
to be all about?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I was expecting more of a question like:<br />
<br />
are you the one who's planning to assassinate<br />
<br />
the president?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
(seductively) Well--are you?<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
If I didn't know any better, I'd think you<br />
<br />
were trying to seduce me.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Would that really be so bad if I was?<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(sobering, sad) No. I guess not. Not<br />
<br />
anymore.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Oh?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It's nothing like that. My fiancâ€”back<br />
<br />
home--was murdered. And it all ties<br />
<br />
somehow into this possible assassination.<br />
<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">INT. -- WHITE HOUSE/STATE DINING HALL -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
President Cahill hosts a state dinner for many foreign dignitaries in light of the events taking place. Congressional leaders attend as well as Vice-President Trenton Sommers and Senator Jackson Stryker (Rayne Sommers). Food and wine flow as servants hover.<br />
<br />
UGANDAN AMBASSADOR<br />
<br />
Mr. President, rumors are circulating around<br />
<br />
our Embassy--your forum will not be so peaceful in<br />
<br />
light of your announcement today.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
There will always be protestors, Madam<br />
<br />
Ambassador. Lord knows my first four years<br />
<br />
have seen their fair share. It's really a<br />
<br />
matter of how one handles the dissenters.<br />
<br />
UGANDAN AMBASSADOR<br />
<br />
That makes for an evening of pleasant dialog<br />
<br />
and discussion--or arrests and convictions?<br />
<br />
Those surrounding the ambassador and president laugh, all except for one woman U.S. senator.<br />
<br />
WOMAN SENATOR<br />
<br />
(to a male senator sitting nearby)<br />
<br />
I take it the president hasn't heard the<br />
<br />
latest results in the straw polls?<br />
<br />
MALE SENATOR<br />
<br />
Who pays attention to voters' opinions<br />
<br />
anymore? Certainly not Cahill or Sommers.<br />
<br />
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR<br />
<br />
We Russians haven't had to worry about<br />
<br />
elections now for over four years since<br />
<br />
Putin's dissolution of our parliament.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
And as it should beâ€”in all democratic governments.<br />
<br />
Everyone laughs again, except for the woman senator and her companion.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
(raises wine glass) A toast, Mr. Ambassador?<br />
<br />
As they drink . . .<br />
<br />
CUT TO: JACKSON/RAYNE, TRENTON SOMMERS sitting together, eating, quietly talking.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Smug son of a bitch, isn't he?<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
With a crisis on our hands that could send us hurling into<br />
<br />
World War three just by the way he looked at Chairman Yang.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Is everything set for Thursday night?<br />
<br />
SOUND: JACKSON/RAYNE'S CELL PHONE GOES OFF. He has a text message from Prescott:<br />
<br />
REBEL LEADER LOCATED. WITHIN HOURS OF CAPTURE. BUT SITUATION HERE DESTABILIZING RAPIDLY. MAY HAVE TO RETURN BEFORE FORUM TOMORROW NIGHT.<br />
<br />
Re-pockets phone as if nothing's wrong.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
Is everything all right?<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Just a few minor loose ends at home I<br />
<br />
still have to clean up. Nothing to worry<br />
<br />
about.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
The 'protestors' have been paidâ€”handsomely,<br />
<br />
I might add. My operators assure me we will<br />
<br />
be getting our money's worth before the<br />
<br />
evening's over.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Good.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
You know this goes against everything we're supposed to<br />
<br />
stand for.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
And who says this isn't what our country stands for? Helping<br />
<br />
the voters rid themselves of slithering little tin gods like<br />
<br />
Cahill before election day? You do want to be president of<br />
<br />
the United States after Cahill . . .<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
I just never thought I'd be helping someone assassinate a<br />
<br />
president of the United States in order to be the President<br />
<br />
of the United States.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Keep your mouth shut, you imbecile, before the whole world hears<br />
<br />
what we're planning.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
You are sure this is what the future holdsâ€”for both you and me?<br />
<br />
How do I know I can I trust you're really from the futureâ€”and<br />
<br />
you're not just making this all up to grab power for yourself?<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Oh, there will be power gained for myself in<br />
<br />
this transaction--eventually. Make no mistake about<br />
<br />
that--in the year 2036 as a bona fide<br />
<br />
U.S. Congressman--under President Trenton Sommers' sixth<br />
<br />
term in office. Come to my office tomorrow and I will<br />
<br />
give you more than all the proof you will ever need. I<br />
<br />
will take you into the future myself.<br />
<br />
Cahill interrupts the two men's conversation. A dark haired, dark eyed French beauty clings to his armâ€”looking very much like Ariel Du Bois. She is FRANCESCA DU BOIS, a high priced prostitute disguised as an international newspaper reporter.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
Senator Stryker. I have someone I'd like you<br />
<br />
to meet. Madamemoiselle Francesca Du Bois, political<br />
<br />
correspondent for Le Monde.<br />
<br />
FRANCESCA<br />
<br />
Senator Stryker. I've heard so much about<br />
<br />
you. It is a pleasure to finally meet you.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
One of the more pleasant amenities from<br />
<br />
Europe.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
(kisses hand, eyes her hungrily) Enchante,<br />
<br />
Madamoiselle Du Bois.<br />
<br />
FRANCESCA<br />
<br />
Perhaps, Senator, later on you could honor<br />
<br />
me with an interview?<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
If this your way of getting me to vote 'yes'<br />
<br />
for the war, Mr. President . . .<br />
<br />
Some laughter ensues, but not from the president.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
(notices Rayne's tacit approval) Everything,<br />
<br />
I take it then, is to you--satisfaction, gentlemen?<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Very much so, Mr. President.<br />
<br />
Cahill leaves, Francesca still on his arm.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- RESTAURANT -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina and Charles exit the restaurant together, head for her car.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
We can pick up your car tomorrow.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It's my mother's car. She lets me use it whenever<br />
<br />
I'm in town.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Ah, still another mystery solved. The gentle-<br />
<br />
man doesn't own his own car. Or does he?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Oh, I have a car all right. It's just--out of commission<br />
<br />
right now.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
(opens car door) Likely story. You just don't want to<br />
<br />
put a lot of miles yet on brand new tires. Men. You're<br />
<br />
all alike.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Something like that.<br />
<br />
They get in, drive off.<br />
<br />
INT. -- WHITE HOUSE STATE DINING HALL<br />
<br />
Jackson/Rayne and Trenton still deep in conversation.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
Why do you always have to act like your best<br />
<br />
friends with him?<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
One hand continually washes the other in<br />
<br />
order to get things done in this business.<br />
<br />
Or has politics taught you nothing in<br />
<br />
dealing with your enemies?<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
Cahill deserves what he's going to get.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
I am sure, no less than you.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
You're certain Cahill will be killed and<br />
<br />
I will become the next president of the<br />
<br />
United States?<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
If all goes to plan, it will ensure a dynasty<br />
<br />
for the Sommers men--if you don't kill your<br />
<br />
son first.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
I do hope you're talking about my youngest<br />
<br />
son, Oliver, and not that addle brained<br />
<br />
mamma's boy, Rayne.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
Speaking of your first born, I saw a new face<br />
<br />
in the media crowd today with that Jones woman,<br />
<br />
working in the study when I was with Rayne.<br />
<br />
He'll need to be checked out.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
(grabbing cell phone, dialing) I'll get right<br />
<br />
on it. (into phone) Chief of Security . . .<br />
<br />
INT. -- ROSS KENYON'S CONDO/LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
Charles, Wilhelmina enter. Wilhelmina turns on the lights and heads for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
There's a bottle of wine in the frig.<br />
<br />
Glasses in the cupboard. I won't be long.<br />
<br />
As Charles retrieves the bottle of wine, opens it as Wilhelmina enters the bathroom.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
You're sure your boss won't mind my using<br />
<br />
his digs for a couple of days.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
He has guests staying here all the time.<br />
<br />
Besides, he's in Aspen right now, with a<br />
<br />
certain Agnes Covington . . .<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(reacting to the name) Did you say Agnes Covington?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You know her?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Yeah, you could say I do, yeah. (spots a CD player)<br />
<br />
Do you mind if I put some music on?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Help yourself. I'll just be a couple more minutes.<br />
<br />
INT. -- BATHROOM<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina sadly looks at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
FLASHBACK: and recalls her argument with Ross earlier at the station, how it ended.<br />
<br />
END FLASHBACK.<br />
<br />
SOUND: THE ALARM ON HER WATCH GOES OFF, reminding her to take her medication. She takes her case of her birth control pills out of her handbag and reaches for a pill. Then stops, thinking a moment on it, about Charles and what an encounter with him could mean for her. Throwing caution to the wind, she opens her birth control pill case, drops the entire package of pills into the toilet, flushes it down, and leaves the bathroom.<br />
<br />
INT. -- LIVING ROOM<br />
<br />
As quiet music plays in the background, Wilhelmina grabs her wine, cozies up to Charles, preparing for her one night stand.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
So. Tell me a little bit about yourself.<br />
<br />
Your story. And how I'm going to die.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
There isn't that much to tell. If<br />
<br />
everything goes to plan, you won't die.<br />
<br />
She spots his silver-coated St. Christopher's medallion, begins playing with it.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
No? That's good to hear. You must be very religious<br />
<br />
because--wasn't St. Christopher kicked out of sainthoodâ€”<br />
<br />
or are you a man who just likes to wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
Charles takes necklace off, gives it to Wilhelmina.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Old mother's superstition. Here. It'll<br />
<br />
look much better on you.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina puts it on, continues seduction.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I think my luck is beginning to change<br />
<br />
alreadyâ€”if I'm going to travel in the<br />
<br />
next day or two.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(persuaded towards having sex with her)<br />
<br />
You feel it--too?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You might say that. (long pause) You say<br />
<br />
you're here because you know of a possible<br />
<br />
assassination attempt on the president's<br />
<br />
lifeâ€”yet there isn't that much to tell<br />
<br />
about who you are or where you come from.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I guess you could say that makes me a man<br />
<br />
of mystery.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
And me a hard-assed reporter, Mr. Martel, who<br />
<br />
can smell a story miles away. You'll have to<br />
<br />
do much better than that. Much better before<br />
<br />
--I back off. â€”Ooh, I love this tune. It's my<br />
<br />
favorite. Would you care to dance?<br />
<br />
They begin to slow dance as the tune plays.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Okay. So, when should start expecting<br />
<br />
the third degree?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You have a woman waiting for you back home?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Whoa. Wait. Back up for a second. Let me<br />
<br />
rephrase that question. So, when should I<br />
<br />
start expecting the personal third degree?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Isn't that what interrogating a suspect is supposed<br />
<br />
to be all about?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I was expecting more of a question like:<br />
<br />
are you the one who's planning to assassinate<br />
<br />
the president?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
(seductively) Well--are you?<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
If I didn't know any better, I'd think you<br />
<br />
were trying to seduce me.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Would that really be so bad if I was?<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(sobering, sad) No. I guess not. Not<br />
<br />
anymore.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Oh?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It's nothing like that. My fiancâ€”back<br />
<br />
home--was murdered. And it all ties<br />
<br />
somehow into this possible assassination.<br />
<br />

You can call me W J.<br />

Did you find anything yet on that cameraman?<br />

No. Right now we've got bigger problems at Acceleron.<br />

CAMERA SHOT: TRENTON WITH 12-YEAR-OLD SON, RAYNE. TRENTON REMAINS ON THE PHONE. RAYNE HAS BEEN CRYING, HIS FACE BRUISED FROM ANOTHER BATTERING. In the background there is a beautiful wooden glass case, locked, where Trenton keeps it stocked with his hunting rifles, bullets. The room is littered with trophies of animal heads hanging on the walls.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
So, get your butt out of bed and get down<br />

He slams the receive downâ€”still angry over his son's disobedience, and 'Jackson Stryker.'<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
You are never going to see that bitch again.<br />
<br />
Do you understand me? And if your mother EVER calls<br />
<br />
here again trying to get you to go live with her in<br />
<br />
California, you'll be spending your days at that boarding<br />
<br />
school in Europe instead of with your friends. Why can't<br />

INT. -- ROSS KENYON'S CONDO/BEDROOM -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
Charles is fast asleep. Wilhelmina is on the computer in the bedroom, still wearing Charles' necklace. She's stolen Charles's flash drives, looking for anything that will tell her anything about him. She, instead, encounters documented history that hasn't even happened yet--things still far into the future! In the background the television is on running a news program showing pictures of China's invasion into Korea and PREMIER YANG in Beijing vowing to go into Taiwan and Japan next. Wilhelmina pays no attention to the news bulletins.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Jesus. Who are you, Charles Martel?<br />
<br />
He stirs momentarily, alerting Wilhelmina, but remains asleep.<br />
<br />
SOUND: HER CELL PHONE 'HUMS.' Shaking from what she's been reading, she snatches up the phone, answers.<br />

WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Yeah, Al. What is it?<br />

<br />
of reporters here already.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Be right there.<br />
<br />
She hangs up, grabs her clothes. Looking over at Charles one more time, still shaking, she tiptoes out the door, leaving everything on: the television, the computer, the flash drives and the last computer page she was scanning about Ariel Du Bois, the ILLEGIMATE DAUGHTER OF PRESIDENT CAHILL on screen.<br />

Reporters are everywhere clamoring for the scoop as cameras flash away taking pictures of the young genius who's smiling into them. It is a very young Ed Saunders, accompanied by his also very young friends and co-workers and co-geniuses, George and Thomas. Behind them are all sorts of computers and lab equipment, including an old style 5100 computer from the 1970's, now set around the rooms as displays. Al is among<br />
<br />
the reporters waiting for Wilhelmina to show.<br />

I warned you anythingâ€”ANYTHING could create<br />

You've got to get back there as soon as this press<br />

Charlie's awakened by voices on the television. His mother's doing some last minute things, getting the house and some things taken care of before they leave for Canada. Charlie peers out his window believing his Uncle Charles has come for another visit.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Uncle Charles?<br />
<br />
But young Charlie only sees the Rover out in the driveway. No sign of his mom's car or his 'Uncle Charles.' Picking up his brown teddy bear, he walk to the hallway closet to get a jacket, puts it on and proceeds out the door, managing to totally avoid his mother's watchful eye.<br />

INT. -- ROSS'S CONDO<br />
<br />
The older Charles awakens to find the television blaring the breaking news story at Acceleron. He sees the computer screen on, too, and the picture of Ariel Wilhelmina found on his drives. Quickly pulling on his clothes, he hurries to the computer to discover that's not the only page Wilhelmina has looked at. Pages printed out on Cahill, the two Sommersâ€”along with a story on the disappearance of Jackson Stryker after Sommers' assassination, all marked in black felt pen with the date: 2056, litter the work desk.<br />
<br />

Oh, my God. She knows.<br />

<br />
Before Rayne shows his anger at Prescott for grabbing him, Trenton enters the corridor, no worse for the wear.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
Sorry, I was a bit delayed. A family<br />
<br />
emergency.<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />
<br />
I'll just bet.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina gasps, beginning to understand the young 12-year old Rayne Sommers is the grown up man now standing before her known Jackson Stryker. Trenton spots Wilhelmina/panics.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
It's that reporter!<br />
<br />
The others see Wilhelmina. Found out, panicking, she flees.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />

How much has she heard?<br />
<br />
JACKSON/RAYNE<br />

Running as fast as she can, Wilhelmina tries to find an escape. She slips into to nook just big enough to hide her to avoid them until she can steal away again in the opposite direction. She runs until she locates an out of the way room and enters . . .<br />
<br />
INT. -- ACCELERON TIME MACHINE ROOM<br />
<br />
. . . where she encounters Rayne Sommers' PERSONAL TIME MACHINE. But she doesn't quite know, yet, it is a time machine. With just enough time for her to look it over, almost as quickly, the men, having back-tracked, follow her into the room. Hearing their voices just outside the door, she panics again as they burst in, and falls back into the time machine, which has already been primed and is waiting for Rayne to step in for his journey back.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Wilhelmina is surrounded by a thick fog while greeted by a voice as the machine activates.<br />
<br />
TIME MACHINE VOICE<br />
<br />
Accelerating to sixteen years per minute.<br />

WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Oh my God! Where are you taking me? Where<br />

am I going? Let me out!<br />

Outside, Prescott, Rayne and Trenton watch the machine as it vanishes into thin air.<br />

<br />
You've got to keep her away from the forum tomorrow<br />

before the whole world learns they've<br />

Oh, I'll make sure she dies, all right. As<br />

They head to the lab.<br />

<br />
Young Rayne is in the living room, alone, bags packed. He's running away from home. One last thing, however, remains on his mind. Holding the key to his father's gun cabinet, he walks to the cabinet, unlocks and opens it, takes out a rifle and bullets, placing everything in the carrying case, then walks out the door, bag and baggage and gun.<br />

INT. -- TIME 2056 A. D. DIRECTOR SOMMERS'S OFFICE -- NIGHT/WAR ACTIVITY LIGHTS UP THE DISTANT HORIZON<br />
<br />
The time machine has stopped. Gingerly, Wilhelmina steps out into a whole, brave new worldâ€”the world of dictator Director Rayne Sommers. His office is abuzz with world events on the monitors, but no one seems to be around at the moment. The room is quiet except for a slight sobbing she can barely hear as the dim murmur of angry voices outside in the surrounding streets begin to reach her ears. The tall picture windows exposing people clustering into the middle of the street captures her attention for a moment, until she spies a beautiful woman, 44, alone, sitting in the director's chair, her back toward her. a gunâ€”the derringer that Rayne used to shoot himself with-- rests squarely in her hands. Wilhelmina recognizes her from the pictures she found on Charles' flash drives. It is a very much alive Ariel Du Bois. She has come to Sommers' office to confront him. As Wilhelmina cautiously approaches, Ariel finally hears her, turns, and, seeing her, points her gun directly at Wilhelmina.<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
Don't come any closer. I have a right<br />
<br />
to be here.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
(extreme caution) I know who you are.<br />
<br />
You're Ariel Du Bois. I'm not here to hurt<br />
<br />
you. I'm a reporter, Wilhelmina Jones, my<br />
<br />
friends call me W J. Can you please tell<br />
<br />
me where I am?<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
You are a reporter and you don't know?<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina tries to move closer, but Ariel, more determined than ever, points the gun dead straight at her. Wilhelmina slowly raises her hands.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
No. I'm afraid I'm not from around here.<br />
<br />
I guess you could say I'm lost.<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />

<br />
Sommers, glorious dictator and leader of the<br />

WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Trenton Sommers . . .<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
(confused) No. His sonâ€”Rayne. Some believe<br />
<br />
Rayne had his own father murdered the day he<br />
<br />
took power--and all his political opponents<br />
<br />
arrested, tried and executed on trumped up<br />
<br />
charges when they tried to stop him.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
And you're here?<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
Some say he had my father murdered, too, but<br />
<br />
his body was never found.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
And your father was?<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
Now that is the question, isn't it? For years<br />
<br />
I truly believed Mars Cahill was my father.<br />
<br />
And for years that is what my mother always<br />
<br />
told me, until, one day, I found a birth certificate<br />
<br />
with my name on it while I was working on some secret<br />
<br />
files for Director Sommers. It was buried with several<br />
<br />
other confidential papers pertaining to a man by<br />
<br />
the name of Jackson Stryker.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
He's a Senator . . .(under breath) My God.<br />
<br />
Charlie wasn't . . .<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
All these years, may God rest her soulâ€”IN<br />
<br />
HELLâ€”my mother lied to me. All these years.<br />
<br />
And I was so happy thinking my father was a<br />
<br />
president of the United States.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Why would--Rayne Sommers--have your real<br />
<br />
birth certificate in his filesâ€”unless . . .<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
He murdered my father, Jackson Stryker? That<br />
<br />
is why I have come hereâ€” to his offices--to<br />
<br />
learn the truthâ€”and to kill him myself, if he did!<br />
<br />
SOUND: VOICES OUTSIDE IN THE STREETS GROWING LOUDER AND ANGRIER as Wilhelmina reels from what she's just heard. She now knows she has traveled through time into the future and knows now that that is where Charles is from, too. Slowly walking to the huge picture windows encompassing Rayne's office, Wilhelmina watches the masses gather outside, joining in protest as she tries to absorb everything she's just learned.<br />

As Ed and Prescott argue, George and Thomas realize they've been had and go directly to work stealthily concealing some old standard floppy disks, with directions on how to make their time machine, inside an old-style 5100 computer they have sitting in an out of the way place in the lab/museum, as all eyes remain on Ed and Prescott.<br />

This is very strange. Surely you must know.<br />
<br />
It--doesn't exist anymore.<br />
<br />
The noise of the crowd grows deafening. Some are beginning to chant the word 'Messiah.' Wilhelmina leans closer toward the window get a better look as the crowd begins to encircle a gigantic dais arising in their midst. A young man has suddenly appeared in the streets, dressed in the long, dark robes of a monk/priest, and wearing a large cross around his neck, along with a second, silvery-looking medallion Wilhelmina can't quite make out. He carries with him a long, crooked staff as he slowly ascends the steps to the podium. Wilhelmina notices<br />
<br />
how very much he looks like Charles--how much he already commands the attention of his audience.<br />

How long are we to endure more pain, more<br />
<br />
suffering at the hands of this madman who<br />
<br />
calls himself our protectorâ€”our savior?<br />

Since this earth was created, it has never<br />
<br />
been the rich. They do not suffer from want,<br />
<br />
from lack to buy food, clothing, and shelter,<br />
<br />
and to take care of their children. It is not<br />
<br />
the self-proclaimed despots who pretend they<br />
<br />
are society's chosen, but us, destined to share<br />
<br />
in the same fate. And certainly not those who<br />
<br />
continue to assure us they rule justly and in<br />
<br />
accordance with the divine laws, who say they<br />
<br />
tirelessly, willingly burden themselves in the<br />
<br />
name of their love for humanity, but in truth,<br />
<br />
only live to satisfy their hunger and thirst<br />
<br />
for power and dominance over us. They profess<br />
<br />
to love the common man, while demanding just<br />
<br />
one more act of legislation against us. One<br />
<br />
more pound of flesh to keep us destitute and<br />
<br />
poor. One more treaty to sign to further their<br />
<br />
dreams of war and conquest, to keep us at bay,<br />
<br />
until they have finally devoured and subjugated<br />
<br />
the whole of humanity, our children, our<br />
<br />
futures, herding us like sheep into the pens<br />
<br />
for the sheering, like cattle for the slaughter!<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina hears the dim roaring of the crowd. She feels their hearts stirring and marvels how easily this young man sways them. She marvels how easily she is persuaded by his words.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Who is he?<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
The man I'd hoped to marry one day.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
He sounds like some sort of doomsayer.<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
Yet, not a doomsayer. More like a prophet<br />
<br />
of God.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I've never really believed in a higher power<br />
<br />
--or even destiny, for that matter, but there<br />
<br />
is something in his voice. I can't explain it.<br />
<br />
The people do seem to be hopelessly drawn to<br />
<br />
him.<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
I will always love Bryce. But at least, I<br />
<br />
know I have found some comfort in the arms of<br />
<br />
a man who reminds me very much of him. Every<br />
<br />
time I look into his eyes. I do love Charles,<br />
<br />
but it will never be in the way I will always<br />
<br />
love Bryce.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Bryce? That's his name?<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
Bryce Kenyon.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
(taken back) Not Ross Kenyon's son?<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
This is very strange. I thought everyone knew<br />
<br />
about Bryce Kenyon.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina shakes her head no.<br />
<br />
ARIEL<br />
<br />
Many claim he is the Messiah of the Second coming.<br />
<br />
Others the coming of the prophet Elijah. To me,<br />
<br />
he is just the man I will always love.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina turns away, unable to process it all. A tear trickles down her cheek.<br />

You're always sneaking out of the house, going<br />

WILHELMINA<br />

cry all the time. I'm just--ecstatic--<br />
<br />
because--today, I decided to end my marriage<br />

Bryce see in you.<br />

is desperately in need of. A world, a people<br />

world where no man, woman or child has to<br />

<br />
INDIVIUAL CAMERA SHOTS: THOMAS, GEORGE, EMILY LYING IN THE STREETS, SHOT DEAD BY SOMMERS' ARMY. ED'S BODY LIES, RAIN-SOAKED, BY SOMMERS' FEET. The streets run red with blood of the martyrs. Rayne and his troops have succeeded in capturing Bryce Kenyon. They now have him in custody, in shackles. Bryce, now a torn, defeated man, still remains defiantâ€”raging against the powers that have prevailed. Rayne prepares a fit death for Bryce: he has stripped him nearly naked and is now about to CRUCIFY him before a remnant of the defeated street mob that worships him.<br />

RAYNE<br />

Some kind of Messiah you've turned out<br />
<br />
to be.<br />

I am not the Messiah. He is yet to come.<br />

<br />
for his people.<br />

If you are not the Messiah, then, where is<br />

I LOVED HER, TOO!<br />

More than angered by Bryce's defiance, he strikes him hard in the face. Then orders his men.<br />
<br />
RAYNE<br />
<br />
And yet, you abandoned her, for this<br />
<br />
madness? Finish him off.<br />

Quickly, they pound the nails into Bryce's hands, as Bryce cries out in searing pain, and set the cross up for the whole world to see, as the rain continues to pound the streets and all who remain in them.<br />

(eyeing the man for a long, contemplative<br />
<br />
moment, on the cross). Let it all be<br />
<br />
finishedâ€”now.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Rayne walks away back to his headquarters as mourners line the streets over their dead, crying and howling from the tragedy of the night's events.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- DE HAVILAND MUSEUM/ABANDONED ACCELERON BUILDINGS --<br />
<br />
NIGHT<br />
<br />
Charles parks in front of the once bustling Acceleron laboratories to find their building turned into a museum and the rest of the building with harboring trucks and eighteen-wheelers loading up equipment to transport it to other places. Acceleron is now officially closed, and in the midst of being dismantled. The grounds are crawling with security guards. Charles looks down at the discharged gun. He can't hide it now in the office building as he'd planned.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I guess you're gonna have to come home<br />
<br />
with me now.<br />
<br />
Charles puts his Rover in gear and heads out again to Ross Kenyon's condo.<br />
<br />
INT. -- ROSS KENYON'S CONDO -- DARK<br />
<br />
As Charles enters the apartment, Wilhelmina is still sitting in the dark on the couch weeping, crazed with fear, grief, confusion. He finds her there as she finds him entering. They run to each other, half filled with relief, still half in fear for each other's safety. They kiss.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Oh, God! Charlie! He killed her! He<br />
<br />
killed her! He killed all of them--in<br />
<br />
cold blood.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Who killed who?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Jackson Stryker. He killed Ariel.â€”Butâ€”<br />
<br />
it wasn't--Jackson Stryker.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina looks deeply into Charlie's eyes, his face, and suddenly something deep strikes a chord within her.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
You're Bryce . . . Kenyon. You . . .<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina. No. I only look like Bryce.<br />
<br />
Kenyon. I did it to disguise myself in<br />
<br />
this time period. I don't really look<br />
<br />
like this.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
You were there.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Charlie. Oh, God. Charlie! I want to<br />
<br />
die!<br />
<br />
In the moment of her deepest grief, she and Charles reach out to her and make made passionate love one more time.<br />
<br />
DISSOLVE TO:<br />
<br />
INT. -- CONDO BEDROOM<br />
<br />
TIME HAS LAPSED. Wilhelmina and Charles are fast asleep. Wilhelmina is having a HORRIBLE DREAM. In her dream she sees Bryce being crucified on the cross and crying out to her. It sounds as if he is crying out the word 'Mother' to her. It startles her awake out of her deep sleep. She is damp with a cold sweat. Her cell phone is humming again. It's Al on the other end. Finally hearing it, she answers it, still in a grand stupor. She is still wearing Charles' medallion.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
VOICE ON PHONE: AL<br />
<br />
W J. Where've you been? I've been<br />
<br />
calling and calling.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I've beenâ€”chasing down a story.<br />
<br />
VOICE ON PHONE: AL<br />
<br />
Something's going down. It's all over the<br />
<br />
wire. The Russian premier's plane is<br />
<br />
missingâ€”somewhere over the Urals. They<br />
<br />
think it was sabotaged. China's million<br />
<br />
man army's on the moveâ€”headed straight for<br />
<br />
Taiwan. And Rayne Sommers, Trenton Sommers'<br />
<br />
kid is reported missing. We've got that<br />
<br />
forum tonight and Ross isn't back yet. I<br />
<br />
need you at the studiosâ€”NOW.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, I know, Al. Give me a few.<br />
<br />
I'm not awake yet. I have to get dressed.<br />
<br />
I'll be there as soon as I can.<br />
<br />
She hangs up the phone, looks at Charles one more time and then heads for the bathroom to shower and dress. Charles is still fast asleep.<br />
<br />
SHORT TIME LAPSE.<br />
<br />
Dressed, ready to go, Wilhelmina leaves a note for Charles to read when she's gone. She leaves as Charles still sleeps the early morning hours away.<br />
<br />
INT. -- KATHRYN'S HOME -- DAY<br />
<br />
Kathryn is bustling around the house, putting things away, covering the furniture with sheets, preparing to leave for Canada the next morning. The TV is on. She is listening to the news. A morning newscaster reports among the items going on around the world:<br />
<br />
MORNING NEWSCASTER<br />
<br />
In the news this morning: Russia's premier,<br />
<br />
Illya Kovinoski, is still reported missing.<br />
<br />
And China has launched and all out attack on<br />
<br />
Taiwan as Iran continues its threats to<br />
<br />
invade Jerusalem. On the local scene: in<br />

<br />
White House chief of staff Henri Dickerson<br />
<br />
reports this morning Rayne Sommers, twelve<br />
<br />
year old son of Vice-president Trenton Sommers<br />
<br />
has been missing since midnight last night . . .<br />
<br />
Young Charlie is helping Kathryn. At the moment, he has his brown teddy bear in his arms and his jacket on ready to play outside.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Charlie. Do you have everything you want<br />
<br />
to take with you? Once we're gone we won't<br />
<br />
be coming back for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Charlie doesn't answer. He silently exits the door with his teddy bear . . .<br />
<br />
EXT. -- OUTSIDE KATHRYN'S HOME<br />
<br />
and heads for his mother's car. He opens the back door, lays his teddy bear down on the back seat and then closes the door again, re-entering the house.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: ANOTHER MAN IN A SINISTER LOOKING SUIT has been watching the house and Charlie. Once Charlie is back inside, the man goes to the back of Kathryn's car and places a bomb under the bumper, beside the gas tank, and setting the detonator to go off when prompted. When finished, he vanishes.<br />
<br />
INT. -- ROSS'S CONDO/BEDROOM -- DAY<br />
<br />
Charlie finally awakens.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina?--W J.<br />
<br />
When he finally realizes she has gone, he spots the note she's left him. He reads it.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Please don't try to follow me. This is<br />
<br />
goodbye. I'll be all right. I promise<br />
<br />
I'll be careful. It's been fun, Charlie,<br />
<br />
but now, go home. Go back to when you<br />
<br />
belong. W J.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(out loud, to self) Charlie. You've got<br />
<br />
to stop her.<br />
<br />
He grabs for the phone, tries to call her. But the voice mail kicks in.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA'S VOICE MAIL MESSAGE<br />
<br />
This is W J. I'm out of my office right now tracking<br />
<br />
down a hot story. But if you leave me a tip on a<br />
<br />
better one, I'll get back to you a-s-a-p.<br />
<br />
SOUND: BEEP.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina. It's Charlie. I know you're<br />
<br />
confused, but it'll be okay after I explain<br />
<br />
everything. Look. Whether you want me to<br />
<br />
or not, I'm coming out thereâ€”after . . .<br />

<br />
Wilhelmina and Al have the broadcasting van packed, just about ready to head out to Lafayette Park to set up for the forum.<br />

WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
That oughta do it. I don't think we can<br />
<br />
get another piece of equipment in this<br />
<br />
old rattletrap.<br />
<br />
AL<br />
<br />
(picking up) What's wrong Wil? Something's<br />
<br />
changed. I can't quite put my finger on it.<br />
<br />
Something has changed. Wilhelmina hands Al the 'keys to the kingdom,' WSGT-TV.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I handed in my resignation this morning.<br />
<br />
--And I'm divorcing Ross. Oh, by the way,<br />
<br />
tomorrow you'll be contacted by my lawyer.<br />
<br />
Congratulations, Al. You're now the proud<br />
<br />
owner of half of Ross's WSGT â€“ TV stock.<br />

Charlie enters the park looking for Wilhelmina.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: IN ANOTHER SECTION OF THE PARK NEAR PLATFORM.<br />
<br />
YOUNG THOMAS AND GEORGE sit waiting in an out of the way place near the platform for the forum to begin. They harbor guns, rifles secretively in hidden receptacles. As protestors gather round them, they each grab a gun or rifle for themselves.<br />
<br />
PROTESTOR<br />
<br />
Thanks, Thomas, George. I hope we won't<br />
<br />
have to use these. But if we have to . . .<br />
<br />
THOMAS<br />
<br />
I hope we won't have to either.<br />

The satisfied protestor leaves as young Ed comes joins Thomas and George. More protestors continue to come and go. Ed's on pins and needles. His wife is about to birth any moment. He awaits the phone call.<br />

Let's hope it stays peaceful.<br />

We won't miss, Uncle Charles, will we?<br />
<br />
He promised to come see us before we go.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
We'll be back in plenty of time.â€” I promise.<br />

AL<br />
<br />
I'll hook up the TVS first so we can<br />
<br />
monitor the news.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I'll check my messages.<br />
<br />
As Al climbs back into the van, Wilhelmina opens her cell phone. She hears Charles's voice/message, but quickly deletes it and puts her phone away again. Al calls out.<br />
<br />
AL<br />
<br />
Anything to report?<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
No. Nothing so important it can't wait.<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
Another far off corner of the park behind a hedge of bushes a young boy sits on the steps of a nearby building, surrounded by his bags, backpack and gun case. He is very sad. It is young Rayne Sommers. Charles spots him and gingerly approaches. He starts talking to him, readily noticing the prominent bruises on the boy's face. Charles realizes the boy has had yet another, recent, beating from his father.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Rayne, what are you doing here?<br />
<br />
But the boy won't speak at first.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'm sure your father's told you never to<br />
<br />
speak to strangers, but I'm not really a<br />
<br />
stranger. Remember I was the cameraman<br />
<br />
at the White Houseâ€”in the study--the<br />
<br />
other day.<br />
<br />
Young Rayne nods, he remembers.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Looks like you're all packed and ready to<br />
<br />
go. Are you going somewhere?<br />
<br />
YOUNG RAYNE<br />
<br />
To California to see my mother. But I<br />
<br />
don't have enough money to buy the ticket.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(reaching into pocket) I think I can fix<br />
<br />
that. (pulls out some money) I won't be<br />
<br />
needing these after tonight. There's a<br />
<br />
bus depot nearby. Why don't I take you so<br />
<br />
you can buy your ticket and get on the bus<br />
<br />
there?<br />
<br />
Rayne agrees, and picking up everything, goes with Charles.<br />

EXT. -- BUS DEPOT -- DAY<br />
<br />
Charles is at the window with young Rayne. They buy the ticket and then Charles gives Rayne the rest of the money to take with him on the trip.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(to ticket master) Thanks. (to Rayne)<br />
<br />
Here you go. One ticket to Sacramento.<br />
<br />
(hands young Rayne ticket, offers money)<br />
<br />
Why don't you take the rest of this, too.<br />
<br />
You'll be needing something to eat along<br />
<br />
the way. Sacramento's a long way from<br />
<br />
Washington.<br />
<br />
YOUNG RAYNE<br />
<br />
Thanks. (pockets money, ticket)<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
You can call me Charlie. There's a bench<br />
<br />
right next to the building over there (points).<br />
<br />
You'll be safe there until the bus comes to<br />
<br />
pick you and the other passengers up. Okay?<br />
<br />
Young Rayne walks to the bench. Charles watches him go confidentially.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Goodbye, Rayne. Have a better life.<br />

Older Rayne stands in the pouring rain satisfied Bryce is dead.<br />

An OFFICER OF THE GUARD stands by him, awaiting orders.<br />

OLDER RAYNE<br />
<br />
I have just one last, little detail to<br />
<br />
take care of before I will be able to<br />
<br />
return to this world for good.<br />
<br />
OFFICER OF THE GUARD<br />
<br />
We will be waiting your return, Director<br />

Angrily, Older Rayne tosses the necklace and medallion far from him into the darkness and heads for his headquarters to return to the past.<br />

EXT. -- LA FAYETTE PARK<br />
<br />
The day is wearing on. Charles has returned from taking Rayne to the bus depot. He crosses to the platform area where he spots Al and Wilhelmina setting up the equipment for the night's forum. Wilhelmina spots Charles. Charles approaches the van.<br />
<br />
AL<br />
<br />
(giving them space) I'm gonna go<br />
<br />
get something to eat. (leaves)<br />

Not if it means it is going to kill you.<br />

There are worse things in this life,<br />
<br />
like being lied to--over and over.<br />

CHARLES<br />

I'm not Ross. And I was going to tell<br />
<br />
you the truth--eventually.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Yeah? Well, here's a scoop for you.<br />
<br />
I already know the truth. And it hurts<br />
<br />
really bad. As far as I know, you don't<br />
<br />
even exist yet! God! I'm making love<br />
<br />
to a man that doesn't even exist yet!<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina. Time. It really is all<br />
<br />
relative. Yesterday, today, tomorrow. How<br />
<br />
ever it comes to us. That's what makes it<br />
<br />
so beautifulâ€”so unique. For you, right now,<br />
<br />
I do exist, here, in this now. And I'm not<br />
<br />
about to let some maniac loose out there in<br />
<br />
the few hours we have left together kill what<br />
<br />
little happiness we've found with each other<br />
<br />
â€”in this now. I won't let him kill you. So,<br />
<br />
get over it! You're not going to die tonight<br />
<br />
--not on this time traveler's watch.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina hugs, kisses him.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'll be back. I want to scour this park<br />

before it gets dark.<br />

Kathryn waits Charles return, all ready and packed, with the exception of a couple bags by the couch. She waits in a darkened house, living room, waiting for him to show so they can finally be on their way. Charles has fallen asleep beside her on the couch. She smiles as she watches over him.

Kathryn is beginning to really worry now. It's almost time to depart for the airport. Gently, she picks up Charles so as not to wake him, bundling him up in a blanket so no one can see what she is carrying out of the house and, . . .<br />

Stealthily, she heads out the door, Charlie in her arms, to her car. Laying him in the back seat, she covers him up so no one can see him sleeping in the car. She locks the doors and goes back into the houseâ€”and turns on her TV hoping to learn what's keeping Charles.<br />

The crowd is turning ugly, waving their JACKSON STRYKER placards, chanting his name. Wilhelmina Jones frantically reports the events now as Cahill tries to speak to the crowd. In the background, Charles continues to keep a sharp eye out for the assassinâ€”remembering where he saw the gun barrel appear.<br />

<br />
RIVAL NEWSCASTER<br />
<br />
Mr. President. Russia is reportedly blaming<br />
<br />
the U S for their premier's plane missing over<br />
<br />
the Urals. Would you care to elaborate on that?<br />
<br />
Cahill tries to answer, but Wilhelmina jumps on his words.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
President Cahill, China's recent forced annexation<br />
<br />
of both Koreas and now with their<br />
<br />
move this morning against Taiwan, what do you<br />
<br />
intend to do? Will there be a confrontation<br />
<br />
in the Far East?<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
There has been no word as yet on Premier Kovinoski.<br />
<br />
And no, the U-S is not responsible.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
But there have been indications the CIA has<br />
<br />
been operating in Eastern Europe recently.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
(getting frustrated, angry) As far as the<br />
<br />
Far East is concerned, Ms. Jones, of course,<br />
<br />
we will continue to pursue our policies of<br />
<br />
peaceful negotiations with the Chinese. As<br />
<br />
for the CIA being involved in covert opera-<br />
<br />
tions in Eastern Europe, there is no truth<br />

to the rumor.<br />

CAHILL<br />
<br />
WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION, Ms. Jones? (off side<br />
<br />
to his staff aide) Have her investigated.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
It's a real possibility now Jackson Stryker<br />
<br />
will be elected the next president. Will it<br />
<br />
change current policies if Stryker is elected?<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
That question is out of line, Ms. Jones.<br />
<br />
(very angry) I intend to be re-elected come<br />
<br />
this November. And I have no intention<br />
<br />
of relinquishing power to a wet behind the<br />
<br />
ears Senator OR changing current policies in<br />
<br />
midstream. But make no mistake. If China is<br />
<br />
hell bent on starting a war with the United<br />

States, I WILL defend my country to the death.<br />

<br />
(shouts) What about those of us who are starving,<br />
<br />
Mr. President? Don't you care about us?<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: CHARLES WITH WILHELMINA. The crowd's anger is visibly rising, alerting Charles.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Boy, you sure know how to stir up a crowd<br />
<br />
--and a president.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Born muckraker.--I've never seen a crowd so<br />
<br />
angry before. (to Al) Al, can you get a shot<br />
<br />
of some of the protestors' faces?<br />

TAKING IN ALL THE ANGER AND FRUSTRATION OF THE MOB.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It'll be starting any moment. Stay close<br />
<br />
to me.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Charlieâ€”I do trust you, but I'm really<br />
<br />
scared.<br />
<br />
As she turns to look at Charles, and Charles her, Wilhelmina begins to see something in his face. She can't quite yet put her finger on itâ€”it's almost like DjÃ  vu.<br />
<br />
ANGRY MOB MEMBEE #3<br />
<br />
What about those of us without jobs and no<br />
<br />
place to live? Don't we count for something,<br />
<br />
Mr. President?<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
I assure you. The government's doing<br />
<br />
everything it can . . .<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
INT. -- KATHRYN'S HOME -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
Kathryn peeks outside her window, one more time, at her car, very nervous, very worried, POV SHOT, making sure everything is peaceful, nothing has been disturbed. The noise on the TV is becoming deafening. She anxiously looks at her watch again. Then goes to her landline phone, picks up the receiver and dials.<br />
<br />
KATHYRN<br />
<br />
I'd better let Agnes know where Charlie<br />
<br />
and I are going.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
But Kathryn's reached only Agnes's voice mail.<br />
<br />
AGNES'S VOICE MAIL<br />
<br />
Leave us a message at the sound of the<br />
<br />
beep.<br />
<br />
SOUND: BEEP.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Agnes. It's me. Don't come home. Charlie<br />
<br />
and I are leaving Washington in a couple of hours.<br />
<br />
I'll try to call again as soon as I<br />
<br />
can to let you know where we'll be.<br />
<br />
She hangs up, returns to the window.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- PRESIDENTIAL FORUM<br />
<br />
Cahill's starting to break down over the crowd's enmity.<br />
<br />
STAFF AIDE<br />
<br />
(interrupts) President Cahill and Vice-<br />
<br />
president Sommers are on top of the situation.<br />
<br />
They are doing everything they can to address<br />
<br />
all of your concerns . . .<br />
<br />
ANGRY MOB MEMBER #5<br />
<br />
Bull! We're tired of your empty promises!<br />
<br />
ANGRY MOB MEMBER #6<br />
<br />
That's not good enough! We want action now!<br />
<br />
We want a new president now!<br />
<br />
ANGRY MOB MEMBER #7<br />
<br />
How can we afford to go to work anymore<br />
<br />
with the gas prices through the roof!<br />
<br />
ANGRY MOB MEMBER #4<br />
<br />
Do something, Mr. President! Mr. Vice-<br />
<br />
president. Before they destroy our country.<br />
<br />
Or are you both cowards?<br />
<br />
CUT TO: Some of the more belligerent members of the crowd are now starting to pass guns around--among other things--as the mob becomes more unmanageable, more unruly. Police start to move in. George and Thomas slowly approach the platform trying to stay calm and keep others of their group calm, too, before the law enforcers now appearing.<br />
<br />
CUT BACK TO:<br />
<br />
ANGRY MOB MEMBER #3<br />
<br />
Yeah! We don't want another four years of<br />
<br />
spineless leadership.<br />
<br />
The crowd roars angrier and angrier. They are beginning to throw things at the president, vice-president and staff aide.<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
BEHIND THE HEDGE CHARLES ALREADY INSPECTED AND A DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE PLATFORM AND CROWD, YOUNG RAYNE kneels behind the bushes, watching, tears steaming down his face as he stares at the podium, his father. He has taken the rifle from its case. It now lies beside him on the groundâ€”waiting.<br />
<br />
CUT BACK TO:<br />
<br />
CAHILL AT PODIUM. Still being barraged by the crowd with various, rotten items, he has decided to make one last statement.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
(scared, whispers to Sommers) Sorry, Trenton.<br />
<br />
But I can't afford having my political career<br />
<br />
going down the tubes any further with a future<br />
<br />
appointment to the U. N. at stake. You've<br />
<br />
always been just too much dead weight anywayâ€”<br />
<br />
with all the rumors. And it's better we get<br />
<br />
out now while the getting's good.<br />
<br />
As Cahill turns back to the angry crowd, Trenton is visibly angered now. He grabs Cahill.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
What do you meanâ€”WE'RE getting out now<br />
<br />
while the getting's good?<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
Just what I said.<br />
<br />
Cahill angrily flings off Trenton's hands from his coat lapels, straightens his coat again and then slowly turns to address the crowdâ€”one more moment.<br />
<br />
CAHILL<br />
<br />
Citizens. I assure you. I am ready to do whatever it<br />
<br />
takes to move this country forward. To keep her number<br />
<br />
one. So, without further adieu, I am here tonight to<br />
<br />
announce vice-president Sommers and my resignations and<br />
<br />
our support for your candidate, the people's candidate,<br />
<br />
for president of the United States, Jackson Stryker.<br />
<br />
Trenton Sommers angrily grabs him again.<br />
<br />
TRENTON<br />
<br />
YOU SON-OF A BITCH! YOU'VE JUST BLOWN MY<br />
<br />
CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!<br />
<br />
THE ANGRY CROWD now presses in, chanting, begging to see Stryker. They want Cahill and Sommers off the podium--NOW. The police are having a difficult time holding the crowd back. They're throwing more and more things at the podium, the president and vice-president. Some have already drawn guns, ready to fire as police take their stand. Wilhelmina tries to get closer to Cahill, Sommers. Charles tries to stop her.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Mr. President!<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(grabbing her) You can't go up there.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina<br />
<br />
(fighting Charles) This is the scoop of the century. Who would've thought Cahill and<br />
<br />
Sommers would be resigning?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina. In a few more hours it's not<br />
<br />
going to matter.<br />
<br />
But Wilhelmina fights to get to Cahill to get more quotes. Charles struggles to stop her.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Mr. President. Tell us why . . .<br />
<br />
CUT BACK TO:<br />
<br />
YOUNG RAYNE kneeling behind the bushes, weeping. The older Rayne Sommers, out of the blue appears in an out of the way place behind the boy in his mini time machine. Stepping out, Rayne sees his young self at the bushes. He walks goes over to young Rayne to strike up a stern conversation.<br />
<br />
OLDER RAYNE<br />
<br />
If it weren't for that monster Cahill,<br />
<br />
you're father wouldn't have beaten you the<br />
<br />
other day like he did. For four years you<br />
<br />
have been your father's personal punching<br />
<br />
bagâ€”because of that man. The one you<br />
<br />
really want to kill is President Cahill<br />
<br />
--not your father.<br />
<br />
The boy reaches for the gun, delighting Rayne.<br />
<br />
OLDER RAYNE<br />
<br />
Yes. That's right. Aim it right at<br />
<br />
Cahill's heart.<br />
<br />
But as he poises the gun, the boy hesitates. Frustrated young Rayne hesitates, the older Rayne takes to bullying the younger Rayne into pulling the triggerâ€”and quickly.<br />
<br />
OLDER RAYNE<br />
<br />
Well? What are you waiting for? Or are<br />
<br />
you the sniveling little coward that<br />
<br />
excuse for a father says you are?<br />
<br />
Sill crying, younger Rayne points the gun, but he cannot bring himself to pulling the trigger. Very angry now, the older Rayne rips the rifle out of the younger Rayne's hands.<br />
<br />
OLDER RAYNE<br />
<br />
Here. Give it to me. I'll do it!<br />
<br />
He takes direct aim.<br />
<br />
OLDER RAYNE<br />
<br />
Die, you son-of-a-bitch!<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
CHARLES. Suddenly, he sees the rifle barrel flashing as it emerges from the thickness of the bushes. Immediately, he dives for Wilhelmina.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(shouts, warning,) GET DOWN!<br />
<br />
But as Charles tries to pull her to the ground, to protect her<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
SOUND: A LOUD, DEAFENING, GUNSHOT GOES OFF.<br />
<br />
Charles takes the hit in his side instead, crumpling from the pain. Wilhelmina, the president, both still unscathed, Wilhelmina turns in time to see Charles shot.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
CHARLIE!!!!<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
OLDER RAYNE. Seeing his first bullet has hit Charles, he takes aim again.<br />
<br />
OLDER RAYNE<br />
<br />
(to younger Rayne still weeping)<br />
<br />
Remember this day when you become ruler<br />
<br />
of the world.<br />
<br />
Older Rayne shoots again.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: This time, the president is hit. Cahill falls, but his wound is not fatal in this timeline. Secret Service rush in to get him to a safe place, surround Sommers, as others take off in the direction of the shot.<br />
<br />
SECRET SERVICE MAN #1<br />
<br />
(examining wound) He's okay. Get him<br />
<br />
out of here and to a hospital, fast!<br />
<br />
More Secret servicemen coming on the scene remove the president to safety. More gunshots.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: George has been hit several times in the leg. Thomas tries to get him out of there before more shots are fired in the fracas and hits him.<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
THE OLDER RAYNE rushes to re-enter his time machine, taking the gun with him, but has to turn back a moment, seeing young Rayne out of the corner of his eye still kneeling behind the bushes.<br />
<br />
OLDER RAYNE<br />
<br />
Come on. You have to leave. Now.<br />
<br />
Before they find you!<br />
<br />
But the younger Rayne will not budge. He just stares at the bushes, crying.<br />
<br />
SOUND: MORE GUNSHOTS RING OUT, this time they are randomly firing from the crowd, then the police.<br />
<br />
OLDER RAYNE<br />
<br />
Do you want them to catch you? The<br />
<br />
police to arrest you? You've got to<br />
<br />
get out of here, now! Go on! Get<br />
<br />
out of here!<br />
<br />
But the boy will not budge. He is paralyzed by what he has just witnessed.<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina is arguing with Charles. She refuses to leave him.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Get out of here. NOW!<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I'm not leaving you!<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(in pain) GO! I'll be okay!<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: As Secret Service surround the vice-president, another bullet makes its way to the podium, this time into Trenton Sommers. Sommers falls to the floor of the platform, dead.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: Wilhelmina and Charles.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(pushing her away) GO! NOW!<br />
<br />
SOUND: JUST AS ANOTHER SHOT GOES OFF, Wilhelmina races out of there just in time for the bullet, meant for her, to strike Charles squarely in the arm instead.<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
Older Rayne, still urging his younger self to leave.<br />
<br />
OLDEER RAYNE<br />
<br />
Leave now, or I will have to take you<br />
<br />
with me.<br />
<br />
But the boy won't move. His eyes are glued to the podium where his father has been shot and killed by a stray bullet. The older Rayne runs to gather up the boy.<br />
<br />
SOUND: ONE LAST GUNSHOT RINGS OUT. It is almost deafening, like it is reaching across time itself to find its target. As Rayne closes in on the boy he is suddenly stopped dead in his tracks as he witnesses the younger Rayne's body stiffen then drop to the ground, the blood oozing from the fatal wound. The boy is shot dead. Rayne rages, horrified . . .<br />
<br />
OLDER RAYNE<br />
<br />
NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
In an instant the older Rayne VANISHES into thin air--from the face of the earth, his time machine following after.<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
CHARLES NEAR PLATFORM. Some of the crowd is still pressing in around him. Some have now scattered, pursued by the police. Charles is hurt, bleeding from his abdomen. Wilhelmina, spent with worry, fear, reappears. Seeing Charles' wound, she tries to help him, tearing some of the cloth from her clothes to make a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. To her, the wound looks pretty bad.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Let me take you to the hospital.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It's not as bad as it looks. You're the<br />
<br />
one who needs to get out of here before<br />
<br />
you're hurt.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I'm not going to leave you.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Yes, you are.<br />
<br />
But she insists on continuing wrapping her rags around Charles' wounds. Charles tries to push her away again.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I need to go backâ€”to finish what I<br />
<br />
started. I can get the help I need<br />
<br />
there.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
Take me with you.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'll come back for you in a few days.<br />
<br />
I promise. But right now, what you<br />
<br />
need to doâ€”for me--is get out of<br />
<br />
Washington as soon as you can--go to<br />
<br />
Canada. You'll be safe there.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina doesn't want to leave him.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I promise. I will come for you. No matter<br />
<br />
how long it takes. I just need to know<br />
<br />
right now you're safe and out of<br />
<br />
Washington.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Wilhelmina goes. One last kiss goodbye. Wilhelmina suddenly realizes deep inside what Charles truly means for her and hesitates no more. As Charles watches her disappear, he knows he has little time left. The wound is bad. But Wilhelmina's bound it tight. There might be time enough to get home, finish his work and get help. He heads to his Rover, gets in and speeds away for Kathryn's.<br />
<br />
DISSOLVE TO:<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: CHARLES DRIVING DOWN A ROAD, ON ROUTE TO KATHRYN'S.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- KATHRYN'S BACKYARD/HOME -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
Charles has made it back. As he pulls in and exits the Rover, Kathryn frantically exits the house, relieved to see him at last. Charles tries to hide his wounds as best he can from her. But she knows something's amiss.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Charlie. What's wrong?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Mom. Are you ready to leave?<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Just a couple more bags to bring out<br />
<br />
of the house. Charlie. What's wrong?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
No time to explain. You have your plane<br />
<br />
tickets and passports.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Yes, they're in the glove compartment.<br />
<br />
Charlie. Don't hide it from me. Tell<br />
<br />
me what's wrong.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'll be fine as soon as I get back to<br />
<br />
my own time. The timeline isn't quite<br />
<br />
repaired yet. That's all. Where's<br />
<br />
Charlie?<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
He's in the car, asleep.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Good.<br />
<br />
POV SHOT. Kathryn opens the car for Charles. He reaches in to pet Charlie as he's sleeping. He's satisfied and closes the car door again.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Let's get those bags.<br />
<br />
They go into the house. But Charlie hasn't been asleep. He gets up.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Uncle Charles?<br />
<br />
But Uncle Charles is not there. Young Charlie opens the door and gets out the car, taking his teddy bear with him, he begins searching for his Uncle Charles.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Uncle Charles.<br />
<br />
He heads for the back of the house.<br />
<br />
INT. -- KATHRYN'S HOME/HALLWAY<br />
<br />
They are ready to exit the house.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
You're sure this is everything.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Yes. (beat) I don't think I'll be<br />
<br />
missing this place for a very long<br />
<br />
time. Let's go.<br />
<br />
Charles, Kathryn exit the house with her remaining items.<br />
<br />
EXT. -- KATHRYN'S HOME<br />
<br />
They put them into the trunk of her car. Charles shuts the trunk again, trying to hide his condition the best he can.<br />
<br />
He gives his mother a long hug, kiss goodbye.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Goodbye, Mom.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
(Long silent pause)<br />
<br />
I hear the mountains in Canada are<br />
<br />
nice this time of year.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
You haven't got much time left. You<br />
<br />
need to get on that plane.<br />
<br />
They hug again.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'll see you when I get back. (one<br />
<br />
last kiss goodbye) Go. Hurry.<br />
<br />
Kathryn gets into her car, starts it and drives off waving behind her. Charles waves back. He then, slowly, gingerly, almost collapsing at one point, finally gets back into his Rover, time machine, turns it on.<br />
<br />
INT. -- ROVER<br />

CHARLES<br />
<br />
Get me home as fast as you can.<br />

<br />
In seconds, Charles, his Rover disappears.<br />
<br />
CUT TO:<br />
<br />
INT. -- TIME MACHINE -- IN TRANSIT TO THE FUTURE<br />
<br />
As Charles configures the dials, the computer talks back to him.<br />
<br />
COMPUTER VOICE<br />
<br />
Accelerating to twenty hours per second.<br />
<br />
Would you like to stop at that candy and<br />

CHARLES<br />
<br />
No. Not tonight.<br />
<br />
Only moments pass, it seems, and Charles is finally on his way back to the future he left behind, untouched, intact, with only a few minor changes in the timelineâ€”barely noticeable at first.<br />
<br />
DISSOLVE TO:<br />
<br />
EXT. -- STREET OUTSIDE A CITY -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
Kathryn has been driving for some time. She's smiling, happy she's on her way to a place of peace and safety.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: TWO MEN IN A CAR, DRESSED IN SINISTER LOOKING SUITS, FOLLOW HER. One has a detonator in his hands ready to use it.<br />
<br />
MAN #1 IN CAR<br />
<br />
Let's blow this thing.<br />
<br />
MAN#2 IN CAR<br />
<br />
I'm definitely ready to go home.<br />
<br />
CUT BACK TO:<br />
<br />
KATHRYN DRIVING.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
We're almost there, Charlie. Soon, we'll<br />
<br />
be in the air, and on our way to Canada.<br />
<br />
But there is no answer. Only silence.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Charlie, honey? Are you awake?<br />
<br />
She looks back into the back seat, discovering Charlie is gone! She panics.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
CHARLIE!!<br />
<br />
The car behind her has been following close behind. As the first man in the car pushes the detonator button, Kathryn's car suddenly careens out of control, hitting the car following her, heading directly for the curb in the street. As it smashes into the other car, the planted bomb goes off. Both cars burst into flames. The two men are burned alive. Kathryn manages to escape, but she is badly burned in the fire as she falls to the ground screaming to put the fires out on her body.<br />
<br />
DISSOLVE TO:<br />
<br />
INT. -- ACCELERON, INC. OLD CARTER BUILDING, HQ OF TIME MACHINE LAB, 2056 A. D. -- NIGHT<br />
<br />
Charles has finally returned to his own time, landing in the experimental lab of Acceleron as he had earlier planned. As he reappears, everything is as it was before he left. As the machine stops and turns off, Charles gingerly, removes himself from the machine. He is bleeding now profusely. Wilhelmina's tourniquet is no longer able to stop the bleeding.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(looking around) So far, everything<br />
<br />
looks back to normal.<br />
<br />
As Charles struggles to walk down the corridor toward the offices and his friends, Ed and the others are coming to meet him, knowing he is finally on his way back from their instrument panels. They spot Charles and notice he's been hurt very badly.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Charlie!!<br />
<br />
Ed rushes to him, as the others, the older Emily, Thomas, George, directly behind. Charles collapses onto the floor, into Ed's arms.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Someone call an ambulance!<br />
<br />
Emily instantly takes off.<br />
<br />
CHARLIE<br />
<br />
(gasping for breath) Is everything<br />
<br />
back the way it was?<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
(confused, looks at others) It's never<br />
<br />
changed.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(fading) Good.<br />
<br />
Emily's back.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
The paramedics are on their way.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It's too late.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
Did you get the computer?<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(shakes head yes) It's in the time<br />
<br />
machine.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
They should still be in the back part<br />
<br />
of the computer.<br />
<br />
THOMAS<br />
<br />
I'll get the Phillips-head.<br />
<br />
George, Thomas instantly take off.<br />
<br />
SOUND: AMBULANCE SIRENS IN THE BACKGROUND.<br />
<br />
INT. -- TIME LABORATORY/ CARTER BUILDING<br />
<br />
Back in the time lab, something stirs in the Rover/time<br />
<br />
machine: Young Charlie. Taking his teddy bear with him, he climbs out of the Rover and slowly starts making his way out<br />
<br />
of the lab, into the corridor. The place looks very strange to him.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Uncle Charles.<br />
<br />
CUT BACK TO:<br />
<br />
CHARLES, THE OTHERS. Just then a man, a bit younger than Charles, yet carrying a striking resemblance to him, enters. He is dressed in the robes and collar of a priest/minister. He wears his cross necklace, along with another, silvery necklace medallion depicting St. Christopher. It's BRYCE KENYON, ADOPTED SON OF ACCELERON PRESIDENT AND CEO, ROSS KENYON. He sees Charles is hurt and hurries to him. Charles's wounds are very bad, bleeding. Bryce begins to administer last rites.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
In the name of the father, the son . . .<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
(nervous, yet delighted) I knew you would<br />
<br />
return.<br />
<br />
As the paramedics enter, they immediately begin their work. Bryce stays with Charles continuing to pray over him. As the two look at each other, Charles sees the striking resemblance.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not<br />
<br />
want. He maketh me to lie down . . .<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Do . . . I know you?<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
You knew my stepfather, Ross Kenyonâ€”and<br />
<br />
my mother, Wilhelmina Jones. You're<br />
<br />
Charles Martel. I recognized you from<br />
<br />
your pictures. I have something that<br />
<br />
belongs to you.<br />
<br />
Bryce pulls out from a pocket the flash drives Wilhelmina took from Charles long ago.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I remember now . . .<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
Mother wanted you to have them when you returned.â€”I also have something else<br />
<br />
that's yours.<br />
<br />
(long beat)<br />
<br />
Charles looks at Bryce, then realizes he is wearing the necklace he gave to Wilhelmina long ago. He reaches out to take it into his hand.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Oh, my God. You're . . . .<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
I'm your son.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
Elated, Charles begins to weep.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(revelation) I . . . have son.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
Don't talk. Let the paramedics do<br />
<br />
their work.<br />
<br />
CUT BACK TO:<br />
<br />
INT. -- CORRIDOR LEADING OUT OF THE TIME LAB<br />
<br />
Young Charlie wanders the corridor looking for his Uncle Charles.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Uncle Charles. Uncle Charles.<br />
<br />
George and Thomas coming down the path to retrieve their disks from the computer spot the lad and are very surprised.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Lord in Heaven!<br />
<br />
Almost speechless, Thomas reacts first.<br />
<br />
THOMAS<br />
<br />
I'll get the disks.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
I'll take the boy.<br />
<br />
George, smiling with delight, goes to Young Charlie, offers him assistance.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Come on, little feller. I'll take you<br />
<br />
to see your Uncle Charlie.<br />
<br />
They begin walking down the corridor to where Charles is together.<br />
<br />
GEORGE<br />
<br />
Would you like some ice cream? I got<br />
<br />
a quart of chocolateâ€”nobody knows about<br />
<br />
stashed away in the freezer.<br />
<br />
CUT BACK TO:<br />
<br />
CHARLES, BRYCE. The paramedics work furiously, but it is in vain. Charles is dying.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Don't leave me.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
I'm not going to leave you.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(astonished, but happy, at peace) I<br />
<br />
have a son. (touches him on the cheek)<br />
<br />
Where's Wilhelmina?<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
She died a long ago--after you disappeared.<br />
<br />
I never really knew her. I was still a<br />
<br />
baby when she died. After he sold the<br />
<br />
television station and became President and<br />
<br />
CEO of Acceleron, Ross raised me as his<br />
<br />
own.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
What about Aunt Agnes?<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
They never married.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
She was some looker, your mother. Just<br />
<br />
like you. And stubborn. Your grandmother<br />
<br />
would have been so happy to know I gave<br />
<br />
her a grandson.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
She knows.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
She's still alive?<br />
<br />
Bryce shakes his head affirmatively.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
Yes. But she never made it to Canada.<br />
<br />
She was in a terrible automobile<br />
<br />
accident on her way to the airport.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(worriedâ€”the timeline ISN'T the same<br />
<br />
as it was) What happened to Charlie?<br />
<br />
What happened to--me?<br />
<br />
Just then George enters with young Charlie still carrying his teddy bear. He spots his Uncle Charles hurt very badly, bleeding. He runs to him, scared, crying with grief. He flings himself onto his 'uncle.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Uncle Charles! Uncle Charles!<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
(sighing, fading, but happy, hugs him)<br />
<br />
It's okay. It's okay. You're alive.<br />
<br />
It's okay.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
You can't die! I need you. Please<br />
<br />
don't die!<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
It's okay. I have to go. Bryce.<br />
<br />
Would you take him?<br />
<br />
Bryce tries to take him away. But Charlie fights him with everything he has.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
No! I won't go! You can't make me!<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
It's okay.â€”Take him.<br />
<br />
As Bryce takes young Charlie into his arms, comforting him,<br />
<br />
Charlie, after awhile, begins to calm down, but continues to cry.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
I'm glad we met--had this time together.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
(comforting Charles) So am Iâ€”Pop. I<br />
<br />
love you.<br />
<br />
CHARLES<br />
<br />
Take care of Charlie for me.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
I will.<br />
<br />
Charles takes one last, contented breath as he longingly gazes into Bryce's eyes, then closes his and dies. Charles continues to cling to Bryce, crying. Bryce tries to comfort him.<br />
<br />
YOUNG CHARLIE<br />
<br />
No! No! Uncle Charles!<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
Charlie. I want you to come with me.<br />
<br />
There's someone I'd like you to meet.<br />
<br />
CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Why did Uncle Charles have to die?<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
I don't know. I can't answer that. But<br />
<br />
I do know he loved you very much and that<br />
<br />
he wanted me to take care of you and<br />
<br />
that's what I'm going to do, starting<br />
<br />
right now.<br />
<br />
As they prepare to leave, the paramedics prepare Charles body for transport.<br />
<br />
ED<br />
<br />
We'll take care of everything here.<br />
<br />
EMILY<br />
<br />
If you need anything.<br />
<br />
Bryce nods a grateful thank-you and exits with Charlie in his arms.<br />
<br />
TIME LAPSE.<br />
<br />
DISSOLVE TO:<br />
<br />
EXT. -- SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME -- DAY<br />
<br />
Bryce and Charlie arrive at the nursing home.<br />
<br />
INT. -- CORRIDOR LEADING TO KATHRYN'S ROOM<br />
<br />
As they enter, POV SHOT, Bryce sees Kathryn sitting in her rocking chair staring out the big picture window toward the gardens. A nurse is, at the moment, attending to her needs. Seeing Bryce with Young Charlie, she immediately leaves to give them some privacy with Kathryn.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
Grandmother?<br />
<br />
Slowly, Kathryn's eyes turn towards Bryce's. They are full of tears and sorrow. Her face is horribly scarred by her accident long ago.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
I'd like you to meet someone.<br />
<br />
CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Is she my grandmother, too?<br />
<br />
Recognizing her son's voice, her eyes suddenly light up with surprise and delight. She turns them to find her boy still alive and wellâ€”as he was long ago. She beckons the boy to come into her arms. Charlie goes to her. She hugs him for all she's worth, he hugs her back, as she cradles him in her arms and rocks him like she used to when he was just a baby.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
Great grandmother, Charlie. For now,<br />
<br />
that's all you need to know.<br />
<br />
CHARLIE<br />
<br />
Great grandma.<br />
<br />
Kathryn looks up and smiles a smile of deep abiding peace at Bryce. Happy again, she is fulfilled knowing she has her sonâ€”her life back again.<br />
<br />
KATHRYN<br />
<br />
Oh, Charlie. I didn't lose you after<br />
<br />
all.<br />
<br />
Kathryn mouths the words, 'Thank you,' to Bryce as he kneels beside her chair. He pets Charlie lovingly.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
I'll leave you two alone for a while to<br />
<br />
get re-acquainted.<br />
<br />
As Bryce exits the room . . .<br />
<br />
INT. -- NURSING HOME CORRIDOR<br />
<br />
. . . he walks the corridor . . .<br />
<br />
INT. -- COMMON LIVING AREA<br />
<br />
. . . to the common living area. He walks to the large picture window in the living room that also overlooks the gardens. He is at peace, knowing he has finally met his true father.<br />
<br />
(beat)<br />
<br />
As he stands gazing out toward the skies, a pair of gentle, loving arms wrap around him. He caresses them back lovingly and smiles. IT IS WILHELMINA NOW IN HER SIXTIES. She gives her son a gentle kiss.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
God, forgive me. I lied to him, Mother.<br />
<br />
I told him you had died a long time ago.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
I didâ€”when he never came back for me--us.<br />
<br />
But now, I understand why. It's just as<br />
<br />
well. He was never really mine anyway.<br />
<br />
And now he belongs to God.<br />
<br />
BRYCE<br />
<br />
We will see him again someday.<br />
<br />
WILHELMINA<br />
<br />
In this brave new world--and with your<br />
<br />
faith, I don't doubt it one day we shall<br />
<br />
my baby.--I don't doubt it one bi--at all.<br />
<br />
Wilhelmina smiles contentedly as she loves her son and he her.<br />
<br />
CAMERA SHOT: YOUNG CHARLIE BEING GENTLY ROCKED IN KATHRYN'S ARMS.<br />
