								<div class="bbWrapper">TESLA'S DYNAMIC THEORY OF GRAVITY:<br />
How the engineers of the Project Rainbow, Traveled in Time! <br />
<br />
&quot;According to Tesla's lecture prepared for the Institute of Immigrant Welfare (May. 12, 1938), his &quot;Dynamic Theory of Gravity&quot; was one of two far reaching discoveries, which he &quot;...worked out in all details&quot;, in the years 1893 and 1894. The 1938 lecture was less than five years before his death. More complete statements concerning these discoveries can only be gleaned from scattered and sparse sources, because the papers of Tesla are concealed in government vaults for &quot;national security&quot; reasons. When I specifically asked for these papers at the &quot;National Security Research Center&quot; - now the &quot;Robert J. Oppenheimer Research Center&quot; - in 1979, I was denied access because they were classified, even though on that same day I discovered the plans for the hydrogen bomb on an open shelf, and told a Harvard graduate student about it later in the day at a Santa Fe restaurant. The guy went to Los Alamos, copied the plans, and wrote an expose at Harvard. In his 1938 lecture, Tesla said he was progressing with the work, and hoped to give the theory to the world &quot;very soon&quot;, so it was clearly his intent to &quot;give it to the world&quot;, as soon as he had completed his secret developments. The &quot;two great discoveries&quot; to which Tesla referred, were: 1. The Dynamic Theory of Gravity - which assumed a field of force which accounts for the motions of bodies in space; assumption of this field of force dispenses with the concept of space curvature (ala Einstein); the ether has an indispensable function in the phenomena (of universal gravity, inertia, momentum, and movement of heavenly bodies, as well as all atomic and molecular matter); and, 2. Environmental Energy - the Discovery of a new physical Truth: there is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment. The usual Tesla birthday announcement - on his 79th birthday (1935) - Tesla made a brief reference to the theory saying it applies to molecules and atoms as well as to the largest heavenly bodies, and to &quot;...all matter in the universe in any phase of its existence from its very formation to its ultimate disintegration&quot;. Those imbued with relativist theory often refer to &quot;pure energy&quot; in some &quot;form&quot;, but there is no such thing, since &quot;energy&quot; is an abstract &quot;ability&quot; which is always in the future. Who's to say what &quot;form&quot; is &quot;pure&quot;, and what form is not? My favorite philosopher, Ayn Rand, said. &quot;In reality, there are no contradictions. Things are what they are irrespective as to whether we know it or not. Check your premises.&quot; If the term &quot;energy&quot; is only a convenient abstraction, then it does not exist in physical form, and really describes the potential to perform work as a by-product of matter and electromagnetic radiation in perpetual motion, some of the force of which has been diverted through a path where it performs the desired work, as it goes on its merry way through the universe. Every change of form of either matter or radiation involves the &quot;work&quot; which induces the change, or the &quot;work&quot; which is induced by the change. Without work there is no change, but all work is ultimately the product of the universe in perpetual, self-sustaining motion, as a rule and not an exception. As for Tesla's theory, we have hints, such as, that the earth is the &quot;star of human birth&quot;. In poetic expressions, he hid scientific meanings in statements such as, that using the &quot;thunderbolt of Jove&quot; (the Indo-European sky god), man &quot;annihilates time and space&quot;, an allusion to the use of electro-propulsion (&quot;thunderbolts&quot;), to travel so fast, that time and space are &quot;annihilated&quot;. Where the government has stolen his papers, we must search for meaning elsewhere. In an article, &quot;Man's Greatest Achievement&quot;, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity in poetic form (as paraphrased by me): * That the luminiferous ether fills all space * That the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force * That the ether is thrown into &quot;infinitesimal whirls&quot; (&quot;micro helices&quot;) at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter * That when the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of &quot;atomic decay&quot;) That man can harness these processes, to: -Precipitate matter from the ether -Create whatever he wants with the matter and energy derived -Alter the earth's size -Control earth's seasons (weather control) -Guide earth's path through the Universe, like a space ship -Cause the collisions of planets to produce new suns and stars, heat, and light -Originate and develop life in infinite forms Tesla was referring to unlimited energy, derived from the environment. Several of his major free energy discoveries have been the exclusive stolen property of our Secret Government. The conversion of energy to a stronger force - electropulsion - used to control the much weaker gravity force, would accomplish more work in the same amount of time, and produce &quot;over unity&quot; results. Some of Telsa's unusual conceptualization of the ether had been nonetheless expounded piecemeal, in his preceding 1890's lectures. He later railed against the limited and erroneous theories of Maxwell, Hertz, Lorentz, and Einstein. Tesla's ether was neither the &quot;solid&quot; ether with the &quot;tenuity of steel&quot; of Maxwell and Hertz, nor the half-hearted, entrained, gaseous ether of Lorentz. Tesla's ether consisted of &quot;carriers immersed in an insulating fluid&quot;, which filled all space. Its properties varied according to relative movement, the presence of mass, and the electric and magnetic environment. Tesla's ether was rigidified by rapidly varying electrostatic forces, and was thereby involved in gravitational effects, inertia, and momentum, especially in the space near earth, since, as explained by Tesla, the earth is &quot;...like a charged metal ball moving through space&quot;, which creates the enormous, rapidly varying electrostatic forces which diminish in intensity with the square of the distance from earth, just like gravity. Since the direction of propagation radiates from the earth, the so-called force of gravity is toward earth. Tesla commenced to complete his Dynamic Theory of Gravity at the same approximate period of time that his experimental results and theories had been revealed in the three lectures, often illustrated with demonstrations using Tesla-invented equipment, as revealed in the following eight excerpts, in pertinent part (emphasis mine): 1. &quot;The most probable medium filling the space is one consisting of independent carriers immersed in an insulating fluid&quot;. 2. &quot;In his experiments he dwells first on some phenomena produced by electrostatic force, which he considers in the light of modern theories to be the most important force in nature for us to investigate.&quot; 3. &quot;He illustrates how mechanical motions are produced by a varying electrostatic force acting through a gaseous medium.&quot; 4. &quot;One of the most interesting results arrived at in pursuing these experiments, is the demonstration of the fact that a gaseous medium upon which vibration is impressed by rapid changes of electrostatic potential, is rigid&quot;. 5. &quot;If through this medium enormous electrostatic stresses are assumed to act, which vary rapidly in intensity, it would allow the motion of a body through it, yet it would be rigid and elastic, although the fluid itself might be devoid of these properties&quot;. 6. &quot;...on the assumption that the independent carriers are of any configuration such that the fluid resistance to motion in one direction is greater than in another, a stress of that nature would cause the carriers to arrange themselves in groups, since they would turn to each other their sides of the greatest electrical density, in which position the fluid resistance to approach would be smaller than to receding.&quot; 7. &quot;If in a medium of the above characteristics a brush would be formed by a steady potential, an exchange of the carriers would go on continuously, and there would be less carriers per unit volume in the brush than in the space at some distance from the electrode, this corresponding to rarefaction&quot;. 8. &quot;If the potentials were rapidly changing, the result would be very different; the higher the frequency of the pulses, the slower would be the exchange of carriers; finally, the motion of translation through measurable space would cease and, with a sufficiently high frequency and intensity of the stress, the carriers would be drawn towards the electrode, and compression would result.&quot; The eight above excerpts are further reducible to the following four statements pertinent to electro-propulsion technology: 1. Mechanical motions can be produced by varying electrostatic force acting through a gaseous (ether) medium, which thereby becomes rigidifled, yet allows solid bodies to pass through. 2. Under influence of stress in one direction (under the polarizing influence of light or heat), the carriers may group together, forming tubes of force, creating greater ease of movement in that direction. 3. When a (D.C.) brush is created by a steady potential, a continuous exchange of carriers is created corresponding to ether rarefaction, as the tubes of force are drawn into the conductor. 4. With a sufficiently high frequency and stress intensity in the opposite direction, carrier exchange is blocked by ether compression, forcing the tubes of force to dissolve in the conductors of the ship, imparting electromagnetic momentum. The system, using the two kinds of potentials (D.C. and A.C.), is known as &quot;p2&quot;. The steady potential of the brush creates the required exchange of carriers, 'rarifying' (stretching) the elastic, rigidified medium (composed of the carriers immersed in the insulating fluid) in advance of the ship, as the high frequency A.C. to the rear compresses them, blocking exchange from the rear, dissolving the tubes of force (my &quot;microhelices&quot;), creating instant momentum, normal to the surface (which is at right angles to the electric and magnetic fields). In 1884, John Henry Poynting's theorem had been that the flux of energy at any place is represented by the vector product of the electric and magnetic forces, multiplied by C/4(pi symbol) 3rd power. This implied that forces in a conductor could be transformed there into other forms. In 1893, J. J. Thomson stated practically the same thing, saying &quot;...the aether is itself the vehicle of mechanical momentum, of amount (l/4 (pi symbol)C (D*B) per unit volume. (Using e.-s. Units for D and E and e.-m. Units for B and H.) E = electrical force D = electrical displacement H = magnetic force B = magnetic induction Heinrich Hertz's theory was that two systems of varying current should exert a ponderomotive force on each other due to the variations. Tesla's disagreement was apparently based on the fact that he proved that the &quot;ponderomotive force&quot; is due not to mere &quot;varying currents&quot;; but to rarefaction and compression of the ether carriers, respectively, produced by different kinds of currents (D.C., A.C., rapidly varying electrostatic). J.J. Thomson had extensively developed the theory of the moving tubes of force, both magnetic and electric, saying that the magnetic effect was a secondary one created by the movement of electric tubes, and assumed: * that tubes exist everywhere in space, either in closed circuits or terminating on atoms; * that electric force becomes perceivable only when electric tubes have greater tendency to lie in one direction; * that in a steady magnetic field, positive and negative tubes may move in opposite directions with equal velocity; * that a beam of light is a group of electric tubes moving at C at right angles to their length (providing a good explanation for polarization of the plane of rotation). Tesla said his &quot;dirigible torpedo&quot; would fly at a maximum 300 miles per second, perhaps since its forward velocity would be some maximum fraction of C. Thomson's later publishings on this subject followed Tesla's 1891 lectures before the Royal Society in London, and appear to shed light on Tesla's work, stating: * that a ponderomotive force is exerted on a conductor carrying electric current, consisting of a transfer of mechanical momentum from the agent which exerts the force to the body which experiences it; * that, if moving tubes entering a conductor are dissolved in it, mechanical momentum is given to the conductor; * that such momentum must be at right angles to the tube and to the magnetic induction; * that momentum stored in a unit volume of the field is proportional to the vector product of electric and magnetic vectors. &quot;Thomson's&quot; &quot;Electromagnetic Momentum&quot; hypothesis was later developed by H. Poincare' and by M. Abraham. By 1910, it was said that the consequence of these pronouncements left three alternatives: 1. Modify the theory to reduce to zero the resultant force on an element of free aether (as with Maxwell, Hertz, and Einstein); 2. Assume the force sets aether in motion (as with Helmholtz); 3. Accept the principle that aether is the vehicle of mechanical momentum of amount &lt;D*B&gt; per unit volume (as with Poynting and J. J. Thomson). Whittaker's greatest error was in omitting Tesla's theory entirely. After Tesla's experiments verified it, right in front of the esteemed members of the &quot;Royal Academy&quot;, the &quot;three (later) alternatives&quot; were moot, and a new law existed, that of Tesla. Tesla's Secrecy Due to his pacifist sympathies, Tesla originally contemplated giving his electric flying machine to the Geneva Convention or League of Nations, for use in 'policing the world' to prevent war. Later disillusioned after WWI with the collapse of the League, he said he'd &quot;...underestimated man's combative capacity&quot;. In 1919, his reason for increased secrecy emerged in an interview with Frederick M. Kerby, for &quot;Resolution&quot; magazine, while discussing a &quot;three-hour&quot; airplane between New York and London: &quot;...we have here the appalling prospect of a war between nations at a distance of thousands of miles, with weapons so destructive and demoralizing that the world could not endure them. That is why there must be no more war.&quot; With the government's spurning of his defense suggestions, Tesla's only recourse was to withhold his secrets from the world, and to dissuade discovery in their direction. In 1929, Tesla ridiculed Heinrich Hertz's 1887-89 experiments purportedly proving the Maxwellian &quot;structureless&quot; ether filling all space, &quot;of inconceivable tenuity yet solid and possessed of rigidity incomparably greater than the hardest steel&quot;. Tesla's arguments were to the contrary, saying he had always believed in a &quot;gaseous&quot; ether in which he had observed waves more akin to sound waves. He recounted how he had developed a &quot;new form of vacuum tube&quot; in 1896 (which I call the &quot;Tesla bulb&quot;), &quot;...capable of being charged to any desired potential, and operated it with effective pressures of about 4,000,000 volts.&quot; He described how purplish coronal discharges about the bulb when in use, verified the existence of &quot;particles smaller than air&quot;, and a gas so light that an earth-sized volume would weigh only 1/20 pound. He further said sound waves moved at the velocity of light through this medium. Tesla mentioned using his special tube to investigate cosmic rays, saying that when its emanations were impinged upon a target material, radioactive emissions resulted, and that radioactive bodies were simply &quot;targets&quot; continuously bombarded by &quot;infinitesimal bullets projected from all parts of the universe&quot;, without which &quot;all radioactivity would cease.&quot; His description of these &quot;bullets&quot; was similar to the ZPR. On Apr. 15, 1932, Tesla said Einstein's theory regarding changing matter into force, and force into matter, was &quot;absurd&quot;. He compared this to the difference between body and mind, saying force is a &quot;...function of matter&quot;, and that, just as a mind could not exist without a body, &quot;...without matter, there can be no force.&quot; On Sept. 11, 1932 (New York Herald Tribune), Tesla derided the Maxwellian/Hertzian ether, while saying that higher frequency waves &quot;...follow the curvature of the earth and bend around obstacles&quot;, yet in an Apr. 8, 1934 New York Times letter, said that short waves for &quot;power purposes&quot; of the 'wireless art', were inappropriate, and that power will travel in &quot;long waves&quot;. His 1929 attack on the Maxwellian/Hertzian ether theory - 39 years afterward, during the advent of Relativism - seemed relevant only to his concealed theory, not to disclose it or promote it, but to conceal it. THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY What were the old ether physicists referring to when they attempted to describe &quot;an incompressible, perfect fluid&quot;? What would a &quot;perfect fluid&quot; do? It would be able to &quot;wet&quot; everything it came into contact with, such as protons, and could flow everywhere without resistance. One &quot;fluid&quot; - the ether - could flow everywhere, and because of its density and ultra-fineness, nothing could stop it, and it felt no resistance, but only matter felt resistance, depending on the circumstances. Another fluid - electricity - could flow in certain places, and wet only certain things, but often met resistance. In order to understand the ether, we must get to know electricity more intimately. Just like water, a proton will hold only so much electricity on its surface, but the 'surface' of the proton is probably similar to the outer area of a ball-shaped swarm of hovering mechanical bees, powered by the ZPR, with a denser agglomeration of &quot;bees&quot; toward the 'ball's' center. If this swarm of bees is subjected to a wave of rainy mist (the etheric 'wind'), the bees must all turn to face into the etheric wind to maintain their formation. The 'water' droplets - electric sub-charges carried by the etheric wind - tend to agglomerate around the front side. Each bee, as he flaps his wings, will get wet only so much, so that excess 'water' is thrown off and carried to the next bee, or the next swarm of bees, by the etheric wind, and so forth, so that a 'current' of droplets continues to flow through the ball of bees due to its motion through the etheric wind, and transfers momentum between masses. The 'water' tends to come off in larger drops, which have formed from smaller droplets accumulated on each bee. As in fluid mechanics, the 'drop' size is the result of cohesiveness of the electric 'fluid', the surface area of each 'bee', and the space between each bee, all of which influences the final size of each larger 'drop' (the &quot;electron&quot;) which accumulates enough to form it. If one were to mathematically analyze the flow of &quot;drops&quot; (i.e., &quot;quanta&quot;) per mass unit, they would have an average rate of the flow of charges/cm3 of etheric wind, for the momentum, as determined by the &quot;current&quot; flow rate. Much like the bees, as a body (its many electrons, atoms, and molecules, with plenty of 'space' within and between) sits at rest on the earth, it moves at fantastic speed through the universal ether field, due to the earth's revolution, orbit, and other motions. In his 1891 A.I.E.E. lecture at Columbia College, Tesla said in pertinent part (emphasis mine): &quot;What is electricity, and what is magnetism? &quot;...We are now confident that electric and magnetic phenomena are attributable to the ether, and we are perhaps justified in saying that the effects of static electricity are effects of ether in motion&quot;. &quot;...we may speak of electricity or of an electric condition, state or effect&quot;. &quot;...we must distinguish two such effects, opposite in character neutralizing each other&quot;. &quot;...for in a medium of the properties of the ether, we cannot possibly exert a strain, or produce a displacement or motion of any kind, without causing in the surrounding medium an equivalent and opposite effect.&quot; &quot;...its condition determines the positive and negative character.&quot; &quot;We know that it acts like an incompressible fluid;&quot; &quot;...the electro-magnetic theory of light and all facts observed teach us that electric and ether phenomena are identical.&quot; &quot;The puzzling behavior of the ether as a solid to waves of light and heat, and as a fluid to the motion of bodies through it, is certainly explained in the most natural and satisfactory manner by assuming it to be in motion, as Sir William Thomson has suggested.&quot; &quot;Nor can anyone prove that there are transverse ether waves emitted from an alternate current machine; to such slow disturbances, the ether, if at rest, may behave as a true fluid.&quot; In his statements, Tesla was balancing the various arguments in preparation for his decision: &quot;...Electricity, therefore, cannot be called ether in the broad sense of the term; but nothing would seem to stand in the way of calling electricity ether associated with matter, or bound ether; or, in other words, that the so-called static charge of the molecule is ether associated in some way with the molecule.&quot; &quot;...It cannot differ in density, ether being incompressible: it must, therefore, be under some strain or in motion, and the latter is the most probable.&quot; Tesla therefore believed in an ether which was in motion relative to earth, because the earth is in motion. The thing which Tesla had realized, was that ether possesses electric charges which are deposited on atoms. In supporting the &quot;dynamic&quot; ether concept, he was supporting the &quot;stationary ether&quot; concept, since the &quot;motion&quot; he referred to was &quot;apparent&quot; motion of the ether perceived by an observer on earth, relative to a stationary ether. The importance of cosmic motion to the electromagnetic effects of static charges was brought up by Tesla in his lecture: &quot;About fifteen years ago, Prof. Rowland demonstrated a most interesting and important fact, namely, that a static charge carried around produces the effects of an electric current.&quot; &quot;...and conceiving the electrostatically charged molecules in motion, this experimental fact gives us a fair idea of magnetism. We can conceive lines or tubes of force which physically exist, being formed of rows of directed moving molecules; we can see that these lines must be closed, that they must tend to shorten and expand, etc. It likewise explains in a reasonable way, the most puzzling phenomenon of all, permanent magnetism, and, in general, has all the beauties of the Ampere theory without possessing the vital defect of the same, namely, the assumption of molecular currents. Without enlarging further upon the subject, I would say, that I look upon all electrostatic, current and magnetic phenomena as being due to electrostatic molecular forces.&quot; In these statements, Tesla showed he was aware that any &quot;stationary&quot; locale on earth is actually in fantastic motion (&quot;70,000 mph&quot;). The electrostatic charges &quot;carried around&quot; are currents between atoms and the ether, which produce magnetism. The phenomena of 'permanent magnetism' or 'cosmically induced' magnetism are apparently due to electrostatic charges 'carried around' by cosmic motion, in the universal ether field. Since no one can hold an atom or molecule perfectly still---because it is in fantastic motion---all atoms and molecules carry currents producing magnetic fields. Since a magnetic field is the product of a current, no one can produce a magnetic field without electricity, moving through or along a conductor, or as electrostatic charges in local or cosmic motion. Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity and MHD method of Spacial Electropulsion brought a cosmic crowning achievement to the works of Faraday, Wm. Thomson, J. J. Thomson, and Edmund Hall. CONCLUSION The ether is a universal medium, which fills all space. It appears to be &quot;dynamic&quot; relative to an earth moving thousands of miles per hour through space. The ether is normally electrically neutral, ultra-fine, and penetrates all solid matter. There is also an ultra high frequency, ubiquitous radiation, normally in equilibrium, called Zero Point Radiation (&quot;ZPR&quot;), which interpenetrates the ether, and represents electromagnetic radiation in its finest, densest form, which, in conjunction with the ether, conserves universal perpetual motion. The ether in conjunction with the ZPR, is the source of all matter and force. &quot;Energy&quot; does not exist in physical form, but is &quot;the ability to do work&quot;, which is equal to &quot;force over time&quot;. The word &quot;energy&quot; is a convenient fiction, like &quot;time&quot;, which is an arbitrary measurement of the rate of motion of matter through ether-filled space. All events occur in the present, and the &quot;past&quot; and &quot;future&quot; are merely metaphors. Electromagnetic disturbances in the ether extract &quot;energy&quot; from the ZPR, which is explainable only by an ether theory. This &quot;free energy&quot;, which is virtually unlimited, is universally at work, created by the perpetual motion of matter, and the perpetual exchange of stronger and weaker forces, through which the equilibrium of the universe is maintained, the sum total of all processes equaling zero. Since all solid matter is continually hurling through space, always in motion, it is always subjected to the &quot;etheric wind&quot; and ZPR interactions. These effects are not perceived except during changes in the orientation of mass or its velocity. All mass and space have dielectric properties. Differences in dielectric properties cause changes in the electromagnetic displacement within mass and the etheric wind. Earth's electric field creates dielectric displacement effects within ether and mass within earth's electric field. The difference between the dielectric displacement within a mass and the dielectric displacement outside the mass in the etheric wind, creates a down-force in the direction of the negative polarity, as the etheric wind 'blows' through a mass. This is called &quot;gravity&quot;. Since all mass is in motion, all mass has momentum, even when apparently &quot;at rest&quot; relative to earth. Momentum is a body's resistance to change in its state of motion. Since inertia is also the resistance of a body to changes in its momentum, inertia and momentum are due to the same thing, the resistance of electromagnetic micro helical tubules to changes in velocity (and relative &quot;pitch&quot;), direction, and lateral motions or orientation. Since all space and mass is composed only of &quot;electric content&quot;, momentum/inertia is electromagnetic in nature, and can be electromagnetically synthesized. All mass contains electrostatic charges, which when &quot;carried around&quot; in the ether/ZPR-filled space by celestial or 'local' movement, constitute currents. These currents actually flow between mass and the ether, and are integral to the mechanism by which momentum is imparted to mass in motion. The currents create magnetic fields as their equal-and-opposite counterparts, and give a rotatory motion to combined, bi-directional electric and magnetic fields and currents, around irrotational vacuous ether cores. This rotatory electromagnetic action creates momentum, as the force-free &quot;screw-type&quot; reaction within mass, creating its motion relative to the ether cores, from which the mechanical force is transferred to the atomic mass with which the electromagnetism is associated. Since these phenomena are electromagnetic in nature, they are synthesized by recreation of the electromagnetic conditions which a body would exhibit due to a particular kinetic state. Just as electromagnetic waves of low frequency can penetrate a body, waves of higher frequencies - above I.R. and below U.V.- can cause the ether to &quot;assert its inertia resistance&quot;. The technology involves high voltage D.C. 'brush' currents, high frequency currents, rapidly varying electrostatic forces, and light/heat beams. The rapidly varying electrostatic forces &quot;rarify&quot; (stretch) the ether carriers, as the light/heat beams polarize the medium in the desired direction, as the D.C. brush currents induce the exchange of carriers, creating a vacuum in that direction, inducing motion. At the opposite end of the ship, high frequency currents draw the carriers through the ship, and creates a compression of the ether, as it penetrates the solid mass and synthesizes the rotatory micro helical tubules, which whirl around the ether cores along the polar axis, at a pitch corresponding to a particular rate of momentum. Since the strength of the electromagnetic interaction is 10/40 time greater than the gravitational interaction, that much more work can theoretically be done in the same time, using the same &quot;energy&quot;. Since &quot;seeing is believing&quot;, and I have seen, I believe. The behavior of man-made flying saucers proves the existence of these &quot;free energy&quot; inventions of Nikola Tesla, which show that he was right in his opposition to Relativism, and that the prevalent theories taught in the scientific institutions of the world are patently _fraudulent_. Consistent with the idea that &quot;dynamite comes in small packages&quot;, this small book, along with my prior book, &quot;Space Aliens From the Pentagon,&quot; initiates the rediscovery, reconstruction and publication of Nikola Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity and related electropulsion technology, the greatest invention of mankind. The Secret Government - a fraudulently concealed, unconstitutional, corporate-state entity - has heretofore controlled electropulsion technology by concealing it and other advanced... -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------- <br />
I see that some us us here have been taking the &quot;Time&quot; out to catch up on some reading to add to their research, especially &quot;Nicola Tesla's &quot; works Good Job people We should have listened to Tesla 100 yrs. ago, and not allowed our GVT to ruin him in the first place, because if we would have done so, we would have become much more advanced on the open frontier, as opposed to behind hidden doors of secret powers trying to rule the world. To those of you who are attempting to absorb the unlimited overunity power of free energy, and extract it from the aether, I will post something here that might be of use..... xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Dear Tom, ... A couple of questions, if I may: Remember in your older books, like Fer De Lance, etc., when you mentioned Frank Golden's ability to monitor the 12 KHz frequency pairs that the Soviets were using to extract power from the earth, etc? Now that it has been so many years down the road, and you yourself have essentially moved on to other things, can you elaborate on any of the actual equipment that was being used? Like his scalar EM receiver, or the time the two of you used scalar transmitters to charge up an area and the clocks went haywire... If only some of us could have some info on how to get started on some of these devices, we could possibly have undeniable proof that it's all more than just conceptual. <a href="http://www.tricountyi.net/~rande...ndiscl.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">www.tricountyi.net/~rande...ndiscl.htm</a> Here is the point: If Bearden is correct in his Scalar EM theory, then we can build devices which would enable us to alter gravity, time, inertia, and the apparent mass of an object. This of course has ENORMOUS implications for military applications, space-vehicle drives, time- travel, teleportation, paranormal phenomena, and just about every other area one can think of. The Big Question is, Will the 21st century see the acceptance, development, and implementation of Bearden's ideas (in plain public view, mind you), or will Scalar EM be found to have been just another dead end?.... Do certain world governments have these devices NOW?... Bearden says at least &quot;three other nations, not hostile to the U.S.,&quot; now possess Scalar technology. Files on SCALAR ELECTROMAGNETICS <a href="http://www.tricountyi.net/~rande...lrmenu.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">www.tricountyi.net/~rande...lrmenu.htm</a><br />
------------------------------------------------------------- ---This area, in my opinion, ties much of the information together from the other areas on this web site. Tom Bearden's Scalar EM may be the New Electromagnetics of the 21st century... if we can get him to spill the beans on some specific methodologies and circuitry! In the meantime, we continue to collect, compile, speculate on, and critique his theories, in the hope that some light will be generated along with all the heat. <br />
