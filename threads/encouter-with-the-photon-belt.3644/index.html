<br />
globalnet.co.uk<br />
November 23, 2005<br />
<br />
By means of satellite instrumentation, astronomers in 1961 discovered what appeared to be an unusual nebula. We normally understand the nebula phenomenon as a vast cloud-like mass of gas or dust. This one, however, appeared to have anomalous properties and was named the Golden Nebula. The public´s attention was not drawn to this unusual revelation until much later, presumably when it was realised that this nebula´s location was coincident with the projected orbit of our solar system. Around the early 1980s a radio announcement in the U.S. was made (heard by the author) that our solar system was, in fact, going to collide with an ´electromagnetic cloud´ in the not too distant future. This incredibly important statement of astronomical and historical significance was expressed in the usual casual and indifferent manner as though of little consequence--just as was, about that time, the announcement that the FDIC (bank-depositor´s insurance) was penniless! Follow-up data was then suppressed and another government cover-up was contrived for the typical purpose of exploiting where possible natural events to camouflage contrived chaos.<br />
<br />
What is this electromagnetic cloud, this golden nebula, sometimes referred to as the radiant nebula by ETs? Its more universal designation is ´photon belt´ or ´photon band´, consisting of many bands, and any encounter with this belt is recognised by extraterrestrials as of great import. It is in fact referred to by more enlightened ETs as a ´planetary trouble shooter´.<br />
<br />
Let us outline the mechanics of this anticipated encounter of our solar system with the photon belt. The whole universe is held together by means of vortices within vortices of centripetal energy--with their associated electromagnetic fields--like whirlpools on water, within larger whirlpools (this is the machinery behind Einstein´s spacetime topology of general relativity). These spiralling energies give rise to natural spacetime orbits: satellites around planets, planets around stars, solar systems around other more major vortex centres, and so on. Our planet Earth orbits the Sun once a year but our solar system as a whole also traverses an orbit in this section of the galaxy with a period of about 24,000 years. There are many other solar (star) systems in this cyclic motion (just as there are numerous planets orbiting the Sun). The Pleiades, which is encircled by the photon belt, is about 400 light years from us, and is part of this system and in fact our solar system orbits the central sun of the Pleiades, Alcyone. The belt consists of many photon bands emanating from the centre of the galaxy, and associated with the spiral arms of the galaxy.<br />
<br />
Thus our solar system, and therefore planet Earth, takes some 24,000 years to come back to its same point in this particular orbit. Picture several star systems in a massive orbit, but now envisage overall a toroid or doughnut-shaped cloud cutting across these orbiting star systems. It is also described as an amoeba-like cloud of particles but most of its frequencies are invisible. This is the photon belt, or photon band. This means our solar system goes through the belt twice each cycle of 24,000 years (that is, every half cycle). The thickness of the photon cloud is such that technically it takes about 2000 years for our solar system to pass through, and therefore about 10,000 years between each encounter with this belt (2 x 10,000 plus 2 x 2000 = 24,000 years). Nevertheless, some sources state that the period in the band could be much less: 30 to 40 years, depending on man´s resistance to change. This is difficult to relate to our fixed cyclic picture but, in addition, this same source points out that Earth was in trouble from the damage incurred by our civilisation and called for the photon belt--a typical emergency call procedure for planets. The fact that the ´call´ was synchronous with the orbital position merely indicates the higher plans--that the big picture would already have matters organised to happen in that way. This ´call´ occurred in 1947 and manifested as a signal which could have been monitored on the AM band, producing a clicking sound--see Robert Shapiro´s Explorer Race and Shining The Light series of books.<br />
<br />
When will this interaction occur? Scientists around the globe in 1992 predicted that the encounter would occur within months to a year; with significant disagreements. A particular source of Pleiadian extraterrestrials indicated that it would not occur until just after 2010 and that it was difficult to predict since the belt was oscillating randomly. There have been in fact huge discrepancies in channeled material regarding the date of this revelatory occurrence, ranging from 1987 to ´definitely before the end of this century´ to 2003 and finally about 2011-2012. Other Pleiadians tell us that our solar system skimmed the belt for a few days in 1987, then contacted it for over a week in the following year, increasing the degree of entry each year, and then the Sun went in fully in 1998. The information indicates that Earth does not enter fully until 2012. At the present time we are being informed that the Earth is in the belt (for the period December, 1998 and June, 1999). The belt does, however, have an outer aura which we enter first, and we are not expected to experience the full-blown effects until 2012.<br />
<br />
What does the photon belt consist of? What will be its effects on the life on our planet, positive or negative? Also what is its purpose, if any? The radio announcement used the term ´electromagnetic´ to describe the phenomenon--this is the same as photon, which is a particle of light or electromagnetic radiation.<br />
<br />
The photon belt is an immense region of space which is radiating intense electromagnetic radiation throughout the visible spectrum and beyond, into high-frequency invisible light; even including some x-ray spectra. It is part of a magnetic flow of light throughout the galaxy. Reference has already been made through the media to huge increases in intensity of ´dangerous´ radiation entering through the holes in the ozone layer in certain regions of our planet.<br />
<br />
It appears that for mankind on this planet the photon belt encounter will be essentially a spiritual experience--but this really depends on man. Nevertheless, the real benefits of this phenomenon is from what is actually causing the photons. It is linked with the so-called convergences. If we are sufficiently evolved at the time, great advancements will occur in our consciousness as we attune to the higher-frequencies. If we are negative, that is, possess too many lower vibrations, the result of selfish actions, we are not expected to survive the frequency incompatibility.<br />
<br />
The convergence is the end of a stellar activation cycle--this is explained in detail in Anna Hayes´ material. Thus, what causes the photon belt? The stellar activations have already begun and will continue through 2012 to 2017. The principle time cycle is 26,556 years, which is the precession of the equinoxes and is caused by a slow wobble of the Earth as it spins and orbits around the Sun. This is known by astronomers. Note that this period is not to be confused with the 24,000 (or so) year cycle in which our solar system orbits Alcyone.<br />
<br />
Stellar activation occurs when our solar system lines up with the higher frequency bands of Pleiades (star Alcyone), Sirius, Arcturus, Orion, and Andromeda. The frequency bands then merge and pass through Earth. If Earth is out of balance within itself due to abuse from invader ETs, the illuminati, and Earthman´s behaviour, the higher frequencies will cause an ´Armageddon´.<br />
<br />
To understand the alignment, one could think of circles within circles (cycles within cycles) turning at different rates to which are attached magnets. Clearly, periodically they could line up, forming one long and powerful magnet. This would act like a powerful current. It is called a holographic beam since it contains the fundamental energy of these systems.<br />
<br />
After the convergence, this holographic beam carries the remains of photon activity. When Earth is in alignment, it merges with higher-dimensional parallel Earth, Tara. During this process the particles and antiparticles of these planets and their antiparallel planets are unified in certain specific ways. When these particles and antiparticles come together they create intense photonic activity which we know as the photon belt. It is continually renewed each cycle as the holographic beam passes out through Alcyone, leaving the band around this star.<br />
<br />
As implied, there will be a natural spiritual selection. In the initial stages of the photon-belt encounter only sensitives will detect anything strange but when we enter fully, even the most hardened individuals will receive the full effects. Both great illumination of consciousness will occur and great resistance to new ideas. This is a period of awakening essentially due to the ascension cycle and planetary alignment. What proportion of effects are directly due to the belt is difficult to say. Nevertheless this phenomenon of both the photon belt plus stellar activity will reduce the veil stopping us from seeing who we are. It will remove some of the barriers around cells and DNA making them more reactive or responsive to new energies, and in fact the DNA will attempt to respond to the changing frequencies, increasing its capacity.<br />
<br />
Psychological characteristics of entering the belt are the effect of uprooting hidden, secret, or withheld material, bringing it to the surface for transmutation. This means psychological and physical disease patterns will be forced to the surface, that is, the conscious mind. This will give tremendous opportunity to make advancements but also where there is too much to handle will cause illness, depressions, disease and death.<br />
<br />
More advanced viewpoints see the photon band as a being, a consciousness, which essentially has a ´personality´ for change and action. It presents opportunities for change on a planet by adding new energies. It increases the flow of energy in the magnetic grids of Earth, attracting new ideas and energies. People will feel the need to transform but those who consider this physical reality their only expression will dwindle into greater fixations, blocks and negativity. Nevertheless it aids eradication of a species´ self-destructive tendencies, which might mean wiping out the civilisation. Even the most dense person will be accelerated into a higher state of consciousness, causing possible havoc in their mind and body if they are not prepared. Channeled material from the Shining the Light books tells of a civilisation which was utilising the planet´s resources to make it into a dynamo. This was killing the planet and it called on the photon belt which eradicated the race, everyone, in three days, by putting them to ´sleep´. Nothing as drastic as this will be necessary for Earth; the energy will encourage people to come into balance but where resisted will cause further imbalances.<br />
<br />
Other information from this source has been given about the effect on animals. They will forage more widely and attempt to give birth more often to maximize their species. They will also be drawn to built-up areas; in some cases this will be old territory for them but in general they will feel the need to be closer to humans. This would only apply to wild animals.<br />
<br />
The effects on the Earth´s body are expected to be quite dramatic. The photon belt enables the planet to repair herself. She will, for example, protect her oil. Too much is being drawn off by man and cannot all be replaced--not dissimilar to drawing off man´s cerebral spinal fluid. Mother Earth will harden the crust under the surface and pull in the oil, also gases, coal and ores, deeper into the centre, shifting harmlessly also benevolent races into protected regions. The photon belt will not apparently leave until humans utilise surface resources only, including water.<br />
<br />
Scientists will find that sub-atomic particles will become more evident and easier to detect. Electricity will be reduced and become less available in the next 50 years--this represents an energy depletion of the planet. Earth is taking on a new energy and scientists must find new ways of working with it. They will even give more attention to how love affects life and its chemistry. New diseases will arise and abnormal heart rhythms for the descending group but expansion of the heart for the ascending group.<br />
<br />
Other spectacular effects, some of a temporary nature, were expected prior to the recognition that Earth intended to receive the photon belt as gently as possible as our Sun system moves into it. Earth is circling the Sun, thus it is alternatively ahead of the Sun and behind in its linear translation towards the belt. Consequently, either the Sun or our planet would enter first. Scientifically it would have been impossible to predict which, since, as stated, the photon belt is expanding and contracting randomly. If the Sun reached the photon cloud before Earth it had been channeled that darkness would ensue for about three to five days. It would have been expected to be pitch dark with probable cancellation of electrical power sources. If, however, Earth went in first then the darkness would have been avoided. This was all earlier speculation.<br />
<br />
We were told by one source of ETs that as our planet enters the bands, which would be at a relatively high velocity, we would experience an immediate electric shock, lasting about one tenth of a second, but not dangerous. This appears unlikely now as we are moving in very gradually. Apparently it could have been sufficiently sudden to destroy the civilisation and to heal the planet quickly, but Earth requested a very gradual repair.<br />
<br />
Of greater concern were said to be the effects of the intense photon activity on the radiation belt around Earth and the sudden compression of the atmosphere and expansion, which was expected to be such that the radiation belt could ignite. If it did, within minutes the sky would be lit up with intense light, more powerful than from a welder´s torch. If eyes were not protected it would cause blindness. This intense light was expected to last three days. These dangers appear to have been by-passed. The photon belt encounter, thanks to Mother Earth, has been adjusted to give minimum suffering to mankind and maximum benefit.<br />
<br />
Another spectacular feature given in earlier reports but not high-lighted so much in the present ones, will be the effect of the intense photon activity on matter. High excitation of atoms will occur, causing fluorescence of all objects, and as a result there will be no normal night time during the period of interaction.<br />
<br />
The stellar alignments and accompanying photon-belt encounter will play a significant role in the (biblical) transformation of man. Our interaction with it has been referred to in channeling as the Christus. Moreover, the event is supposed to be the true nature of the ascension or rapture, well known in the prophecies of Christianity. The term ´Christus´ apparently expresses the Second Coming of Christ. (Christ is a state of being/consciousness --some ETs refer to it as the ´Christ office´. Jesus was not Christ but he could attune to this state--which in turn then paradoxically means he was (being) Christ.)<br />
<br />
There will be a rebirthing of planet Earth. We are told it will divide; each part retaining wholeness though, producing a 3rd density (frequency density) Earth and a 4th density Earth. This will not be perceived physically; the planets will be in different dimensions. One will be in a parallel universe relative to the other. Earth has many parallel bodies: one around 3.0; we are about 3.5, then 4.0 and 5.0, etc. (the 4th is apparently relatively unoccupied except for some animals having left us and are waiting). The Voyagers books of Anna Hayes describes the division into three time tracks and is highly recommended reading.<br />
<br />
(Note that serious books on physics cover parallel-universe theories--there is nothing particular weird or new about this. It has been channeled that we sometimes move into parallel-universe planes and back, which are sometimes virtually identical. A further example is that an advanced civilisation exists in the centre of the Earth but this particular civilisation is in a parallel plane which is reached by entering ´electromagnetic´ corridors near the openings at the poles and certain other regions.)<br />
<br />
Possibly the only sad event will be that some families will be split up by the natural spiritual selection of the photon-belt encounter. Some individuals will go with the more evolved Earth, referred to as 4th density, and others with the 3rd density Earth, which could permanently separate their evolution by several thousands of years (in rare instances one person taking the more evolved path may suspend progress to wait for the other).<br />
<br />
There are a number of greater cycles involved at this time, for example, 225 million years (the Reptilian cycle), 26,556 years (as mentioned), and 104,000 years (a prominent evolutionary peak after four cycles of 26,556 years), culminating in a powerful convergence at this time. It has also been stated that this point in time coincides with the universe reaching its maximum point of expansion. Synchronisation of all such nodes would be expected to open up the dimensional strata for the influx of new energy and the subsequent changes--in other words, a major alignment.<br />
<br />
The photon cloud has a high density of electrons and positrons (positive, anti-electrons). When an electron and a positron collide they are annihilated and the mass is converted into radiation--photons. The presence of these positrons, however, has been predicted to interfere with electricity, of which the latter is due to the flow of electrons. It has been indicated that before this event occurs it would be possible to redesign the present polarity system, giving a reversal of our polarity to compensate for this problem (we haven´t noticed any effect yet). The photon energy as a result of the collision of electrons and positrons will become a major source of free energy (and at this time the NWO will be unable to suppress its use).<br />
<br />
According to channeled information, extraterrestrials will be aiding our transition during this photon-belt event. It is stated that they altered (years ago) the basic polarity of the Sun to allow it to maintain the integrity of the Sun´s planetary system. At a later time, however, NASA´s space probe Ulysses detected that the magnetic field of the Sun no longer has a north and south pole! The Sun´s magnetic field was found to have changed dramatically into a homogeneous field. No scientific explanation was given, and of course it has been withheld from the public. Furthermore, the SOHO satellite more recently revealed that the Sun responded abnormally to the impact of cosmic bodies causing an eruption of some 30 to 35 solar flares, which is unprecedented. (Note that unknown to present physics the Sun and planetary bodies, etc. have powerful high-frequency electromagnetic fields which would be expected to form the basis for the solar system integrity, despite interference and jeopardy from magnetic pole variations.)<br />
<br />
The photon-belt encounter and its origin, the alignments, are intended to be a positive experience but only man with sufficient discipline to improve and elevate his consciousness can ensure that the anticipated Golden Age will manifest.</div>

			"articleBody": "The Photon Belt Encounter\n\nglobalnet.co.uk\nNovember 23, 2005\n\nBy means of satellite instrumentation, astronomers in 1961 discovered what appeared to be an unusual nebula. We normally understand the nebula phenomenon as a vast cloud-like mass of gas or dust. This one, however, appeared to have anomalous properties and was named the Golden Nebula. The public´s attention was not drawn to this unusual revelation until much later, presumably when it was realised that this nebula´s location was coincident with the projected orbit of our solar system. Around the early 1980s a radio announcement in the U.S. was made (heard by the author) that our solar system was, in fact, going to collide with an ´electromagnetic cloud´ in the not too distant future. This incredibly important statement of astronomical and historical significance was expressed in the usual casual and indifferent manner as though of little consequence--just as was, about that time, the announcement that the FDIC (bank-depositor´s insurance) was penniless! Follow-up data was then suppressed and another government cover-up was contrived for the typical purpose of exploiting where possible natural events to camouflage contrived chaos.\n\nWhat is this electromagnetic cloud, this golden nebula, sometimes referred to as the radiant nebula by ETs? Its more universal designation is ´photon belt´ or ´photon band´, consisting of many bands, and any encounter with this belt is recognised by extraterrestrials as of great import. It is in fact referred to by more enlightened ETs as a ´planetary trouble shooter´.\n\nLet us outline the mechanics of this anticipated encounter of our solar system with the photon belt. The whole universe is held together by means of vortices within vortices of centripetal energy--with their associated electromagnetic fields--like whirlpools on water, within larger whirlpools (this is the machinery behind Einstein´s spacetime topology of general relativity). These spiralling energies give rise to natural spacetime orbits: satellites around planets, planets around stars, solar systems around other more major vortex centres, and so on. Our planet Earth orbits the Sun once a year but our solar system as a whole also traverses an orbit in this section of the galaxy with a period of about 24,000 years. There are many other solar (star) systems in this cyclic motion (just as there are numerous planets orbiting the Sun). The Pleiades, which is encircled by the photon belt, is about 400 light years from us, and is part of this system and in fact our solar system orbits the central sun of the Pleiades, Alcyone. The belt consists of many photon bands emanating from the centre of the galaxy, and associated with the spiral arms of the galaxy.\n\nThus our solar system, and therefore planet Earth, takes some 24,000 years to come back to its same point in this particular orbit. Picture several star systems in a massive orbit, but now envisage overall a toroid or doughnut-shaped cloud cutting across these orbiting star systems. It is also described as an amoeba-like cloud of particles but most of its frequencies are invisible. This is the photon belt, or photon band. This means our solar system goes through the belt twice each cycle of 24,000 years (that is, every half cycle). The thickness of the photon cloud is such that technically it takes about 2000 years for our solar system to pass through, and therefore about 10,000 years between each encounter with this belt (2 x 10,000 plus 2 x 2000 = 24,000 years). Nevertheless, some sources state that the period in the band could be much less: 30 to 40 years, depending on man´s resistance to change. This is difficult to relate to our fixed cyclic picture but, in addition, this same source points out that Earth was in trouble from the damage incurred by our civilisation and called for the photon belt--a typical emergency call procedure for planets. The fact that the ´call´ was synchronous with the orbital position merely indicates the higher plans--that the big picture would already have matters organised to happen in that way. This ´call´ occurred in 1947 and manifested as a signal which could have been monitored on the AM band, producing a clicking sound--see Robert Shapiro´s Explorer Race and Shining The Light series of books.\n\nWhen will this interaction occur? Scientists around the globe in 1992 predicted that the encounter would occur within months to a year; with significant disagreements. A particular source of Pleiadian extraterrestrials indicated that it would not occur until just after 2010 and that it was difficult to predict since the belt was oscillating randomly. There have been in fact huge discrepancies in channeled material regarding the date of this revelatory occurrence, ranging from 1987 to ´definitely before the end of this century´ to 2003 and finally about 2011-2012. Other Pleiadians tell us that our solar system skimmed the belt for a few days in 1987, then contacted it for over a week in the following year, increasing the degree of entry each year, and then the Sun went in fully in 1998. The information indicates that Earth does not enter fully until 2012. At the present time we are being informed that the Earth is in the belt (for the period December, 1998 and June, 1999). The belt does, however, have an outer aura which we enter first, and we are not expected to experience the full-blown effects until 2012.\n\nWhat does the photon belt consist of? What will be its effects on the life on our planet, positive or negative? Also what is its purpose, if any? The radio announcement used the term ´electromagnetic´ to describe the phenomenon--this is the same as photon, which is a particle of light or electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe photon belt is an immense region of space which is radiating intense electromagnetic radiation throughout the visible spectrum and beyond, into high-frequency invisible light; even including some x-ray spectra. It is part of a magnetic flow of light throughout the galaxy. Reference has already been made through the media to huge increases in intensity of ´dangerous´ radiation entering through the holes in the ozone layer in certain regions of our planet.\n\nIt appears that for mankind on this planet the photon belt encounter will be essentially a spiritual experience--but this really depends on man. Nevertheless, the real benefits of this phenomenon is from what is actually causing the photons. It is linked with the so-called convergences. If we are sufficiently evolved at the time, great advancements will occur in our consciousness as we attune to the higher-frequencies. If we are negative, that is, possess too many lower vibrations, the result of selfish actions, we are not expected to survive the frequency incompatibility.\n\nThe convergence is the end of a stellar activation cycle--this is explained in detail in Anna Hayes´ material. Thus, what causes the photon belt? The stellar activations have already begun and will continue through 2012 to 2017. The principle time cycle is 26,556 years, which is the precession of the equinoxes and is caused by a slow wobble of the Earth as it spins and orbits around the Sun. This is known by astronomers. Note that this period is not to be confused with the 24,000 (or so) year cycle in which our solar system orbits Alcyone.\n\nStellar activation occurs when our solar system lines up with the higher frequency bands of Pleiades (star Alcyone), Sirius, Arcturus, Orion, and Andromeda. The frequency bands then merge and pass through Earth. If Earth is out of balance within itself due to abuse from invader ETs, the illuminati, and Earthman´s behaviour, the higher frequencies will cause an ´Armageddon´.\n\nTo understand the alignment, one could think of circles within circles (cycles within cycles) turning at different rates to which are attached magnets. Clearly, periodically they could line up, forming one long and powerful magnet. This would act like a powerful current. It is called a holographic beam since it contains the fundamental energy of these systems.\n\nAfter the convergence, this holographic beam carries the remains of photon activity. When Earth is in alignment, it merges with higher-dimensional parallel Earth, Tara. During this process the particles and antiparticles of these planets and their antiparallel planets are unified in certain specific ways. When these particles and antiparticles come together they create intense photonic activity which we know as the photon belt. It is continually renewed each cycle as the holographic beam passes out through Alcyone, leaving the band around this star.\n\nAs implied, there will be a natural spiritual selection. In the initial stages of the photon-belt encounter only sensitives will detect anything strange but when we enter fully, even the most hardened individuals will receive the full effects. Both great illumination of consciousness will occur and great resistance to new ideas. This is a period of awakening essentially due to the ascension cycle and planetary alignment. What proportion of effects are directly due to the belt is difficult to say. Nevertheless this phenomenon of both the photon belt plus stellar activity will reduce the veil stopping us from seeing who we are. It will remove some of the barriers around cells and DNA making them more reactive or responsive to new energies, and in fact the DNA will attempt to respond to the changing frequencies, increasing its capacity.\n\nPsychological characteristics of entering the belt are the effect of uprooting hidden, secret, or withheld material, bringing it to the surface for transmutation. This means psychological and physical disease patterns will be forced to the surface, that is, the conscious mind. This will give tremendous opportunity to make advancements but also where there is too much to handle will cause illness, depressions, disease and death.\n\nMore advanced viewpoints see the photon band as a being, a consciousness, which essentially has a ´personality´ for change and action. It presents opportunities for change on a planet by adding new energies. It increases the flow of energy in the magnetic grids of Earth, attracting new ideas and energies. People will feel the need to transform but those who consider this physical reality their only expression will dwindle into greater fixations, blocks and negativity. Nevertheless it aids eradication of a species´ self-destructive tendencies, which might mean wiping out the civilisation. Even the most dense person will be accelerated into a higher state of consciousness, causing possible havoc in their mind and body if they are not prepared. Channeled material from the Shining the Light books tells of a civilisation which was utilising the planet´s resources to make it into a dynamo. This was killing the planet and it called on the photon belt which eradicated the race, everyone, in three days, by putting them to ´sleep´. Nothing as drastic as this will be necessary for Earth; the energy will encourage people to come into balance but where resisted will cause further imbalances.\n\nOther information from this source has been given about the effect on animals. They will forage more widely and attempt to give birth more often to maximize their species. They will also be drawn to built-up areas; in some cases this will be old territory for them but in general they will feel the need to be closer to humans. This would only apply to wild animals.\n\nThe effects on the Earth´s body are expected to be quite dramatic. The photon belt enables the planet to repair herself. She will, for example, protect her oil. Too much is being drawn off by man and cannot all be replaced--not dissimilar to drawing off man´s cerebral spinal fluid. Mother Earth will harden the crust under the surface and pull in the oil, also gases, coal and ores, deeper into the centre, shifting harmlessly also benevolent races into protected regions. The photon belt will not apparently leave until humans utilise surface resources only, including water.\n\nScientists will find that sub-atomic particles will become more evident and easier to detect. Electricity will be reduced and become less available in the next 50 years--this represents an energy depletion of the planet. Earth is taking on a new energy and scientists must find new ways of working with it. They will even give more attention to how love affects life and its chemistry. New diseases will arise and abnormal heart rhythms for the descending group but expansion of the heart for the ascending group.\n\nOther spectacular effects, some of a temporary nature, were expected prior to the recognition that Earth intended to receive the photon belt as gently as possible as our Sun system moves into it. Earth is circling the Sun, thus it is alternatively ahead of the Sun and behind in its linear translation towards the belt. Consequently, either the Sun or our planet would enter first. Scientifically it would have been impossible to predict which, since, as stated, the photon belt is expanding and contracting randomly. If the Sun reached the photon cloud before Earth it had been channeled that darkness would ensue for about three to five days. It would have been expected to be pitch dark with probable cancellation of electrical power sources. If, however, Earth went in first then the darkness would have been avoided. This was all earlier speculation.\n\nWe were told by one source of ETs that as our planet enters the bands, which would be at a relatively high velocity, we would experience an immediate electric shock, lasting about one tenth of a second, but not dangerous. This appears unlikely now as we are moving in very gradually. Apparently it could have been sufficiently sudden to destroy the civilisation and to heal the planet quickly, but Earth requested a very gradual repair.\n\nOf greater concern were said to be the effects of the intense photon activity on the radiation belt around Earth and the sudden compression of the atmosphere and expansion, which was expected to be such that the radiation belt could ignite. If it did, within minutes the sky would be lit up with intense light, more powerful than from a welder´s torch. If eyes were not protected it would cause blindness. This intense light was expected to last three days. These dangers appear to have been by-passed. The photon belt encounter, thanks to Mother Earth, has been adjusted to give minimum suffering to mankind and maximum benefit.\n\nAnother spectacular feature given in earlier reports but not high-lighted so much in the present ones, will be the effect of the intense photon activity on matter. High excitation of atoms will occur, causing fluorescence of all objects, and as a result there will be no normal night time during the period of interaction.\n\nThe stellar alignments and accompanying photon-belt encounter will play a significant role in the (biblical) transformation of man. Our interaction with it has been referred to in channeling as the Christus. Moreover, the event is supposed to be the true nature of the ascension or rapture, well known in the prophecies of Christianity. The term ´Christus´ apparently expresses the Second Coming of Christ. (Christ is a state of being\/consciousness --some ETs refer to it as the ´Christ office´. Jesus was not Christ but he could attune to this state--which in turn then paradoxically means he was (being) Christ.)\n\nThere will be a rebirthing of planet Earth. We are told it will divide; each part retaining wholeness though, producing a 3rd density (frequency density) Earth and a 4th density Earth. This will not be perceived physically; the planets will be in different dimensions. One will be in a parallel universe relative to the other. Earth has many parallel bodies: one around 3.0; we are about 3.5, then 4.0 and 5.0, etc. (the 4th is apparently relatively unoccupied except for some animals having left us and are waiting). The Voyagers books of Anna Hayes describes the division into three time tracks and is highly recommended reading.\n\n(Note that serious books on physics cover parallel-universe theories--there is nothing particular weird or new about this. It has been channeled that we sometimes move into parallel-universe planes and back, which are sometimes virtually identical. A further example is that an advanced civilisation exists in the centre of the Earth but this particular civilisation is in a parallel plane which is reached by entering ´electromagnetic´ corridors near the openings at the poles and certain other regions.)\n\nPossibly the only sad event will be that some families will be split up by the natural spiritual selection of the photon-belt encounter. Some individuals will go with the more evolved Earth, referred to as 4th density, and others with the 3rd density Earth, which could permanently separate their evolution by several thousands of years (in rare instances one person taking the more evolved path may suspend progress to wait for the other).\n\nThere are a number of greater cycles involved at this time, for example, 225 million years (the Reptilian cycle), 26,556 years (as mentioned), and 104,000 years (a prominent evolutionary peak after four cycles of 26,556 years), culminating in a powerful convergence at this time. It has also been stated that this point in time coincides with the universe reaching its maximum point of expansion. Synchronisation of all such nodes would be expected to open up the dimensional strata for the influx of new energy and the subsequent changes--in other words, a major alignment.\n\nThe photon cloud has a high density of electrons and positrons (positive, anti-electrons). When an electron and a positron collide they are annihilated and the mass is converted into radiation--photons. The presence of these positrons, however, has been predicted to interfere with electricity, of which the latter is due to the flow of electrons. It has been indicated that before this event occurs it would be possible to redesign the present polarity system, giving a reversal of our polarity to compensate for this problem (we haven´t noticed any effect yet). The photon energy as a result of the collision of electrons and positrons will become a major source of free energy (and at this time the NWO will be unable to suppress its use).\n\nAccording to channeled information, extraterrestrials will be aiding our transition during this photon-belt event. It is stated that they altered (years ago) the basic polarity of the Sun to allow it to maintain the integrity of the Sun´s planetary system. At a later time, however, NASA´s space probe Ulysses detected that the magnetic field of the Sun no longer has a north and south pole! The Sun´s magnetic field was found to have changed dramatically into a homogeneous field. No scientific explanation was given, and of course it has been withheld from the public. Furthermore, the SOHO satellite more recently revealed that the Sun responded abnormally to the impact of cosmic bodies causing an eruption of some 30 to 35 solar flares, which is unprecedented. (Note that unknown to present physics the Sun and planetary bodies, etc. have powerful high-frequency electromagnetic fields which would be expected to form the basis for the solar system integrity, despite interference and jeopardy from magnetic pole variations.)\n\nThe photon-belt encounter and its origin, the alignments, are intended to be a positive experience but only man with sufficient discipline to improve and elevate his consciousness can ensure that the anticipated Golden Age will manifest.",
