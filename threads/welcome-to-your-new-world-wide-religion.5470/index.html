								<div class="bbWrapper">I constantly wonder when people will push for evidence that:<br />
<br />
a) Global Warming is REAL (remember the 70s when the same group of social elites were warning of the coming ice age?)<br />
b) That any sort of &quot;climate change&quot; is primarily due to mankind (Anthropic Global Warming) instead of the sun.<br />
<br />
This article is well done.  And it should work to put the spotlight on &quot;climate change&quot; freaks as the priests of a new religion...<br />

 <span style="color: #ff0000"> <b><i>Global Warming as Religion and not Science</i></b> </span> <br />
<br />
<i>Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.<br />
Blaise Pascal</i><br />
<br />
It was Michael Crichton who first prominently identified environmentalism as a religion. That was in a speech in 2003, but the world has moved on apace since then and adherents of the creed now have a firm grip on the world at large.<br />
<br />
Global Warming has become the core belief in a new eco-theology. The term is used as shorthand for anthropogenic (or man made) global warming. It is closely related to other modern belief systems, such as political correctness, chemophobia and various other forms of scaremongering, but it represents the vanguard in the assault on scientific man.<br />
The activists now prefer to call it &quot;climate change&quot;. This gives them two advantages:<br />
1.	It allows them to seize as &quot;evidence&quot; the inevitable occurrences of unusually cold weather as well as warm ones.<br />
2.	The climate is always changing, so they must be right.<br />
Only the relatively elderly can remember the cynical haste with which the scaremongers dropped the &quot;coming ice age&quot; and embraced exactly the opposite prediction, but aimed at the same culprit â€“ industry. This was in Britain, which was the cradle of the new belief and was a response to the derision resulting from the searing summer of 1976. The father of the new religion was Sir Crispin Tickell, and because he had the ear of Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who was engaged in a battle with the coal miners and the oil sheiks, it was introduced into international politics with the authority of the only major political leader holding a qualification in science. The introduction was timely yet ironic since, in the wake of the world's political upheavals, a powerful new grouping of left-wing interests was coalescing around environmental issues. The result was a new form of godless religion. The global warming cult has the characteristics of religion and not science for the following reasons.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Faith and scepticism</i></b><br />
<br />
Faith is a belief held without evidence. The scientific method, a loose collection of procedures of great variety, is based on precisely the opposite concept, as famously declared by Thomas Henry Huxley:<br />
The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority, as such. For him, scepticism is the highest of duties; blind faith the one unpardonable sin. <br />
Huxley was one of a long tradition of British sceptical philosophers.  From the Bacons, through the likes of Locke, Hume and Russell, to the magnificent climax of Popper's statement of the principle of falsifiability, the scientific method was painfully established, only to be abandoned in a few short decades. It is one of the great ironies of modern history that the nation that was the cradle of the scientific method came to lead the process of its abandonment. The great difference, then, is that religion demands belief, while science requires disbelief. There is a great variety of faiths. Atheism is just as much a faith as theism. There is no evidence either way. There is no fundamental clash between faith and science â€“ they do not intersect. The difficulties arise, however, when one pretends to be the other.<br />
The Royal Society, as a major part of the flowering of the tradition, was founded on the basis of scepticism. Its motto &quot;On the word of no one&quot; was a stout affirmation. Now suddenly, following their successful coup, the Greens have changed this motto of centuries to one that manages to be both banal and sinister â€“ &quot;Respect the facts.&quot; When people start talking about &quot;the facts&quot; it is time to start looking for the fictions. Real science does not talk about facts; it talks about observations, which might turn out to be inaccurate or even irrelevant.<br />
The global warmers like to use the name of science, but they do not like its methods. They promote slogans such a &quot;The science is settled&quot; when real scientists know that science is never settled. They were not, however, always so wise. In 1900, for example, the great Lord Kelvin famously stated, &quot;There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.&quot; Within a few years classical physics was shattered by Einstein and his contemporaries. Since then, in science, the debate is never closed.<br />
The world might (or might not) have warmed by a fraction of a degree. This might (or might not) be all (or in part) due to the activities of mankind. It all depends on the quality of observations and the validity of various hypotheses. Science is at ease with this situation. It accepts various theories, such as gravitation or evolution, as the least bad available and of the most practical use, but it does not believe. Religion is different.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Sin and absolution</i></b><br />
<br />
It is in the nature of religion to be authoritarian and proscriptive. Essential to this is the concept of sin â€“ a transgression in thought or deed of theological principles.<br />
Original sin in the older religions derived from one of the founts of life on earth â€“ sex. The new religion goes even further back to the very basis of all life â€“ carbon. Perhaps the fundamental human fear is fear of life itself. The amazing propensity of carbon to form compounds of unlimited complexity made the existence of life possible, while its dioxide is the primary foodstuff, the very start of the food chain. Every item of nutriment you consume started out as atmospheric carbon dioxide. It is therefore the ideal candidate for original sin, since no one can escape dependence on it. This manna that gave us life is now regularly branded in media headlines as &quot;pollution&quot; and &quot;toxic&quot;: surely one of the most perverse dysphemisms in the history of language.<br />
The corrective to sin in religion is absolution, and the power of most religions comes from their claim to have the monopoly on absolution. So it is with the new godless religion. Furthermore, it is in the nature of religion to create false markets. In the time of Chaucer the Pardoner sold papal indulgences, which freed the prosperous from the consequences of sin. Likewise, the new pardoners sell carbon offsets. As in so much of both ancient and modern society these activities divert effort from wealth creation and so act as a drag on the economy. They also grant to the rich a comfort that is not available to the poor â€“ a sure road to success.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Proselytes and evangelists</i></b><br />
<br />
Most religions seek to grow by means of proselytism. Science does not seek or need converts. It teaches those that are willing to learn, but it does not impose itself on those who are indifferent. Religions (at least those that are successful) have a different imperative. A growing cohort of believers reinforces the beliefs of existing adherents and participating in the quest for converts helps assuage the inevitable doubts they might harbour. Successful religions are structured to encompass this expansionary mechanism. Those who can recruit others to the cause are therefore held in high regard.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Demagogues and hypocrites</i></b><br />
<br />
Demagoguery is also, therefore, a feature of religion. Some people have the capacity to hold the masses in their thrall. It is a mysterious art, as their skills of oratory do not often stand up to any sort of critical examination. They are idols of the moment, who often turn out to have feet of clay, as so frequently seems to happen with charismatic TV preachers.<br />
One of the most notorious demagogues of the godless religion is Al Gore. He is certainly no great orator, but he makes up for it with chutzpah. His disregard for truth is exemplified by his characteristic and ubiquitous pose in front of a satellite photograph of hurricane Katrina. Even some of the most vehement climate &quot;scientists&quot; refrain from connecting that particular isolated and monstrously tragic event with global warming. Likewise his Old Testament style prophecies of further disasters, such as floods due to a rise in sea level, greatly exceed the more modest claims of the &quot;professionals&quot;. As in the overthrow of the cities of the plain and other biblical prophecies, Gore promises a rain of fire and brimstone on us, unless we change our ways.<br />
Gore also displays all the characteristics of the classical religious hypocrite. He disregards his own proscriptions with abandonment and ostentation. By his own measure (carbon footprint) his sins are great; at least twenty times those of the average American. It is all right though, because he purchases absolution (carbon offsets) through his own company. As he is a private individual it is not known whether he profits directly, but at a minimum he does not pay out of his taxable income and, worst of all, he demonstrates that the rich are immune from any of the actual privations that attachment to the new religion visits upon its poorer adherents. This is also not unknown in traditional religions and has been a source of material for satirists throughout the centuries.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Infidels and apostates</i></b><br />
<br />
Religions vary in their treatment of unbelievers, which ranges from disregard to slaughter. The new religion relies at present on verbal assault and character assassination, though there are those who would go further. They call the infidels &quot;deniers&quot; â€“ a cheap and quite despicable verbal reference to the Holocaust. There is a sustained campaign to deny the deniers any sort of public platform for their views.<br />
Apostates are universally even more reviled than infidels. They have turned their backs on the true faith, whichever that might happen to be. Partial apostates, or heretics, are even more loathed and through the ages have been subjected to the most appalling punishments and deaths.  In the case of the &quot;sceptical environmentalist&quot;, Bjorn Lomborg, he is of the faith. In fact he is a serial believer; accepting, for example, that eating celery causes two percent of all cancers and, of course, that global warming is man made, but he rejects the sacrificing of humanity to the belief. This is unacceptable! What are a few million deaths from dirty water, mosquito bites and other hazards so long as people can be made to conform? So far he has only been assaulted with insults and custard pies. Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace, broke with the movement over its growing anti-human, anti-scientific tendencies and drift into extremism. The last straw for him was the campaign against chlorine, not only an essential component of human life but also the basis of one of the most dramatically life-saving hygienic interventions. He has, consequently, been subjected to a prolonged campaign of vilification, described as an eco-Judas, turncoat and traitor. Every minor commentator or blogger who manifests disbelief can expect to be the target of abuse from self-appointed protectors of the creed.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Sacrifice and ritual</i></b><br />
<br />
It is part of human nature that we do not like to admit making a mistake, even to ourselves. So if, for example, we buy a magic device that by some mysterious means improves the fuel efficiency of our car, we drive a little more conservatively in order to prove that we have not been had. Religions exploit this weakness as a means creating and reinforcing commitment. If someone can be induced or coerced into making a sacrifice they then have a stake in the cause.<br />
Windmills, for example, are the symbols of power, not physical power (of which they are derisorily short) but political and religious power. They are like the great domes of temples, the statues of Saddam or the big &quot;M&quot; arch of MacDonald's. Windmills are ugly: they destroy the visual (and aural) landscape, but that is their purpose. They are part of the sacrifice. It would not be so bad if they were simply useless, but it is worse than that. Conventional generating systems of equivalent power have to operate for 80% of the time, while the wind is blowing too soft or too hard, and then be switched to warm standby when it is just right, an expensive and wasteful process. Windmills are there to remind us of our commitment, willing or not, to the cause, both in excessive taxation and loss of visual and aural amenity.<br />
As in other forms of mental conditioning, continued reinforcement is a necessary part of the process and that is where ritual comes in. Ritual comprises tiny sacrifices infinitely repeated. Going round the house switching off standby lights performs the same function as the repetitive chanting of mantras. The fact that it is pointless is the whole point.<br />
One of the most valuable ideas of modern engineering, lost in the noise, has been lost in the noise. In most applications a change of, say, one part in ten thousand is too small to be measured and therefore not worthy of concern. If standby in domestic devices ever were a problem, it is now a rapidly diminishing one. In the old days of thermionic devices (valves or tubes) it was necessary to keep cathodes heated to avoid a prolonged warming up period, but transistors and LCDs do not have cathodes and are therefore instantly available. Present standby powers are about five watts. In the temperate zone that is transferred from your central heating bill for half the year, though it is barely enough to keep your big toe warm. In fact, it would be relatively easy to make the standby power microwatts, just enough to power an optical sensor and decoder, though until now nobody thought such a pointless exercise necessary.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Prophecy and divination</i></b><br />
<br />
In the real world attempts at prophecy always come to a bad end. Only in religious texts and the currently popular fantasy fiction do prophecies come true. H G Wells, in The shape of things to come, successfully predicted the mechanised War, as did Winston Churchill, but little else, and the film that Wells closely supervised now provides rather comic entertainment (but wonderful music). Even those of us closely involved in electronics did not foresee that a development of the ancient art of writing on stone, lithography, would result in millions of transistors being available on one chip, changing the world forever, including granting new and sinister means of control to those in authority.<br />
Likewise, divination was greatly regarded in all cultures, ancient and modern. Stars were observed, chickens and other animals slaughtered, so that their steaming entrails could be examined to predict the future, cards were shuffled and crystal balls peered into. Comparatively recently the leader of the most powerful nation on earth relied on the advice of astrologers.<br />
Now divination has returned with, for example, the examination of the entrails of ancient trees. Though the methods used are invalid (they wrongly assume linearity) and have been comprehensively shown to be irreproducible and misleading, the results have been paraded before the world in defence of draconian sacrificial policies.<br />
The main form of modern divination, however, is computer models. Forty odd years ago an instruction passed round the Faculty of Engineering of the University of London that no PhDs were to be awarded on the basis of computer models unsupported by measurement. As T S Eliot asked in Choruses from The Rock<br />
Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?<br />
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?<br />
Now, huge and generously funded university and government departments do nothing but develop computer models, involving assumptions about physical interactions that are still not understood by science. Their dubious (to say the least) results are used by the new international priesthood to frighten the people into conformity.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Puritans and killjoys</i></b><br />
<br />
No one has bettered Mencken's definition of Puritanism â€“ the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy. It is an unfortunate characteristic of many varieties of religion that this characteristic is to the fore and Global Warming is far from being an exception. Nothing the proponents offer involves an improvement or even maintenance of human contentment, quite the opposite in fact. You might think that any philosophy of life would involve swings and roundabouts, good and bad, but think again. Virtually everything you enjoy is now sinful â€“ holidays, driving your car, having a comfortable temperature in your home, being free from the stink of rotting garbage, and on and on.<br />
As with the flagellants of old, for some people a feeling of self-righteousness not only transcends all discomforts, but derives from them. The rest of us have to be coerced into conformity.<br />
It is an unfortunate fact of life that there are people who get their kicks out of pushing other people around. The existence of little pleasures of life, such as savouring a fine wine or cigar (and even more so the proletarian equivalents) is intolerable to them. They will exploit any means â€“ the distortion of science, the suborning of weak politicians, the repetition of mendacious propaganda â€“ to achieve the elimination of the hated practices. The eleventh commandment for the killjoys is &quot;Thou shalt not have fun&quot;, and global warming provides a delightful playground for them.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Censorship and angles</i></b><br />
<br />
Freedom of speech and publication is at the very heart of science. Even the most foolish of hypotheses is allowed to be offered for examination. In much of religion the opposite is true; challenging the established dogma is heresy, for which the punishment has ranged from ostracism to horrific torture and death. One of the greatest ironies produced by the successful policy of entryism by the eco-theologians is that it is none other than the Royal Society that has been orchestrating the attempt to censor any deviation from establishment beliefs. Authoritarian politicians, such as Congressman Brad Miller, would give such suppression the force of law.<br />
It is a curious repetition of history that those who advance the hypothesis that the sun is the controlling element in changes of climate are vilified, just as Galileo was, for supporting the Copernican heliocentric description of the solar system. Yet the sun is clearly the driver for climate â€“ if it stopped shining, the earth's temperature would drop to near absolute zero. In the establishment dogma the sun is barely mentioned, while the puny efforts of mankind are gratuitously magnified out of proportion. In a scientific approach to climate, a full understanding of the behaviour of that solitary driver would be the first prerequisite, but this is waived in the interests of piety; so leading solar researchers have been deprived of funding.<br />
One of the most exploited ways of angling the news is by &quot;ratchet reporting&quot;. News of unusual warm weather, for example,  is given copious coverage, while cold weather is studiously ignored. Thus the spring of  2007 was disastrously cold in parts of North America, with ice-bound ships and snowed-off baseball, but this was kept secret from the British, whose wonderful summery April was presented as though it were bad news (and that in the land of rheumatism and bronchitis!). The fact that Britain had no spring at all in 2006 was conveniently forgotten, except as a basis of comparison to establish that 2007 was substantially warmer.<br />
That the media know that they are peddling untruths is demonstrated by these tricks they get up to. If they were confident of the truth of their case there would be no need to fake the coverage. They have been frequently caught out faking their numbers and graphs, but only a few internet surfers know about it. If you think you have a good case, you can afford to present both sides, but they don't. The great majority of the population have no idea that there is an alternative view. That is not science, it is religion.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Control and taxation</i></b><br />
<br />
Religion has always played an important part in the imposition of authority. For many centuries it took the form of the &quot;Divine Right of Kings&quot; or the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;. Once you get the people to believe, you can get away with almost any imposition. The alliance between the shaman and the legislator has long been the very foundation of authoritarianism. Even when the dogma is a godless one, such as Marxism, it is imposed with religious fervour, for that is the way to induce conformity.<br />
People now accept laws that restrict their liberty and standard of living, which would once have provoked riots, because they are cloaked in a quasi-religious formula of environmentalism. So-called environmental burdens, for example, now greatly outweigh the incremental effect of the poll tax that met with such violent opposition in England, yet are now meekly accepted, as is the parasitic presence of various forms of snooper, who even invade people's dustbins.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Contradictions and irrationality</i></b><br />
<br />
Traditional religions not only tolerated contradiction and irrationality, they embrace them as part of the mystique. Words and phrases are repeated ad nauseam and in strange contexts, until they lose all meaning and become self-preserving mantras. <br />
Contradictions and irrationality also abound in the modern theocratic world. The EU, for example, gratuitously destroys a tiny industry making traditional barometers, on the grounds of an irrational fear of mercury, then imposes the use of fluorescent light bulbs that distribute that same dreaded substance in huge quantities across the continent, all on the basis of the threat of global warming.<br />
People who have never heard of Wien or Planck confidently assert that it is &quot;obvious&quot; that man-made CO2 will cause runaway warming of the planet, when it is not at all obvious to many who are familiar with the works of those gentlemen. It is obvious in the sense that it is obvious that believers will have everlasting life or that a senseless act of self-immolation will earn the eternal attentions of 72 virgins in Paradise. The capacity to believe six impossible things before breakfast has been restored from fantasy to accepted normality.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Wealth and power</i></b><br />
<br />
Some organisms develop the ingredients to survive and multiply, so it is with business and religions. It is characteristic of businesses that they dispose of the entrepreneurs who create them and are taken over by a different breed of corporate manager: so it is with religions. The brutally suppressed troglodytes who were the early Christians of Rome were a different breed from the cardinals, bishops and abbots who bestrode mediaeval Europe and lived the opulent life. There were also, of course, the humble and saintly mendicant friars. The equivalents of all these varieties exist within the new movement.<br />
Money is the basis of the new religion. It poured in from various foundations (the so-called ketchup money) and naÃ¯ve donors. The activists found that they had to maintain and innovate their product (anxiety) to keep the income rising, so they had to keep increasing the imaginary threats both in intensity and number. With money came power. In Britain, the political parties are all effectively bankrupt, so the temptation to hang onto the coattails of a movement with so much momentum was irresistible. Even the Conservative Party submitted to a coup that was totally alien to everything it had ever believed in.<br />
The other route to power was the Trotskyite method of entryism. Once one adherent to the cause obtained a position of authority he could recruit others of a like mind. One by one the bastions of the media, and even science itself, fell to the intruders. A new breed of environmental editors achieved a monopoly of reporting in those areas that coincided with their beliefs. With powerful media organisations behind them they then also had the protection of the law to intimidate their adversaries. Opposition to the movement was largely confined to the internet and a few determined individuals in remote institutions, such as the emasculated rump of the British House of Lords.<br />
With power comes patronage. At its best this has produced great architecture and art. At its worst it produces vast acres of ugly, worse than useless windmills and rigidly controlled research. What passed as scientific research a quarter of a century ago now barely exists. To get funding, your project has to conform to one of the mantra descriptions, such as &quot;sustainable development&quot;. Doubters are afraid to speak out. Their institutions are dependent on millions in grants at the disposal of green officials to obtain &quot;appropriate&quot; results relevant to global warming and related scares. When your institution is involved in a fight for survival, you do not rock the boat.<br />
The lavishness of the tax-funded, aviation-fuelled, international junkets enjoyed by the global warming priesthood, contrasted with the frugal gatherings of their relatively impotent scientific opponents, is the very stuff of mediaeval satire. Just as Rabelais had to go into hiding from the anger of the priesthood of his time, so critics of the new religion are largely confined to the interstices of the internet. As ever, wealth and power determine the ability to propagate one's views. It might be some small compensation for members of the resistance, cowering in the electronic maquis,  that history remembers the name of Rabelais, while his persecutors are forgotten.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Confession and salvation</i></b><br />
<br />
One of the last bastions of science to fall was the British Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Science and Manufacture. It has a Chief Executive who was formerly one of the most powerful green civil servants. It now offers its fellows the opportunity to make public confession of their sins in the form of their &quot;carbon footprint&quot;. They even have a programme of &quot;Carbon Control&quot; directed at seven to fourteen year olds, urging them to take control of their carbon emissions. Young children now have nightmares about the burning planet, just as some of us once had nightmares about burning in hell unless we believed, and then lay awake at night wondering whether we believed or not, or what &quot;believe&quot; actually means. The ruthless exploitation of the receptivity of the young, and their relentless indoctrination, is one of the less pleasant characteristics of much of religion. As the Jesuits say &quot;Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man.&quot;<br />
Hell-fire is the stick and salvation is the carrot. Perhaps the best you can say about the new religion is that the object of salvation is &quot;the planet&quot; and not just oneself.  It is also the worst you can say; for it is essentially inhuman; which is what inflames heretics like Lomborg. Science, of course is also inhuman. Science though, unlike religion, does not seek to dictate policy. It can provide information for policy-makers, such as &quot;If you do this, millions of Africans are likely to die&quot; but it does not say &quot;You must, or must not, do this.&quot; Religion, depending upon its particular variety, will say &quot;They must be saved&quot; or, while not so indelicate as to put it into words, &quot;Let them die.&quot; One of the most offensive manifestations of the new religion occurred when hundreds of the priesthood went on one of their lavish junkets in Africa, where all around them was suffering and death.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Envoi</i></b><br />
<br />
The human spirit is sick. It soared during the enlightenment of the eighteenth century. It flowered during the nineteenth. It beat off the tyrants of the twentieth century.  Now, at an alarming rate, it is surrendering its freedoms to a concocted religion based on fraudulent science. Of course, it is not only science that has suffered in the overwhelming cultural downturn. The great artistic tradition has given way to displays of dead animals and soiled beds. In much of what passes for literature and drama, the expletives remain while the loftier aspirations of humanity are deleted. Entertainment is debased by displays of banality, cruelty and vacuous, groundless celebrity. It was science, however, that gave us lives of a length, comfort and healthiness that were unthought-of, even within human memory; a gift that is cold-bloodedly, but covertly, being denied to millions in poorer parts of the world. Extremists of the new religion regard humanity as an inconvenience or a pestilence that can be disposed of (not including themselves, of course).<br />
Above all, science represented the triumph of humanity over the primitive superstitions that haunted our ancestors, a creation of pure reason, a monument to that evolutionary (or, if you prefer, God-given) miracle of the human brain. It is too valuable just to be tossed away like a used tissue. But who will speak for science when the barbarian is already inside the gate?<br />

<br />
Not so good, it would seem. See here from the Wall Street Journal:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121400301547793343.html" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121400301547793343.html</a><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000">Smokestack Al - Environmentalists are constantly telling us that major reductions in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be made fairly painlessly, so the case of one former Vice President is instructive.<br />
<br />
Al Gore made headlines last year when the Tennessee Center for Policy Research disclosed just how much energy the &quot;Inconvenient Truth&quot; auteur consumes in his giant new palace in the Nashville suburbs. Mr. Gore responded at the time by assuring the public that he was purchasing &quot;offsets&quot; to make up for his energy-guzzling ways.<br />
<br />
Well, this week the Tennessee Center's Drew Johnson checked in on Mr. Gore again. <b>And despite an alleged program of greenification â€“ including geothermal systems, solar panels and lots and lots of nifty compact fluorescent bulbs â€“ Mr. Gore's electricity use from the grid was up 10% in 2007 compared to the year before.</b> At this rate, he'll never hit his Kyoto targets. <b>His Tennessee home currently eats up 17,768 kilowatt-hours of electricity every month â€“ about 50% more electricity than the average household consumes in an entire year.</b> That's one inconvenient carbon footprint. (Wall Street Journal)</span><br />
<br />
THIS is the guy who &quot;elitists&quot; believe deserves an Acadamy Award and Nobel Peace Prize???? THIS is the guy you are going to blindly follow when he tells you &quot;we have a crisis and we have to cut back energy use&quot;? If you ask me, Al Gore (and not the energy company CEOs) is the one who should be put on trial... and then be lead to the gallows so that he cannot waste any more energy in his McMansion! If you ask me, hypocrites this big should be shot at dawn.<br />
<br />
RMT<br />
<br />
PS - In comparison to Fat Albert Gore, let me just say that I have GENERATED a net 30 kW-hours of electricity so far this year. That's right, NET. That means after using all the energy I need from my solar panels to power my house (and even a high-current pool filter) I was still able to give back more than I needed! Where the eff is MY Nobel Prize and Oscar, Fat Albert???</div>

oh my goodness!! that is an extremely ridiculous amount. i use just a little more than that in a year, 20,000 kilowatt-hours.<br />

<br />
oh mah god! thats totally not fair ray! yup, ima drooling right now...<br />
<br />
i would love to convert my home to solar energy, but its a tad too expensive for me. i hope to have at least a decent sized panel and a 12v array up in the next 5 years though. i hear they have found a new material for solar panels and they are about to get alot cheaper.<br />
<br />
btw, would you care to give us an overview of your system? i'd love to hear about it. that is alot of net energy for solar panels. yup, your rich...  :yum:<br />

you definitely get a gold star AND a cookie for that!</div>

</div>Thanks!  I like chocolate chip, please! <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big grin    :D" /><br />
<br />
As for an overview, my system is pretty simple.  I have 33 PV panels, each one is rated to generate approximately 100 Watts at a given solar incidence angle.  So the maximum possible output of my system is 3.3 KW.  The panels are arranged in two sets of series daisy chains, 14 in one chain and 19 in the other.  This is like putting batteries in series.  Each set runs through a big DC disconnect (switch) box and then over to their respective static inverters.  Essentially, these boxes convert the VDC to the 120 VAC that is compatible with the grid and my household loads.  The output from each static inverter then runs through its own AC circuit breaker in a breakout box next to my main circuit breaker panel where my meter is.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much all there is to it, other than the grounding straps that come together on my roof and tie to the ground bar in my box.  On a clear, hot sunny day here in SoCal the meter can be seen racing backwards.  But even on a somewhat cloudy day I can generate more power than I use and it will spin backwards, albeit at a slower rate.<br />
<br />
So there you go!  Al Gore can eat my shorts! <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

			I have 33 PV panels, each one is rated to generate approximately 100 Watts at a given solar incidence angle. So the maximum possible output of my system is 3.3 KW. The panels are arranged in two sets of series daisy chains, 14 in one chain and 19 in the other. This is like putting batteries in series. Each set runs through a big DC disconnect (switch) box and then over to their respective static inverters. Essentially, these boxes convert the VDC to the 120 VAC that is compatible with the grid and my household loads. The output from each static inverter then runs through its own AC circuit breaker in a breakout box next to my main circuit breaker panel where my meter is.

Does your power company have to give you a special meter that has a connection for your self generated power?   If so, can you buy the other components online?  And are all the connections between the parts standardized so they 'snap' together or is it more cutting any wires and twisting them together?  I'm really curious how quick it would pay for itself up here in Canada, even if it was 20 years it might be worth it...<br />
<br />
Also, if the main grid fails, and it's a sunny day, is your power interrupted at all?  Is it like a UPS for your entire house in that sense?</div>

<br />
i know this questions for ray, but i have a little experience with the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;If so, can you buy the other components online?&quot; <br />
<br />
yes, you can buy everything you need online.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And are all the connections between the parts standardized so they 'snap' together or is it more cutting any wires and twisting them together?&quot;<br />
<br />
it would be cutting wires, though some more expensive models come with easier connectors.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm really curious how quick it would pay for itself up here in Canada, even if it was 20 years it might be worth it...&quot;<br />
<br />
they pay for themselves fairly quickly, but the problem is getting the money to build such a system. solar panels are very expensive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, if the main grid fails, and it's a sunny day, is your power interrupted at all? Is it like a UPS for your entire house in that sense?&quot;<br />
<br />
that depends on if you put your excess solar energy into a battery backup system. in a setup like rays, you dont even need the power company anymore.</div>

Hey there Steve! <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /><br />

			Does your power company have to give you a special meter that has a connection for your self generated power?
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Nope. Same meter. It all just ties into the AC breaker box.  So if you get more power coming in it forces the meter backwards. However, you do have to go through a application and certification process with the power company, so they know WHY you are having a net NEGATIVE power usage!  They put you on a program called &quot;net metering&quot;.  I get a statement of power usage each month, and I still pay about $1.25 per month for being connected to the grid.  But at the end of a calendar year I essentially get a check back from them that pretty much covers 12 months of grid-connect fees, and buys me a six pack or two.<br />
<br />

	</div>
</div>As ruthless said, you can buy all the components you need for such a system online (panels, static inverters, switch disconnects, etc.).  However, you need good design installation drawings to go through the application and cert process with the power company.  So if you are a good engineer, doing it yourself can save $.  I did not want the hassle when I did my SoCal home in 2003, so I had a 3rd party supplier put it all together, certify it, and install it.  But for the place I am building in COlorado, I plan to do all the engineering myself.<br />
<br />
 

<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Not all &quot;snap together&quot;.  Still a fair amount of labor, especially if you are going to install on a roof.  Installing the roof jacks for the panels to mount on.  SOME wire stripping and large cable connections through the switchbox.  Nothing terribly complex.  Just keep the juice OFF while working! <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I did my analysis back in 2003 based on 1 year's worth of power usage data for my home.  At that time I calculated approximately 15 year payback, and that included the cost of money (interest).  Not bad, given the panels are good for 30+ years!  So it was a no brainer.  Of course, now that power rates are going UP, that means my buyback time becomes shorter.<br />
<br />

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>If the grid goes down, the power from the panels services MY loads in my home first.  So yes, if the grid was down on a sunny day my appliances keep going.  However, if it goes down at night, I am dead like anyone else.  More on this in my reply to ruthless.<br />

			another question for ray. do you use any capacitors in this system? and what kind of batteries do you use? whats their rating? if you know off the top of your head.

</div>The system I have in my SoCal home is only what is called a &quot;grid-tie&quot; system.  No energy storage in batteries or caps.  So as I said, if the grid goes down at night, I am screwed.<br />
<br />
However, the system I am designing to put on my roof in Colorado (I leave for CO tonight to supervise construction) will include a computerized smart-switch, with a battery charger and a bank of 12 automotive (12 VDC) batteries.  So I plan to be able to be fully off-grid there in CO.  We will see how it goes! <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

wish i could help, i love doing stuff like that.<br />
<br />
are you using regular car batteries, or deep cycle marine batteries? i hear deep cycle batteries last alot longer, and if you pair it up with a good capacitor before the inverter, it should be a nice setup.<br />
<br />
a few more questions. how many batteries? what is the amp hour rating for the batteries? and where in the heck do you get a power inverter big enough to run an entire house?! i bet that thing costs a fortune.</div>

</div>The most popular model for grid-tie solar PV systems are the &quot;Sunny Boy&quot; inverters:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://store.altenergystore.com/Inverters/On-Grid-Grid-Intertie-No-Batteries/2001W-to-4000W/Sunny-Boy-3800U-38kW-Grid-Tie-Inverter/p1111/?source=froogle" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://store.altenergystore.com/Inverters/On-Grid-Grid-Intertie-No-Batteries/2001W-to-4000W/Sunny-Boy-3800U-38kW-Grid-Tie-Inverter/p1111/?source=froogle</a><br />
<br />
Now this one is quite large (3.8KW), but you can still see the price is fairly reasonable (given that a whole solar PV system runs into the $20K+ range).  I have older models of the Sunny Boy, and I have two of them, each with a different max power rating.  Choosing and sizing an inverter to match your panel supplies is critical, because if it is not properly matched for your average power levels, you will lose a lot of energy via heat through the DC-AC inversion/conversion process.<br />
<br />
Will try to get to your other questions tonight...<br />

<br />
too bad you lose alot of power either way.<br />
<br />
and oh mah god at the price of that power inverter!!!<br />
<br />
im almost impressed at that thing. 1600 watts rms is kinda puny, but everything else looks nice, except the 3%thd... <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite3" alt=":(" title="Frown    :(" /><br />
<br />
i'd suggest keeping this bad boy under air conditioning. i imagine it gets hot. i dont know if they under rate their products, but i sure hope they do. i couldnt even run my room off that thing, let alone my house lol.<br />
<br />
800 watts for 1 pc.<br />
500 watts for the crappy pc.<br />
60 watts for the super jank tv.<br />
48 watts for the gamecube.<br />
88 for the horrid el-cheapo stereo.<br />
200 watts worth of lights.<br />
<br />
and im not even going to add the 3000 watts <a href="mailto:rms@1ohm">rms@1ohm</a> subwoofer amp. i cant even run it at quarter power without clipping. but i have a piece of crap 30 amp converter.  too bad i dont have a car anymore. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite3" alt=":(" title="Frown    :(" /></div>

I wonder if I could I read the meter on my own house a couple times to figure out how much power I'm using over an hour?  I've never taken a close look at it.  I suppose I could dig up an old bill but I want to find out my max/avg/low, just for my own curiosity.<br />
<br />
How much do you pay for a kw hour?  I think up here it's anywhere from 20-&gt;30 cents.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice to have a small calculator app that asks for your average consumption, your cost per kwh, your lat/long and then reports how much you have to spend, and how quick you will make it all back.  After you said 15 years to earn the $ back I'm worried there won't be enough daylight hours in Canada to justify the cost.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Al Gore Has No Clothes!</b><br />
<br />
The &quot;Man Made Global Warming&quot; myth (Cornspiracy!) is in its death throes.  The politicization of science will not stand, because there are TOO MANY scientists who are too ethical to allow this to happen.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Myth+of+Consensus+Explodes+APS+Opens+Global+Warming+Debate/article12403.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dailytech.com/Myth+of+Consensus+Explodes+APS+Opens+Global+Warming+Debate/article12403.htm</a><br />
<br />
<b>Myth of Consensus Explodes: APS Opens Global Warming Debate</b><br />
<br />
 <span style="color: #0000ff"> The American Physical Society, an organization representing nearly 50,000 physicists, has reversed its stance on climate change and is now proclaiming that many of its members disbelieve in human-induced global warming.  The APS is also sponsoring public debate on the validity of global warming science.  The leadership of the society had previously called the evidence for global warming &quot;incontrovertible.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a posting to the APS forum, editor Jeffrey Marque explains,&quot;There is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the IPCC conclusion that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for global warming that has occurred since the Industrial Revolution.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The APS is opening its debate with the publication of a paper by Lord Monckton of Brenchley, which concludes that climate sensitivity -- the rate of temperature change a given amount of greenhouse gas will cause -- has been grossly overstated by IPCC modeling.   A low sensitivity implies additional atmospheric CO2 will have little effect on global climate.<br />
<br />
Larry Gould, Professor of Physics at the University of Hartford and Chairman of the New England Section of the APS, called Monckton's paper an &quot;expose of the IPCC that details numerous exaggerations and &quot;extensive errors&quot;<br />
<br />
In an email to DailyTech, Monckton says, &quot;I was dismayed to discover that the IPCC's 2001 and 2007 reports did not devote chapters to the central 'climate sensitivity' question, and did not explain in proper, systematic detail the methods by which they evaluated it. When I began to investigate, it seemed that the IPCC was deliberately concealing and obscuring its method.&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
According to Monckton, there is substantial support for his results, &quot;in the peer-reviewed literature, most articles on climate sensitivity conclude, as I have done, that climate sensitivity must be harmlessly low.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monckton, who was the science advisor to Britain's Thatcher administration, says natural variability is the cause of most of the Earth's recent warming.   &quot;In the past 70 years the Sun was more active than at almost any other time in the past 11,400 years ... Mars, Jupiter, Neptune's largest moon, and Pluto warmed at the same time as Earth.&quot;</span> <br />
<br />
 <span style="color: #ff0000"> Lord Monckton's paper reveals that â€“<br />
<br />
-    The IPCC's 2007 climate summary overstated CO2's impact on temperature by 500-2000%;<br />
-    CO2 enrichment will add little more than 1 °F (0.6 °C) to global mean surface temperature by 2100;<br />
-    Not one of the three key variables whose product is climate sensitivity can be measured directly;<br />
-    The IPCC's values for these key variables are taken from only four published papers, not 2,500;<br />
-    The IPCC's values for each of the three variables, and hence for climate sensitivity, are overstated;<br />
-    &quot;Global warming&quot; halted ten years ago, and surface temperature has been falling for seven years;<br />
-    Not one of the computer models relied upon by the IPCC predicted so long and rapid a cooling;<br />
-    The IPCC inserted a table into the scientists' draft, overstating the effect of ice-melt by 1000%;<br />
-    It was proved 50 years ago that predicting climate more than two weeks ahead is impossible;<br />
-    Mars, Jupiter, Neptune's largest moon, and Pluto warmed at the same time as Earth warmed;<br />
-    In the past 70 years the Sun was more active than at almost any other time in the past 11,400 years.</span> <br />

That's pretty big news.<br />

Greed will put an end to the scam eventually.  As soon as producers realize how much money they can save in packaging costs when they finally convince consumers they are being selfish by not using refillable containers.  And when the cost of PVC's scale to the point where large investors can get involved.</div>

</div>Not only that: But any &quot;science&quot; that is promoted by a &quot;scientist&quot; who refuses to release his raw data, and merely wants you to &quot;trust him&quot; that he did the right calculations, without error, must be immediately thrown in the trash as non-veridical science.<br />
<br />
REAL scientists are not only NOT afraid to release all their data, and their calculations, but they actually welcome other people checking their work in case they may have actually made an error.  These idiots from East Anglia University CRU with their stories of &quot;oh the dog ate the data&quot; and other ruses to avoid FULL DISCLOSURE are doing so much damage to the public perception of science that it makes me VERY VERY angry!   <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite4" alt=":mad:" title="Mad    :mad:" /><br />

And it just keeps coming. Here we have James Lovelock, creator of the Gaia hypothesis and well-known climate scientist:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/mar/29/james-lovelock-climate-change" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/mar/29/james-lovelock-climate-change</a><br />
<br />
He says that humans are too stupid to prevent climate change and that &quot;it may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while&quot;. There you have it, it's completely political. Of course, that was clear when Al Gore was promoting things.<br />
<br />
I would love to find a way to get people to stop fearing science and stop believing bogus science. Any effective ways to do that? (The challenge, I think, is that true scientists are generally not attention-seekers and thus stay out of the limelight.)</div>

			And it just keeps coming. Here we have James Lovelock, creator of the Gaia hypothesis and well-known climate scientist:<br />
(snip)<br />
He says that humans are too stupid to prevent climate change and that &quot;it may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while&quot;. There you have it, it's completely political. Of course, that was clear when Al Gore was promoting things.

</div>Oh yeah. I also saw that story today.  Amazing at the same time it is frightening.  Now, in the USA the Democrats are always claiming that what Obama is doing is &quot;not socialism.&quot;  Well, given this story by someone of the same political ilk, they could be right... sounds more like FASCISM to me!!! <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite9" alt=":eek:" title="Eek!    :eek:" /><br />
<br />
It has always been about politics, money, and control.  Which is, of course, why Al Gore is the biggest proponent of the bogus AGW theory.  How any &quot;honest&quot; liberal could NOT have seen that right off the bat is beyond me.  But for them to continue to support this nonsense... well, it would seem that they may actually agree they need to be controlled.<br />
<br />
So let's just control all those people who vote to be subject to it?  The rest of us continue to live free!  Deal? <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big grin    :D" /><br />

</div>Of course.  It calls for MORE basic science education so that you understand it well enough to know that you do not have to merely &quot;believe&quot; people...but rather look at the data on your own.  Unfortunately, in the USA, we have continually dumbed-down science education, requiring less and less of new students.  And it shows in our continual slide in our education levels falling behind the rest of the world.<br />

</div>Exactly true.  If they have done their science job correctly, and completely, they <b>do not need the limelight</b> for their data and their analysis stand on their own as testament to their correctness.  If one has basic science education, one does not need anyone to &quot;interpret&quot; science that is properly documented such that nothing is withheld from view.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>And Now...UK Gov speaks on ClimateGate!</b><br />
<br />
Well,<br />
<br />
We certainly have a tradition of the USA and UK being very close.  Close allies in war and trade.  Close in the values we share.  Even fairly close in our forms of government.  But who knew JUST how close our governments were!  Because now it is clear the UK government is JUST AS COMPLETELY BROKEN AND CORRUPT AS OURS!<br />
<br />
Here is a link to the <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/03/30/results-of-the-climategate-paliamentary-inquiry-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">UK Parliamentary Inquiry into Climategate.</a><br />
<br />
Here are a couple of the most choice quotes from the esteemed MPs who participated in this whitewash:<br />
<br />
 <span style="color: #ff0000"> &quot;The focus on Professor Jones and CRU has been largely misplaced. &quot; </span> <br />
<br />
Even though investigators have said he willfully violated UK FOIA laws, but because the law was written with a 6 month statute of limitations for prosecution, they could not legally prosecute him.  I see.  He actually broke the law, but the law lets him skate, and so then the focus is misplaced.  Interesting, that.  But here is the best:<br />
<br />
 <span style="color: #ff0000"> &quot;On the accusations relating to Professor Jones's refusal to share raw data and computer codes, the Committee considers that his actions were in line with common practice in the climate science community but that those practices need to change.&quot; </span> <br />
<br />
So let me see if I get this opinion correct:<br />
1) For at least two centuries (I am being conservative), the Scientific Method has clearly stated that you openly share your data and methods, not only to allow people to catch errors, but to show you are not fudging anything.<br />
2) Even though the entire rest of the world's scientific community has known about these standards, and more or less obeyed them, it was fine and dandy for a specialized segment of science (which did not exist more than 4 decades ago) to violate that rules because they had their own &quot;common practice.&quot;<br />
3) We are admitting that those practices need to change (but not saying they were wrong at the time?), and we don't really much care about the reason why Jones was being so secretive with the data (not to mention outright lying).<br />
<br />
Amazing.  But still there is more that is hard to reconcile with how I thought science was supposed to be practiced:<br />
<br />
 <span style="color: #ff0000"> &quot;On the mishandling of Freedom of Information (FoI) requests, the Committee considers that much of the responsibility should lie with the University, not CRU. The leaked e-mails appear to show a culture of non-disclosure at CRU and instances where information may have been deleted to avoid disclosure, particularly to climate change sceptics. The failure of the University to grasp fully the potential damage this could do and did was regrettable. &quot; </span> <br />
<br />
Howzat????  So it was the failure of the Uni to &quot;grasp fully&quot; that their CRU employees were acting unethically... THAT is the big problem?  Not the fact that the CRU people were actually acting unethically?  So CRU gets a pass because their &quot;parents&quot; did not catch them pulling the cat's tail?  WOW.<br />
<br />
Un-frickin-believable.  Democracy is dead, folks.  Once the government refuses to admit errors in how their self-funded science is being done, then things will only become more totalitarian from here on out.<br />

That was a disgusting read. Must say I agree with what you've said.<br />
<br />
Also, you're right about more basic scientific education being needed. However, with people like those at CRU tainting the image of scientists, combined with education cuts in various places due to economic hardship, the future looks bleak.<br />

			"articleBody": "I constantly wonder when people will push for evidence that:\n\na) Global Warming is REAL (remember the 70s when the same group of social elites were warning of the coming ice age?)\nb) That any sort of \"climate change\" is primarily due to mankind (Anthropic Global Warming) instead of the sun.\n\nThis article is well done.  And it should work to put the spotlight on \"climate change\" freaks as the priests of a new religion...\n\nRMT\n\n  Global Warming as Religion and not Science  \n\nMen never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.\nBlaise Pascal\n\nIt was Michael Crichton who first prominently identified environmentalism as a religion. That was in a speech in 2003, but the world has moved on apace since then and adherents of the creed now have a firm grip on the world at large.\n\nGlobal Warming has become the core belief in a new eco-theology. The term is used as shorthand for anthropogenic (or man made) global warming. It is closely related to other modern belief systems, such as political correctness, chemophobia and various other forms of scaremongering, but it represents the vanguard in the assault on scientific man.\nThe activists now prefer to call it \"climate change\". This gives them two advantages:\n1.	It allows them to seize as \"evidence\" the inevitable occurrences of unusually cold weather as well as warm ones.\n2.	The climate is always changing, so they must be right.\nOnly the relatively elderly can remember the cynical haste with which the scaremongers dropped the \"coming ice age\" and embraced exactly the opposite prediction, but aimed at the same culprit â€“ industry. This was in Britain, which was the cradle of the new belief and was a response to the derision resulting from the searing summer of 1976. The father of the new religion was Sir Crispin Tickell, and because he had the ear of Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who was engaged in a battle with the coal miners and the oil sheiks, it was introduced into international politics with the authority of the only major political leader holding a qualification in science. The introduction was timely yet ironic since, in the wake of the world's political upheavals, a powerful new grouping of left-wing interests was coalescing around environmental issues. The result was a new form of godless religion. The global warming cult has the characteristics of religion and not science for the following reasons.\n\nFaith and scepticism\n\nFaith is a belief held without evidence. The scientific method, a loose collection of procedures of great variety, is based on precisely the opposite concept, as famously declared by Thomas Henry Huxley:\nThe improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority, as such. For him, scepticism is the highest of duties; blind faith the one unpardonable sin. \nHuxley was one of a long tradition of British sceptical philosophers.  From the Bacons, through the likes of Locke, Hume and Russell, to the magnificent climax of Popper's statement of the principle of falsifiability, the scientific method was painfully established, only to be abandoned in a few short decades. It is one of the great ironies of modern history that the nation that was the cradle of the scientific method came to lead the process of its abandonment. The great difference, then, is that religion demands belief, while science requires disbelief. There is a great variety of faiths. Atheism is just as much a faith as theism. There is no evidence either way. There is no fundamental clash between faith and science â€“ they do not intersect. The difficulties arise, however, when one pretends to be the other.\nThe Royal Society, as a major part of the flowering of the tradition, was founded on the basis of scepticism. Its motto \"On the word of no one\" was a stout affirmation. Now suddenly, following their successful coup, the Greens have changed this motto of centuries to one that manages to be both banal and sinister â€“ \"Respect the facts.\" When people start talking about \"the facts\" it is time to start looking for the fictions. Real science does not talk about facts; it talks about observations, which might turn out to be inaccurate or even irrelevant.\nThe global warmers like to use the name of science, but they do not like its methods. They promote slogans such a \"The science is settled\" when real scientists know that science is never settled. They were not, however, always so wise. In 1900, for example, the great Lord Kelvin famously stated, \"There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.\" Within a few years classical physics was shattered by Einstein and his contemporaries. Since then, in science, the debate is never closed.\nThe world might (or might not) have warmed by a fraction of a degree. This might (or might not) be all (or in part) due to the activities of mankind. It all depends on the quality of observations and the validity of various hypotheses. Science is at ease with this situation. It accepts various theories, such as gravitation or evolution, as the least bad available and of the most practical use, but it does not believe. Religion is different.\n\nSin and absolution\n\nIt is in the nature of religion to be authoritarian and proscriptive. Essential to this is the concept of sin â€“ a transgression in thought or deed of theological principles.\nOriginal sin in the older religions derived from one of the founts of life on earth â€“ sex. The new religion goes even further back to the very basis of all life â€“ carbon. Perhaps the fundamental human fear is fear of life itself. The amazing propensity of carbon to form compounds of unlimited complexity made the existence of life possible, while its dioxide is the primary foodstuff, the very start of the food chain. Every item of nutriment you consume started out as atmospheric carbon dioxide. It is therefore the ideal candidate for original sin, since no one can escape dependence on it. This manna that gave us life is now regularly branded in media headlines as \"pollution\" and \"toxic\": surely one of the most perverse dysphemisms in the history of language.\nThe corrective to sin in religion is absolution, and the power of most religions comes from their claim to have the monopoly on absolution. So it is with the new godless religion. Furthermore, it is in the nature of religion to create false markets. In the time of Chaucer the Pardoner sold papal indulgences, which freed the prosperous from the consequences of sin. Likewise, the new pardoners sell carbon offsets. As in so much of both ancient and modern society these activities divert effort from wealth creation and so act as a drag on the economy. They also grant to the rich a comfort that is not available to the poor â€“ a sure road to success.\n\nProselytes and evangelists\n\nMost religions seek to grow by means of proselytism. Science does not seek or need converts. It teaches those that are willing to learn, but it does not impose itself on those who are indifferent. Religions (at least those that are successful) have a different imperative. A growing cohort of believers reinforces the beliefs of existing adherents and participating in the quest for converts helps assuage the inevitable doubts they might harbour. Successful religions are structured to encompass this expansionary mechanism. Those who can recruit others to the cause are therefore held in high regard.\n\nDemagogues and hypocrites\n\nDemagoguery is also, therefore, a feature of religion. Some people have the capacity to hold the masses in their thrall. It is a mysterious art, as their skills of oratory do not often stand up to any sort of critical examination. They are idols of the moment, who often turn out to have feet of clay, as so frequently seems to happen with charismatic TV preachers.\nOne of the most notorious demagogues of the godless religion is Al Gore. He is certainly no great orator, but he makes up for it with chutzpah. His disregard for truth is exemplified by his characteristic and ubiquitous pose in front of a satellite photograph of hurricane Katrina. Even some of the most vehement climate \"scientists\" refrain from connecting that particular isolated and monstrously tragic event with global warming. Likewise his Old Testament style prophecies of further disasters, such as floods due to a rise in sea level, greatly exceed the more modest claims of the \"professionals\". As in the overthrow of the cities of the plain and other biblical prophecies, Gore promises a rain of fire and brimstone on us, unless we change our ways.\nGore also displays all the characteristics of the classical religious hypocrite. He disregards his own proscriptions with abandonment and ostentation. By his own measure (carbon footprint) his sins are great; at least twenty times those of the average American. It is all right though, because he purchases absolution (carbon offsets) through his own company. As he is a private individual it is not known whether he profits directly, but at a minimum he does not pay out of his taxable income and, worst of all, he demonstrates that the rich are immune from any of the actual privations that attachment to the new religion visits upon its poorer adherents. This is also not unknown in traditional religions and has been a source of material for satirists throughout the centuries.\n\nInfidels and apostates\n\nReligions vary in their treatment of unbelievers, which ranges from disregard to slaughter. The new religion relies at present on verbal assault and character assassination, though there are those who would go further. They call the infidels \"deniers\" â€“ a cheap and quite despicable verbal reference to the Holocaust. There is a sustained campaign to deny the deniers any sort of public platform for their views.\nApostates are universally even more reviled than infidels. They have turned their backs on the true faith, whichever that might happen to be. Partial apostates, or heretics, are even more loathed and through the ages have been subjected to the most appalling punishments and deaths.  In the case of the \"sceptical environmentalist\", Bjorn Lomborg, he is of the faith. In fact he is a serial believer; accepting, for example, that eating celery causes two percent of all cancers and, of course, that global warming is man made, but he rejects the sacrificing of humanity to the belief. This is unacceptable! What are a few million deaths from dirty water, mosquito bites and other hazards so long as people can be made to conform? So far he has only been assaulted with insults and custard pies. Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace, broke with the movement over its growing anti-human, anti-scientific tendencies and drift into extremism. The last straw for him was the campaign against chlorine, not only an essential component of human life but also the basis of one of the most dramatically life-saving hygienic interventions. He has, consequently, been subjected to a prolonged campaign of vilification, described as an eco-Judas, turncoat and traitor. Every minor commentator or blogger who manifests disbelief can expect to be the target of abuse from self-appointed protectors of the creed.\n\nSacrifice and ritual\n\nIt is part of human nature that we do not like to admit making a mistake, even to ourselves. So if, for example, we buy a magic device that by some mysterious means improves the fuel efficiency of our car, we drive a little more conservatively in order to prove that we have not been had. Religions exploit this weakness as a means creating and reinforcing commitment. If someone can be induced or coerced into making a sacrifice they then have a stake in the cause.\nWindmills, for example, are the symbols of power, not physical power (of which they are derisorily short) but political and religious power. They are like the great domes of temples, the statues of Saddam or the big \"M\" arch of MacDonald's. Windmills are ugly: they destroy the visual (and aural) landscape, but that is their purpose. They are part of the sacrifice. It would not be so bad if they were simply useless, but it is worse than that. Conventional generating systems of equivalent power have to operate for 80% of the time, while the wind is blowing too soft or too hard, and then be switched to warm standby when it is just right, an expensive and wasteful process. Windmills are there to remind us of our commitment, willing or not, to the cause, both in excessive taxation and loss of visual and aural amenity.\nAs in other forms of mental conditioning, continued reinforcement is a necessary part of the process and that is where ritual comes in. Ritual comprises tiny sacrifices infinitely repeated. Going round the house switching off standby lights performs the same function as the repetitive chanting of mantras. The fact that it is pointless is the whole point.\nOne of the most valuable ideas of modern engineering, lost in the noise, has been lost in the noise. In most applications a change of, say, one part in ten thousand is too small to be measured and therefore not worthy of concern. If standby in domestic devices ever were a problem, it is now a rapidly diminishing one. In the old days of thermionic devices (valves or tubes) it was necessary to keep cathodes heated to avoid a prolonged warming up period, but transistors and LCDs do not have cathodes and are therefore instantly available. Present standby powers are about five watts. In the temperate zone that is transferred from your central heating bill for half the year, though it is barely enough to keep your big toe warm. In fact, it would be relatively easy to make the standby power microwatts, just enough to power an optical sensor and decoder, though until now nobody thought such a pointless exercise necessary.\n\nProphecy and divination\n\nIn the real world attempts at prophecy always come to a bad end. Only in religious texts and the currently popular fantasy fiction do prophecies come true. H G Wells, in The shape of things to come, successfully predicted the mechanised War, as did Winston Churchill, but little else, and the film that Wells closely supervised now provides rather comic entertainment (but wonderful music). Even those of us closely involved in electronics did not foresee that a development of the ancient art of writing on stone, lithography, would result in millions of transistors being available on one chip, changing the world forever, including granting new and sinister means of control to those in authority.\nLikewise, divination was greatly regarded in all cultures, ancient and modern. Stars were observed, chickens and other animals slaughtered, so that their steaming entrails could be examined to predict the future, cards were shuffled and crystal balls peered into. Comparatively recently the leader of the most powerful nation on earth relied on the advice of astrologers.\nNow divination has returned with, for example, the examination of the entrails of ancient trees. Though the methods used are invalid (they wrongly assume linearity) and have been comprehensively shown to be irreproducible and misleading, the results have been paraded before the world in defence of draconian sacrificial policies.\nThe main form of modern divination, however, is computer models. Forty odd years ago an instruction passed round the Faculty of Engineering of the University of London that no PhDs were to be awarded on the basis of computer models unsupported by measurement. As T S Eliot asked in Choruses from The Rock\nWhere is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?\nWhere is the knowledge we have lost in information?\nNow, huge and generously funded university and government departments do nothing but develop computer models, involving assumptions about physical interactions that are still not understood by science. Their dubious (to say the least) results are used by the new international priesthood to frighten the people into conformity.\n\nPuritans and killjoys\n\nNo one has bettered Mencken's definition of Puritanism â€“ the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy. It is an unfortunate characteristic of many varieties of religion that this characteristic is to the fore and Global Warming is far from being an exception. Nothing the proponents offer involves an improvement or even maintenance of human contentment, quite the opposite in fact. You might think that any philosophy of life would involve swings and roundabouts, good and bad, but think again. Virtually everything you enjoy is now sinful â€“ holidays, driving your car, having a comfortable temperature in your home, being free from the stink of rotting garbage, and on and on.\nAs with the flagellants of old, for some people a feeling of self-righteousness not only transcends all discomforts, but derives from them. The rest of us have to be coerced into conformity.\nIt is an unfortunate fact of life that there are people who get their kicks out of pushing other people around. The existence of little pleasures of life, such as savouring a fine wine or cigar (and even more so the proletarian equivalents) is intolerable to them. They will exploit any means â€“ the distortion of science, the suborning of weak politicians, the repetition of mendacious propaganda â€“ to achieve the elimination of the hated practices. The eleventh commandment for the killjoys is \"Thou shalt not have fun\", and global warming provides a delightful playground for them.\n\nCensorship and angles\n\nFreedom of speech and publication is at the very heart of science. Even the most foolish of hypotheses is allowed to be offered for examination. In much of religion the opposite is true; challenging the established dogma is heresy, for which the punishment has ranged from ostracism to horrific torture and death. One of the greatest ironies produced by the successful policy of entryism by the eco-theologians is that it is none other than the Royal Society that has been orchestrating the attempt to censor any deviation from establishment beliefs. Authoritarian politicians, such as Congressman Brad Miller, would give such suppression the force of law.\nIt is a curious repetition of history that those who advance the hypothesis that the sun is the controlling element in changes of climate are vilified, just as Galileo was, for supporting the Copernican heliocentric description of the solar system. Yet the sun is clearly the driver for climate â€“ if it stopped shining, the earth's temperature would drop to near absolute zero. In the establishment dogma the sun is barely mentioned, while the puny efforts of mankind are gratuitously magnified out of proportion. In a scientific approach to climate, a full understanding of the behaviour of that solitary driver would be the first prerequisite, but this is waived in the interests of piety; so leading solar researchers have been deprived of funding.\nOne of the most exploited ways of angling the news is by \"ratchet reporting\". News of unusual warm weather, for example,  is given copious coverage, while cold weather is studiously ignored. Thus the spring of  2007 was disastrously cold in parts of North America, with ice-bound ships and snowed-off baseball, but this was kept secret from the British, whose wonderful summery April was presented as though it were bad news (and that in the land of rheumatism and bronchitis!). The fact that Britain had no spring at all in 2006 was conveniently forgotten, except as a basis of comparison to establish that 2007 was substantially warmer.\nThat the media know that they are peddling untruths is demonstrated by these tricks they get up to. If they were confident of the truth of their case there would be no need to fake the coverage. They have been frequently caught out faking their numbers and graphs, but only a few internet surfers know about it. If you think you have a good case, you can afford to present both sides, but they don't. The great majority of the population have no idea that there is an alternative view. That is not science, it is religion.\n\nControl and taxation\n\nReligion has always played an important part in the imposition of authority. For many centuries it took the form of the \"Divine Right of Kings\" or the \"Mandate of Heaven\". Once you get the people to believe, you can get away with almost any imposition. The alliance between the shaman and the legislator has long been the very foundation of authoritarianism. Even when the dogma is a godless one, such as Marxism, it is imposed with religious fervour, for that is the way to induce conformity.\nPeople now accept laws that restrict their liberty and standard of living, which would once have provoked riots, because they are cloaked in a quasi-religious formula of environmentalism. So-called environmental burdens, for example, now greatly outweigh the incremental effect of the poll tax that met with such violent opposition in England, yet are now meekly accepted, as is the parasitic presence of various forms of snooper, who even invade people's dustbins.\n\nContradictions and irrationality\n\nTraditional religions not only tolerated contradiction and irrationality, they embrace them as part of the mystique. Words and phrases are repeated ad nauseam and in strange contexts, until they lose all meaning and become self-preserving mantras. \nContradictions and irrationality also abound in the modern theocratic world. The EU, for example, gratuitously destroys a tiny industry making traditional barometers, on the grounds of an irrational fear of mercury, then imposes the use of fluorescent light bulbs that distribute that same dreaded substance in huge quantities across the continent, all on the basis of the threat of global warming.\nPeople who have never heard of Wien or Planck confidently assert that it is \"obvious\" that man-made CO2 will cause runaway warming of the planet, when it is not at all obvious to many who are familiar with the works of those gentlemen. It is obvious in the sense that it is obvious that believers will have everlasting life or that a senseless act of self-immolation will earn the eternal attentions of 72 virgins in Paradise. The capacity to believe six impossible things before breakfast has been restored from fantasy to accepted normality.\n\nWealth and power\n\nSome organisms develop the ingredients to survive and multiply, so it is with business and religions. It is characteristic of businesses that they dispose of the entrepreneurs who create them and are taken over by a different breed of corporate manager: so it is with religions. The brutally suppressed troglodytes who were the early Christians of Rome were a different breed from the cardinals, bishops and abbots who bestrode mediaeval Europe and lived the opulent life. There were also, of course, the humble and saintly mendicant friars. The equivalents of all these varieties exist within the new movement.\nMoney is the basis of the new religion. It poured in from various foundations (the so-called ketchup money) and naÃ¯ve donors. The activists found that they had to maintain and innovate their product (anxiety) to keep the income rising, so they had to keep increasing the imaginary threats both in intensity and number. With money came power. In Britain, the political parties are all effectively bankrupt, so the temptation to hang onto the coattails of a movement with so much momentum was irresistible. Even the Conservative Party submitted to a coup that was totally alien to everything it had ever believed in.\nThe other route to power was the Trotskyite method of entryism. Once one adherent to the cause obtained a position of authority he could recruit others of a like mind. One by one the bastions of the media, and even science itself, fell to the intruders. A new breed of environmental editors achieved a monopoly of reporting in those areas that coincided with their beliefs. With powerful media organisations behind them they then also had the protection of the law to intimidate their adversaries. Opposition to the movement was largely confined to the internet and a few determined individuals in remote institutions, such as the emasculated rump of the British House of Lords.\nWith power comes patronage. At its best this has produced great architecture and art. At its worst it produces vast acres of ugly, worse than useless windmills and rigidly controlled research. What passed as scientific research a quarter of a century ago now barely exists. To get funding, your project has to conform to one of the mantra descriptions, such as \"sustainable development\". Doubters are afraid to speak out. Their institutions are dependent on millions in grants at the disposal of green officials to obtain \"appropriate\" results relevant to global warming and related scares. When your institution is involved in a fight for survival, you do not rock the boat.\nThe lavishness of the tax-funded, aviation-fuelled, international junkets enjoyed by the global warming priesthood, contrasted with the frugal gatherings of their relatively impotent scientific opponents, is the very stuff of mediaeval satire. Just as Rabelais had to go into hiding from the anger of the priesthood of his time, so critics of the new religion are largely confined to the interstices of the internet. As ever, wealth and power determine the ability to propagate one's views. It might be some small compensation for members of the resistance, cowering in the electronic maquis,  that history remembers the name of Rabelais, while his persecutors are forgotten.\n\nConfession and salvation\n\nOne of the last bastions of science to fall was the British Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Science and Manufacture. It has a Chief Executive who was formerly one of the most powerful green civil servants. It now offers its fellows the opportunity to make public confession of their sins in the form of their \"carbon footprint\". They even have a programme of \"Carbon Control\" directed at seven to fourteen year olds, urging them to take control of their carbon emissions. Young children now have nightmares about the burning planet, just as some of us once had nightmares about burning in hell unless we believed, and then lay awake at night wondering whether we believed or not, or what \"believe\" actually means. The ruthless exploitation of the receptivity of the young, and their relentless indoctrination, is one of the less pleasant characteristics of much of religion. As the Jesuits say \"Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man.\"\nHell-fire is the stick and salvation is the carrot. Perhaps the best you can say about the new religion is that the object of salvation is \"the planet\" and not just oneself.  It is also the worst you can say; for it is essentially inhuman; which is what inflames heretics like Lomborg. Science, of course is also inhuman. Science though, unlike religion, does not seek to dictate policy. It can provide information for policy-makers, such as \"If you do this, millions of Africans are likely to die\" but it does not say \"You must, or must not, do this.\" Religion, depending upon its particular variety, will say \"They must be saved\" or, while not so indelicate as to put it into words, \"Let them die.\" One of the most offensive manifestations of the new religion occurred when hundreds of the priesthood went on one of their lavish junkets in Africa, where all around them was suffering and death.\n\nEnvoi\n\nThe human spirit is sick. It soared during the enlightenment of the eighteenth century. It flowered during the nineteenth. It beat off the tyrants of the twentieth century.  Now, at an alarming rate, it is surrendering its freedoms to a concocted religion based on fraudulent science. Of course, it is not only science that has suffered in the overwhelming cultural downturn. The great artistic tradition has given way to displays of dead animals and soiled beds. In much of what passes for literature and drama, the expletives remain while the loftier aspirations of humanity are deleted. Entertainment is debased by displays of banality, cruelty and vacuous, groundless celebrity. It was science, however, that gave us lives of a length, comfort and healthiness that were unthought-of, even within human memory; a gift that is cold-bloodedly, but covertly, being denied to millions in poorer parts of the world. Extremists of the new religion regard humanity as an inconvenience or a pestilence that can be disposed of (not including themselves, of course).\nAbove all, science represented the triumph of humanity over the primitive superstitions that haunted our ancestors, a creation of pure reason, a monument to that evolutionary (or, if you prefer, God-given) miracle of the human brain. It is too valuable just to be tossed away like a used tissue. But who will speak for science when the barbarian is already inside the gate?\n\nJohn Brignell\nJune 2007",
