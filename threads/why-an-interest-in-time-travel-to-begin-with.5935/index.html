								<div class="bbWrapper">There may be several reasons as to why all of us have found ourselves as registered members of this site.  Speaking for myself, can be compared to someone that has a paranormal experience, such as a possible encounter with a ghost, and becomes curious as to what happened during the encounter and why the event took place..or the dynamics involved.<br />
<br />
I had an experience long ago, soon after a very close friend passed away.  We were very young, and one night we were sitting in one of our parents cars, and he brought up the subject of death and whether I thought there was indeed an after-life ?<br />
<br />
We talked about it, and he told me that what I said made him feel more comfortable with the concept of death and he thanked me for my input.  <br />
<br />
The whole conversation was kind of odd, especially taking his normal personality into consideration.  <br />
<br />
Whether he had a premonition of his demise ?  Don't know.  <br />
<br />
However, within a month or so, he was riding his bike home from school, and an individual ran a red light and struck him down in the crosswalk, killing my friend.  Several nights later, I was awakened to find my friend standing in my room.   Regardless of the fact that I had told him I believed there was life after death, seeing him standing there frightened me to no end.<br />
<br />
I could only lay there and stare, unable to form words to say anything to him.<br />
<br />
He seemed to become sad, and slowly faded from view.  I felt terrible, since I provided him with assurances, yet,  my fear betrayed my confidence of any possible &quot;theories&quot; of life after death, as I had conveyed to him that night while we were sitting in the car.<br />
<br />
This experience opened up a determination to learn more about the concept of life after death.  The experience preceeded any in-depth knowledge of just such an event.  Obviously, this is something that never can be proven to anyone else, other than me knowing that it happened, and through the experience alone, matters not what the skeptics say and will never alter or take away &quot;the experience&quot;.<br />
<br />
I believe this also is what has led &quot;me&quot; to Time Travel Institute.  I am not a professional scientist, and would have a lot of trouble communicating with &quot;experts&quot; in the field of physic's and related areas of discipline.  I could have registered in some sort of Scientific American type forum, but for me, wouldnt really be appropriate.  Not for the scientists nor for myself.<br />
<br />
I have had more than one experience of events that seem to have a twin set of memories.  The realization that I was experiencing an event that I &quot;knew&quot; had happened before.  Sometimes, the event plays out just as &quot;remembered&quot; or something happens slightly different, and results with a different outcome.<br />
<br />
As an example...walking down a trail, and feeling kind of odd, the memory type of image of a rattlesnake leaping out from behind a rock along the trail.  In looking ahead, such a rock is not seen.  As I continue on-ward, it becomes more and more familiar, as though I have been there before, and the objects in the landscape start to be recognized though a memory, even though I never have hiked that trail before.<br />
<br />
And then, the &quot;memory&quot; of this location is too much to ignore...and I decide to go a different way, and walk around the rock differently than I seem to be remembering, and to my astonishment, there IS a rattlesnake behind it, but since I took a different way around it, the snake is facing the wrong way, and I am able to run off and avoid any possible bite.<br />
<br />
Just as with the paranormal experience, it is something that can't be proven through &quot;standardized&quot; methods, and exists only as an individual &quot;personal&quot; experience. <br />
<br />
And just as with the paranormal experience, opens the door with a desire to not only share my experiences with others, but to also compare what happened with others who also may have experienced similar events.<br />
<br />
I couldnt tell anyone exactly exsitence is or isn't.  All I know is what happened to me, and the greatest scientist's in the world can say anything against the possiblities---however, their words will never alter &quot;the experience&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thus, here I am, a registered member of Time Travel Institute.  That others may have experienced similar oddities, of that I am certain.  That others don't, and play around with making up stories, pretending they themselves had the similar experiences and are sharing fabricated tales--of that I am certain also, and becomes somewhat of a dissappontment when I run into these fabricators.<br />
<br />
Just as with the ghost hunters that take the time to research any claims of paranormal activity, and find that the related experiences are nothing but a hoax.  <br />
<br />
I never registered with any intentions of debunking anyone's claims, but come from a point-of-view of wanting to know---and if I grill somebody, it is to determine for myself if the tale is of a real experience or a fabricated tale from somebody that &quot;wishes&quot; they had such an experience.<br />
<br />
Fictional forum, granted.  However, at least Time Travel Institute provides one way of sharing, and comparing, and at least trying to achieve something relative to the experiences.<br />
<br />
That my friend WAS standing in my room is a fact.  How and why he was there ???<br />
<br />
That &quot;something&quot; unusual seems to happen with time, is also a fact, How and why ??? <br />
<br />
Welcome to TTI !<br />
<br />
I don't know the answers to the mysteries of existence, if I did, I wouldn't be here, but be sitting somewhere smug with my vast pool of knowledge.<br />
<br />
Oh well..don't know if this post was worth the time it took to write, nor was worth the posting, but decided to do it anyway.</div>

Welcome to TTI !<br />

I don't know the answers to the mysteries of existence, if I did, I wouldn't be here, but be sitting somewhere smug with my vast pool of knowledge.<br />

Oh well..don't know if this post was worth the time it took to write, nor was worth the posting, but decided to do it anyway.<br />

</div>Well I see I am the first person to post after you. The reason I am here is because I came here wanting to voice my view. The more skepticism and non-belief I met the more I was determined to stay around. Also, at the time I was getting some pretty good input from some very smart people. I was a rebel at first then I fell in line then I became a rebel again. I don,t hold try to hold anything personal against no one. It is just words here and words is all it should be even though people get emotionally involved sometimes. <br />
<br />
I too had a ghost experience. My parents died and left me a house. My family and I moved in. At first nothing happend for a while then all of a sudden I would be watching satilite tv and notice on the phone ID my wifes cell phone calling me but her phone was on the table in the living room because no one was home and I ran and looked at it. Then my home phone was calling my wifes phone and my phone. Also I was at my desk in my sun room and I had a view into the living room. The front door opened up and shut. I thought my wife when out. Then my wife came in later from our back bedroom. It scared the you know what out of me. I took my gun and searched the house. Then later my wife and kids had a experience where the back yard door flew open and shut by itself scareing the you know what out of them. Later on our phones started calling each other again and I yelled stop it. Everything stoped and we have had nothing since then. <br />
<br />
I have always had an interest in technology and a deep longing to know what I am not suppose to know. To learn and know what is forbidden to know by a normal every day person. I started long ago collecting technology also I did a nuke site to see if I would get shut down. The main reason I started that site was to see if I could get it shut down. It is still up 9 years later. If it does get shut down I will go underground with it.<br />
<br />
After I got here and got critism I was determined to make what I started to talk about to work. And that is what I have been doing making it work. I am not going to get on my soap box and start talking because I know I am outside of most peoples point of view on my time travel claim. That is ok. I pretty much got the final code the final plan down as to how people would time travel with information. There is still so much to learn but I am only 1 person doing that in my personal time on a shoe string buget.  I have no doubts that it has been tried or considered by the underground USA goverment. The black budget technology. After my experiences with it there is no way they could not of tried it or thought about it. I will say Darby was wrong when he said the computing power was too great to accomplish it. The trick is to try to determine where the data will be as far as coordinates are concerened. On coordinates I use weak checksums and reconstruct those checksums but a much better system lays ahead as I have developed and not shared with the public which is a coordinate system for my weak checksums and the ability to calculate them as to where they are. Now I search that area the coordinates for my time travel data/files. It is like a rescue mission search. In a rescue mission they have the coordinates to begin the search and they search that area one square at a time till they find the missing people. The same is true with time travel with information. Man once you lock onto those coordinates it is time to sit back, drink a beer, and enjoy what you have found. And, when it comes to communicating with the future you can send the coordinates to the past to begin the search. The coordinates to communicate with the future or the past can be calculated has I have not proved here but have done on my own. But all is well. This is a fictional site and I believe I have said and posted way more than I should have in my time here but I still enjoy being here. But I still like being here because the news is way too boring and I can only sit and sift though my files (time travel media) for so long before I need a break. Also this site gave me the inspiration to keep going to keep trying. I want to think everyone for that. With that I think my next course should be is learning math and physics as Darby and RMT advised me and take my stuff (I would say fecis) as they would probably call it someplace else with a more science educated reader enviroment. I am sure this place has grown tired of me and wishes me to leave. At least in the eyes of the TTI staff who wants to rule everything by that I mean this forum is based on their personal convictions or beliefs of the world which I think is highly un-professional. More so as a respected person of science, a teacher, and a moderator.</div>

			"headline": "Why an interest in Time Travel to begin with...?",
			"articleBody": "There may be several reasons as to why all of us have found ourselves as registered members of this site.  Speaking for myself, can be compared to someone that has a paranormal experience, such as a possible encounter with a ghost, and becomes curious as to what happened during the encounter and why the event took place..or the dynamics involved.\n\nI had an experience long ago, soon after a very close friend passed away.  We were very young, and one night we were sitting in one of our parents cars, and he brought up the subject of death and whether I thought there was indeed an after-life ?\n\nWe talked about it, and he told me that what I said made him feel more comfortable with the concept of death and he thanked me for my input.  \n\nThe whole conversation was kind of odd, especially taking his normal personality into consideration.  \n\nWhether he had a premonition of his demise ?  Don't know.  \n\nHowever, within a month or so, he was riding his bike home from school, and an individual ran a red light and struck him down in the crosswalk, killing my friend.  Several nights later, I was awakened to find my friend standing in my room.   Regardless of the fact that I had told him I believed there was life after death, seeing him standing there frightened me to no end.\n\nI could only lay there and stare, unable to form words to say anything to him.\n\nHe seemed to become sad, and slowly faded from view.  I felt terrible, since I provided him with assurances, yet,  my fear betrayed my confidence of any possible \"theories\" of life after death, as I had conveyed to him that night while we were sitting in the car.\n\nThis experience opened up a determination to learn more about the concept of life after death.  The experience preceeded any in-depth knowledge of just such an event.  Obviously, this is something that never can be proven to anyone else, other than me knowing that it happened, and through the experience alone, matters not what the skeptics say and will never alter or take away \"the experience\".\n\nI believe this also is what has led \"me\" to Time Travel Institute.  I am not a professional scientist, and would have a lot of trouble communicating with \"experts\" in the field of physic's and related areas of discipline.  I could have registered in some sort of Scientific American type forum, but for me, wouldnt really be appropriate.  Not for the scientists nor for myself.\n\nI have had more than one experience of events that seem to have a twin set of memories.  The realization that I was experiencing an event that I \"knew\" had happened before.  Sometimes, the event plays out just as \"remembered\" or something happens slightly different, and results with a different outcome.\n\nAs an example...walking down a trail, and feeling kind of odd, the memory type of image of a rattlesnake leaping out from behind a rock along the trail.  In looking ahead, such a rock is not seen.  As I continue on-ward, it becomes more and more familiar, as though I have been there before, and the objects in the landscape start to be recognized though a memory, even though I never have hiked that trail before.\n\nAnd then, the \"memory\" of this location is too much to ignore...and I decide to go a different way, and walk around the rock differently than I seem to be remembering, and to my astonishment, there IS a rattlesnake behind it, but since I took a different way around it, the snake is facing the wrong way, and I am able to run off and avoid any possible bite.\n\nJust as with the paranormal experience, it is something that can't be proven through \"standardized\" methods, and exists only as an individual \"personal\" experience. \n\nAnd just as with the paranormal experience, opens the door with a desire to not only share my experiences with others, but to also compare what happened with others who also may have experienced similar events.\n\nI couldnt tell anyone exactly exsitence is or isn't.  All I know is what happened to me, and the greatest scientist's in the world can say anything against the possiblities---however, their words will never alter \"the experience\".\n\nThus, here I am, a registered member of Time Travel Institute.  That others may have experienced similar oddities, of that I am certain.  That others don't, and play around with making up stories, pretending they themselves had the similar experiences and are sharing fabricated tales--of that I am certain also, and becomes somewhat of a dissappontment when I run into these fabricators.\n\nJust as with the ghost hunters that take the time to research any claims of paranormal activity, and find that the related experiences are nothing but a hoax.  \n\nI never registered with any intentions of debunking anyone's claims, but come from a point-of-view of wanting to know---and if I grill somebody, it is to determine for myself if the tale is of a real experience or a fabricated tale from somebody that \"wishes\" they had such an experience.\n\nFictional forum, granted.  However, at least Time Travel Institute provides one way of sharing, and comparing, and at least trying to achieve something relative to the experiences.\n\nThat my friend WAS standing in my room is a fact.  How and why he was there ???\n\nThat \"something\" unusual seems to happen with time, is also a fact, How and why ??? \n\nWelcome to TTI !\n\nI don't know the answers to the mysteries of existence, if I did, I wouldn't be here, but be sitting somewhere smug with my vast pool of knowledge.\n\nOh well..don't know if this post was worth the time it took to write, nor was worth the posting, but decided to do it anyway.",
