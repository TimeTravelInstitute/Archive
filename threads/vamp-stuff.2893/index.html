<br />
The main reason real vampirism is not more widely believed is the failure of the general public to understand exactly what the virus which produces the condition actually is, or how it functions. Most people do not understand, or believe, that human DNA can be altered in such a way as to produce such a being. <br />
Actually, many things can alter a person's normal DNA. Drugs such as LSD and Thalidomide cause DNA changes and many viruses can change the DNA in a single gene. A combination of these altered genes can change the over all DNA of a living human.<br />
<br />
The term 'vampire' as used on this site as a medical term, must be separated from the vampire myths. A Viral Vampire is an infected human. Though the DNA in the host human has been greatly altered, the organism remains human in the medical sense as the number of chromosomes has not been changed. <br />
<br />
All humans, in fact the entire human race, have the same number of chromosomes. The number of chromosomes is what makes them human (except for those born with Down's Syndrome. These people have an extra chromosome but are, of course, human).<br />
    <br />
Technically the vampire is still a human, but for sake of discussion we think of viral vampires as non-human or as the next step up in human evolution. This is difficult to believe because many of the attributes of a vampire are, well, considered to be better and more developed than humans'. The strength, speed, enhanced mental and/or psychic abilities, the ability to digest human and other blood more efficiently are but a few of the differences. The reason this happens is the basic human DNA is altered by the virus. The virus, we call it V5 is NOT the same virus as HIV5. To simplify, it is transmitted through a simple infection. <br />
This infection is gained either through birth or infection from one who has the virus and passes it on. The child inherits the infection, passed on from the mother or father. The parent may have picked up the virus from some other member of their family such as a cousin, aunt, brother, etc., and thus the infection is passed on to the newborn child. Rarely are both parents infected, i.e., vampires themselves. More often, they are carriers of the virus, in a similar manner to the way a red haired child is born to a family who, for several generations, have been all blond. <br />
<br />
The passing of the virus to the child from the parent produces an Inheritor Vampire child. The V5 is passed on to the newborn much the same way the AIDS virus is passed from mother to child. In such a child, the virus remains dormant until the catalyst of the onset of puberty. The release of hormones is believed to activate the virus system.<br />
   <br />
The effects of the V5 virus then takes a number of years as the child develops to be completely effective, i.e., active in the system from its previously dormant state in the child's body. As in any infection, the child's immune system tries to fight off the infection, and in many cases, if not most, it succeeds. It is also believed that the blood chemical make up of the individual is also responsible in determining if the child will be fully affected by the virus and thus DNA altered. Not all infected people develop the vampire virus, V5, and thus not everyone born with it becomes a vampire. <br />
That is why we are not hip deep in real Inheritor vampires. The only other way to become a vampire is to be given the infection by someone already infected. This would make the person, the subject, a Classical. As with Inheritors, it takes Classicals quite a long time to develop the full blown virus once infected due to the same reasons; blood chemistry make up and the immune system. Also, not everyone who is exposed to the virus by a Classical will be a viable host for the virus. <br />
<br />
There is also a theory that a person has to be genetically predisposed to V5.<br />
 <br />
V5 is actually closely related to many other viruses such as the common flu virus and the AIDS virus. V5 is not the AIDS virus but works in much the same way as to infecting the host. Another reason the reality and cause of vampirism in today's modern world is not more widely believed is because not many members of the public or medical establishment know of the existence of V5. <br />
Why don't they know of it? Because, like Ebola and other new illnesses such as the Flesh Eating Bacteria, which actually have not been named so far, as we do not know what they are as of this date. V5 has only been known for a relatively short time, many years to be sure, but in regard to other illnesses, a short time.<br />
<br />
It has been many, many years now that several doctors in several parts of the USA and Europe have known about and been studying the V5 and its victims. The studies have been accomplished by long range, personal, one to one research with these infected people. <br />
<br />
Why so secretive? <br />
<br />
The same reason as with any other discovery. Once released, the doctors and researchers will gain money, fame and reputation. Not to mention grants, and the licensing of new drugs, etc. For the past few years, ImortalN and I have been telling people of the existence of the virus and explaining the ''what and why'' of this illness. We have compared it to other historical illnesses believed to be the cause of vampires in the past. <br />
<br />
A few years ago, it was discovered that V5 is related to the AIDS virus. We began telling people then of an impending break through in a vaccine for AIDS. A vaccine for AIDS, discovered from the link to the vampire virus. During the month of June 1998, both NBC and ABC first gave the announcement of a new AIDS vaccine. <br />
<br />
Just prior to that was released the news announcing a gene, newly discovered, that lengthened the life of a fruit fly by twice its normal life span. OK, laugh. It does sound funny, but it is most important. That gene, in an insect, was gained from gene mapping, isolating, and gene construction, and the same is possible and already being done with humans.<br />
    <br />
The V5 is accessed because of a special and rare gene some people have and which can be passed on through or by infection into a host. Next there will be further announcements of the life extension program already in effect for humans. Soon to follow, other announcements about gene splicing, genetic engineering and gene manipulation which had already been performed on lesser animals. <br />
The DNA of a jellyfish was implanted into a developing mouse embryo. The result? The unification of 2 non-related creatures which resulted in a litter of healthy mice, which actually glowed in the dark, the way a jellyfish glows in the darkness of the depths of the sea. This segment of research was shown on nation television on the science program Nova several times during the years of 1997 and 1998.<br />
<br />
Genetic mapping, and genetic coding of viruses will explain the V5 more fully to those not knowledgeable in medical or genetic terminology. Discovery of the V5 will make a huge difference when formally announced. <br />
<br />
Think for a moment what the full impact of such ramifications would mean.<br />
   <br />
What would happen to the nation's, to the world's, population if vampires were proven to be real? Real, but not at all like the myths or legends. <br />
First the fear. Vampires are stronger, faster, etc. They could easily take jobs. They tend to be smarter and more mentally adept, more psychic. Could they then dominate and control normal humans? <br />
<br />
The hatred. Humans cannot even live with their own kind in peace. How can they live with actual vampires? <br />
<br />
The envy, Vampires live longer, stay young looking longer. How many normal people would want to be able to do the same? <br />
<br />
Population. So many of them and they live longer. Less housing, less food and what else would they use longer than normal people? <br />
<br />
And what about the religious issues? The old church views are that all vampires are evil or in league with evil. How many righteous people would like to see them dead? How many hunters would like to see them dead? (See Real Hunters link elsewhere on this site) <br />
<br />
The government would want them for soldiers and laborers and so would other countries. Not to mention forcibly studying them like lab animals. <br />
<br />
What about the vampire himself/herself? Their safety gone, it is exposed, people who fear, hate or admire it, and all now know the vampire truly exists. <br />
<br />
How does society cope with something that it has been told for a millennium does not exist? <br />
<br />
How does the world establishment tell the populous of the existence of something believed to be myth and evil?<br />
    <br />
How do they integrate a newly identified species into the human community?<br />
    <br />
Very, very slowly and carefully.<br />
    <br />
To understand how DNA is altered by virus, we shall now look at normal genetic coding. Genetic code The ability to use more than one codon to specify a particular amino acid requires many different (mRNA) as many amino acids as there are triplets. The corresponding number of codon synonyms and (tRNA) results in the correspondence in (mRNA) transcription. The attraction between the (tRNA) and the triplets of the (mRNA) depends on the corresponding codon and the anticodon. The degeneration of the code has a pattern for all amino acids that have 2, 3, or 4 synonyms for the first 2 bases, one or more triplets. <br />
There may be a question as to where the triplets overlap.<br />
<br />
Example: a sequence of AUGGUGG Where a non overlapping code 2 amino acids, methioine (AUG) and prypothan (UGG) or could this really be 4 amino acids? Methioine (AUG), cysteiniel (UGU), valine (GUG), and tryptophaine (UGG)? Really bad problems can come from over lapping sequence AAU and AAC which may then read as AAUAAAC. This code could not be followed by methioine because the overlapping codon which resets UGA is a terminator codon. <br />
<br />
It was once believed that any one particular codon that specified an amino acid meant the same acid in all organisms. But it has been noted that there are exceptions in humans; to note these exceptions, go to the genetic code. Each (tRNA) molecule has 2 important functions. <br />
    <br />
1.To attach itself to a certain amino acid <br />
<br />
2.To place the acid in its proper place in the protein.<br />
    <br />
To do both jobs a sort of relocation site must exist in the (tRNA). The anticodon is the compliment of a certain messenger in the (mRNA). <br />
    <br />
Before you can understand what the vampire virus is and how it works, it is necessary to understand a bit of genetics and virus in general. <br />
Why? <br />
<br />
Because the vampire virus is closely related to, or you might say a cousin to, both the flu and the AIDS virus or to more properly say, related to the virus which goes on to cause HIV in humans. This statement simply means V5 is a retro-virus. The things which makes it so difficult to believe, and in fact is why most cannot believe in the existence of the vampire virus, is the lack of general understanding of how the v-virus can and does alter the human DNA to permit the vampire symptoms and maladies to take effect on the once human body. Most people do not believe the human DNA can be so drastically altered. <br />
<br />
This is a strange problem, since all retro viruses (except for perhaps some bacteria which are, of course, not viruses) and one form of RNA, viruses do most commonly change the cell DNA and take over the individual cell's original DNA. It commonly occurs in the flu virus and in the HIV virus, both of which are related to the V5 virus. <br />
<br />
To better understand how this virus works and how genetics plays a part in the inherited factors, we must first look at the basics of human genetic coding and regular and retro viruses.<br />
<br />
Those of you who have already had this in class, will see this is basic text book stuff found in any source for the study of genes or genetic coding. You have already read the above basics of genetic coding and how important the sequence of amino acids and bases are to the virus and its function in a cell.<br />
    <br />
Genetic coding is the means by which hereditary traits are passed from one human, or other species, on to another of its own kind in birth. Genetic code is the exact chemical equation by which the information making heredity is passed on from the genes to the proteins such as hemoglobin or pepsin. These and other proteins are the ladder which structures the human body. Enliens, pollypeptides, and hormones all serve to regulate these chemical reactions in the body. Chromosomes are located in the Nucleic Acids. <br />
The DNA or RNA of each Gene is responsible for making the Protein involved in the development of each trait. Species allow Genes to have the same effect on all its members in the same manner and so effect all its members from generation to generation of that species.<br />
<br />
The codon is the main unit. The Codon is involved with the structure of nucleic acid. Both DNA and RNA are composed of a special sequence of individual units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three smaller units, a phosphate, a slayer, and a base.<br />
    <br />
There are 4 types of Base in DNA. Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine are double rings called PURINES and the last component Thymine, is a single ring component called Pyrimidines in RNA. Uracilis is pyrimidine in RNA, wherever Thymine would be found in DNA. The key is the bases, and how they are arranged, and in which sequence in a chain of single strand of (rnRNA) or DNA. <br />
There are 20 different amino acids in proteins but only 4 bases. Nucleotide bases that is. This provides for 4x4x4 different and specific bases, 64 codons. There are more combinations actually but these are all we need to look at right now to realize the structure can be greatly varied as to acids and bases. With the exception of 3 of the 64 codons, each specifies one of the 20 amino acids in the proteins. <br />
<br />
Most acids have more than one codon but some have triplets as we have previously seen. The codons which specify are known as the synonyms for the amino acid. During the bonding the protein transfers to the genes the information. This occurs in 2 parts, transcription and translation. The transcription acts as the triplet on which the RNA pollynuecliotide chain, called the messenger RNA (mRNA). <br />
    <br />
The messenger carries the genetic code from the acids to the cell's nucleus, to the nucleus of the ribosomes in the cytoplasms of the cell. During the transcription (mRNA) is attached to the ribosomes which are sections of three actual proteins. (mRNA) CODON determines the sequence of amino acid in the protein. Synthesis each acid is connected to the ribosomes molecule of transcription. (tRNA) which has, in its nucleus, a sequence of three nucleotide bases. Contained in an anticodon, and is complementary to a particular codon in the (tRNA). An attraction hydrogen binding helps alter the RNA and (mRNA). During this bonding a particular amino acid is transferred to the polypeptide chain.<br />
Doctors originally thought that only one strand, the sense strand, of a double strand DNA contained the actual gene transcription into the RNA directly. The other strand, the antisense strand, was believed to function only as a replication. But this has now changed. It has since been learned that in some cases both strands are transcribed. This is considered a newer break through, something not known a number of years ago. Whichever antisense RNA is transcribed into protein or remains as RNA and may be a regulator to the sequence. <br />
<br />
This is believed but has not been officially established. <br />
<br />
In order for the Acid chain to be divided into sequence, each has to have a specific message signal showing the beginning and end of each sequence. (mRNA) contains a special codon at both ends of this message, one that initiates and one that ends the transcription of the Code. The triplet for the methioine (AUG) is the initiator codon for the protein synthesis. When first formed, polypeptide chains have methinomine as the first amino acid. <br />
<br />
During the transcription process or after the protein chain is completed some changes are usually made by the cellular entyines, and these form the foundation protein. One of these changes is sometimes the removal of methioine. There are 2 types of cells, eukarotic and prorkryotic. The difference is prorkryotic cells don't have a nucleus and rarely have a membrane. Both have DNA codons called nonsense codons such as UAA, UAG, or UGA ... carry anticodons and cannot be transcribed. (mRNA) codon is found in the messenger.<br />
    <br />
Virus    <br />
A virus is a living organism, a life form. <br />
It invades and takes over human cells. The virus invades a cell, kills it or changes the DNA of that cell and replaces the uninfected cells with replications of its own kind. As it replaces the normal cells or changes the DNA in the existing cell, it takes over the function of that cell. The body fights to kill or destroy these cells, if it fails the body can become ill and eventually die from this invasion, called an infection. <br />
<br />
There are 2 kinds of viruses, virus and retrovirus. A retrovirus stores genetic material as RNA instead of DNA in the cells. <br />
<br />
Remember that the flu is a virus which contains itself in a protein sphere, waiting for its release when you are more likely to be more confined in the winter months. In the summer although, the flu is also susceptible but one is more likely to be out in the open and less likely to be confined in an area. Thus, spread of this virus through coughing, nasal spray, and contact is more likely during the winter. <br />
<br />
In a retrovirus mainly the genetic material RNA is incorporated into the host cell. Then the virus takes over the function of the cell and in many cases changes or alters the DNA of the host cell while replicating itself. Each time the host cell divides it makes an exact and complete new copy of the new DNA along with its own genes. There are hundreds of viruses, the common flu is a virus as is HIV and LAV which are cousins to the v-virus but manufactures itself in much the same way.<br />
  <br />
HIV    <br />
Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus. <br />
A type of a virus that stores genetic information as RNA rather than as DNA. When the virus enters a targeted host cell, it releases its RNA and then makes DNA using the viral RNA as a pattern. The viral DNA then is incorporated into the host cell DNA. Each time a host cell divides, it also makes a new copy of the integrated viral DNA along with its own genes. The viral DNA can take over the functions of the cell, become activated, causing the cell to produce new virus particles. <br />
<br />
These new viruses are released from the infected cell to invade other cells. The DNA and RNA factor is the difference between the retrovirus and virus. The vampire virus works in much the same way but does not go on to destroy the immune system. Instead it is coded to replace regular genetic material and alter it in such a way as to cause physical changes in the actual function of several aspects of the human body such as in digestion, slower aging, increased physical strength, mental capacity, etc. <br />
<br />
The Genetic Code has certain characteristics which determine how and under what conditions coding is to be read. The sequence of a nucleotide base is to be read in certain sequences which show the determination of the formations of the cell. Most amino acids in proteins- and there are over 20 of them- have at least 2 codons, however some have as many as 6. <br />
<br />
In a situation in which 2 or more codon words have the same meaning is called a degenerative code. The ability to use more than one codon to specify a particular amino acid requires many different (tRNA) as many amino acids as there are triplets. The correspondents of the number of codons synonyms and (tRNA) results in the correspondence in (mRNA ) transcription. The attraction between the (tRNA) and the triplets of the (mRNA) depends on the correspondents codon and the anticodon. The degeneration of the code has a pattern for all amino acids that have 2, 3, or 4 synonyms for the first 2 bases one or more triplets.<br />
    <br />
In Summary<br />
    <br />
Genetic coding is the means by which heredity is passed from one human species to another member of that species or any Species in fact. Genetic code is the exact chemical equation by which the information making heredity is passed on from the genes to the proteins such as hemoglobin or pepsin. <br />
These and other proteins are the ladder which structures the human body. Enliens and pollypeptides, hormones, regulate these chemical reactions in the body. To understand more of how V5 acts to change the human cell structure in the human body we need to remember just how HIV works on the body. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus, a type of virus that stores genetic information as RNA rather than as DNA. When the virus enters a targeted host cell, it releases its RNA and then makes DNA using the viral RNA as a pattern. The viral DNA then is incorporated into the host cell DNA. <br />
<br />
Each time a host cell divides, it also makes a new copy of the integrated viral DNA along with its own genes. The viral DNA can take over the functions of the cell, become activated, causing the cell to produce new virus particles. These new viruses are released from the infected cell to invade other cells. The DNA and RNA factor is the difference between the retrovirus and virus. In a similar manner does V5 also slowly take over the function of the cells while replicating itself. Definition: similarly affect the cell DNA of the infected vampire.<br />
    <br />
The medical and scientific community will make slowly released announcements in approximately the following order. Release to the general public announcements which have already been made on the TV show nova regarding gene mapping, gene splicing. <br />
Then the release of a newly discovered or mapped gene found to prolong life, a prelude to this announcement was just accomplished on NBC and ABC recent television broadcasts. <br />
<br />
Next announcements on a human life extension program, which it has already done but taking another direction as can be found in the site links elsewhere on the main page of this site. The announcement of a vaccine- not a cure- but a prevention of AIDS, which was released on NBC and ABC in June 1998. <br />
<br />
Next shall come the announcement of the newly discovered virus which in itself lead to the Aids / HIV Vaccine. And then the announcement of the V5 virus itself. Then finally how V5 lead to the break through for HIV cure and then how the research was actually conducted. Finally telling the world about those people the research was conducted upon. Those actual, living, genuine vampires. <br />
<br />
To get the proof you all seek so desperately all you need do is wait for this time line to play itself out. Its that simple. <br />
<br />
How long will all this take? I do not know. <br />
<br />
The prediction is three to six years as the time line goes. <br />
<br />
Not long to wait really.<br />
    <br />
Now how does all this relate to the prophecies?<br />
<br />
(SEE PROPHECIES LINK ELSEWHERE ON THIS SITE)<br />
    <br />
As you read over the prophecies, think of what happens if the vampires do not want this information getting out. Suppose there is a differing of opinion in the overall world wide vampire communities; for the sake of discussion lets say 50 percent of the vampire population felt this information should not be released as the end result would inevitably lead to a vaccine for V5 as well as Aids. If this occurred what could it mean to the vampiric world? <br />
The vaccine I speak of is NOT the HIV vaccine, or the segment known as HIV5, but could be produced as a derivative of the same.<br />
    <br />
1. A vaccine, used as part of an Aids preventive, will one day be given to all children under the age of five probably included in their normal childhood shots. <br />
    <br />
These human children grow into adults and some will become volunteers for vampire feeding. <br />
The vampires who feed upon this blood ingest the antibodies for the V5 as well since V5 was used in its manufacture. Or that there is also simply a vaccine for V5 given to all children to prevent their being infected once it is believed and understood that real and actual vampires exist. Now the vampire ingests this medically treated blood and the antibodies in the volunteers blood begins to activate on the vampire. If his/her DNA is altogether changed, it is only the virus taking over the cell functions which is keeping it alive. <br />
<br />
To destroy that virus at this stage, or for the vaccine to affect the vampire DNA at a later date, could mean killing the V5, hence killing the host, death to the vampire itself. <br />
<br />
With the general population so vaccinated there is much less of a food source for the vampire and competition for the remaining available unvaccinated humans becomes fierce.<br />
    <br />
2. The information about the vampire can also lead to hunters making weapons to kill the vampire more easily and efficiently. Why then would a vampire want this information to go to the general public? <br />
    <br />
Without a cure for AIDS, in very little relative time many, many millions of humans will die, disturbing the balance of nature. Both their own relation to the environment and the human balance relation to the vampire. <br />
Many vampires feel this natural balance should not be altered, It is a prevailing belief that humans must be saved to preserve the natural balance and order of the planet and therefore it is most necessary to help cure AIDS. <br />
<br />
Many vampires feel it is inevitable that humans will one day find the vampire virus and thus a vaccine for it. It is the hope of the vampires that human kind can be taught to coexist and in so doing may find a way to help the vampire survive. <br />
<br />
On one hand we have those who wish no knowledge given out. Let the humans die of AIDS or anything else, it is natural selection. Then there are the others. 'NO! we must preserve the natural balance at all costs.' <br />
<br />
Now reread the prophecies, perhaps they will now make more sense to you. The truth is vampires are indeed real, they are a product of an ages old inherited virus which alters DNA and creates the differences. These kinds and type of genetically caused illnesses are well known today and new viruses are being discovered all the time. <br />
 <br />
V5 is an ancient illness only now coming into the light of modern day. Its form and reasons are simple and easily understood by anyone with an open mind and willingness to wait for the medical proof to be announced. It will indeed be made known and no doubt disputed at first. <br />
    <br />
But, in the end, the vampire will be nearly as common as the human. <br />
    <br />
The new question then being, if the human cannot live peaceably with its own kind how can there be the needed balance between the human and vampire? <br />
    <br />
And will either species allow the other to exist at all? <br />
    <br />
Please note: V5 is not the actual name of the virus which causes the Vampiric condition and changed DNA. It is a name we give to it. <br />
Why? <br />
<br />
So hunters and others will not know where to actually look in the records should they find them before the Vampiric Communities are ready. <br />
    <br />
As ever,<br />

The main reason real vampirism is not more widely believed is the failure of the general public to understand exactly what the virus which produces the condition actually is, or how it functions. Most people do not understand - or believe - that human DNA can be altered in such a way as to produce such a being. Actually, many things can alter a person's normal DNA. Drugs such as LSD and Thalidomide cause DNA changes and many viri (plural form of virus) can change the DNA in a single gene. A combination of these altered genes can change the overall DNA of a living human.<br />
The term vampire - used as a medical term - must be separated from the vampire myths; a Viral Vampire is an infected human. Though the DNA in the host human has been greatly altered, the organism remains human in the medical sense as the number of chromosomes has not been changed. All humans - in fact the entire human race - has the same number of chromosomes; the number of chromosomes is what makes them human. Technically the vampire is still a human, but for sake of discussion we think of viral vampires as non-human or as the next step up in human evolution. This is difficult to believe because many of the attributes of a vampire are considered to be better and more developed than humans. The strength, speed, enhanced mental and/or psychic abilities, the ability to digest human and other blood more efficiently are but a few of the differences. <br />
<br />
The reason this happens is the basic human DNA is altered by the virus. The virus - we call it V5 - is NOT the same virus as HIV5. To simplify, it is transmitted through a simple infection. This infection is gained either through birth or infection from one who has the virus and passes it on. The child inherits the infection, passed on from the mother or father. The parent may have picked up the virus from some other member of their family such as a cousin, aunt, brother, etc. and thus the infection is passed on to the new born child. Rarely are both parents infected, i.e. vampires themselves. More often, they are carriers of the virus, in a similar manner to the way a red haired child is born to a family who, for several generation, have been all blond. The passing of the virus to the child from the parent produces an Inheritor Vampire1 child. The V5 is passed on to the newborn much the same way the AIDS virus is passed from mother to child. In such a child, the virus remains dormant until the catalyst of the onset of puberty. The release of hormones is believed to activate the virus system. <br />
<br />
The effects of the V5 virus then takes a number of years as the child develops to be completely effective, i.e. active in the system from its previously dormant state in the child's body. As in any infection, the child's immune system tries to fight off the infection and in many cases - if not most - it succeeds. It is also believed that the blood chemical make up of the individual is also responsible in determining if the child will be fully affected by the virus and thus DNA altered. Not all infected people develop the vampire virus and thus not everyone born with it becomes a vampire. That is why we are not hip deep in real Inheritor vampires. The only other way to become a vampire is to be given the infection by someone already infected. This would make the person, the subject, a Classical Vampire2. As with Inheritors, it takes Classicals quite a long time to develop the full blown virus once infected due to the same reasons; blood chemistry make up and the immune system. Also, not all Classicals develop the virus. There is also a theory that a person has to be genetically predisposed to V5. V5 is actually closely related to many other viri such as the common flu virus and the AIDS virus. V5 is not the AIDS virus but works in much the same way as to infecting the host. Another reason the reality and cause of vampirism in today's modern world is not more widely believed is because not many members of the public or medical establishment know of the existence of V5. Why don't they know of it? Because, like Ebola and other new illnesses such as the Flesh Eating Bacteria - which actually have not been named so far - we do not know what they are as of this date. V5 has only been known for a relatively short time, many years to be sure, but in regard to other illnesses, a short time.<br />
<br />
It has been many, many years now that several doctors in several parts of the USA and Europe have known about and been studying the V5 and its victims. The studies have been accomplished by long range, personal, one to one research with these infected people. Why so secretive? The same reason as with any other discovery. Once released, the doctors and researchers will gain money, fame and reputation. Not to mention grants, and the licensing of new drugs, etc. For the past few years, ImortalN and I have been telling people of the existence of the virus and explaining the what and why of this illness. We have compared it to other historical illnesses believed to be the cause of vampires in the past. <br />
<br />
A few years ago, it was discovered that V5 is related to the AIDS virus. We began telling people then of an impending break through in a vaccine for AIDS. A vaccine for AIDS, discovered from the link to the vampire virus. During the month of June 1998, both NBC and ABC first gave the announcement of a new AIDS vaccine. Just prior to that was released the news announcing a gene, newly discovered, that lengthened the life of a fruit fly by twice its normal life span. OK, laugh. It does sound funny, but it is most important. That gene, in an insect, was gained from gene mapping, isolating, and gene construction, and the same is possible and already being done with humans.<br />
<br />
The V5 is accessed because of a special and rare gene some people have and which can be passed on through or by infection into a host. Next there will be further announcements of the life extension program already in effect for humans. Soon to follow, other announcements about gene splicing, genetic engineering and gene manipulation which had already been performed on lesser animals.<br />
<br />
Genetic mapping, and genetic coding of viri will explain the V5 more fully to those not knowledgeable in medical or genetic terminology. Discovery of the V5 will make a huge difference when formally announced. Think for a moment what the full impact of such ramifications would mean...</div>

The 'real' cure for Aids is being held back. I doubt it will ever be released now.<br />
<br />
Also creed is correct, aids if this continues will wipe out a massive protion of worldwide population. The backfire is, that alot of this will be from MEDC's rather then localised to LEDC's and groups that are 'considered' to be expendable. Which obviously is delusion, as no one person is more expendable than another, regardless.<br />

CHAPTER I<br />
THE ORIGINS OF THE VAMPIRE<br />
THROUGHOUT the whole vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figure so terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nor demon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysterious and terrible qualities of both. Around the vampire have clustered the most sombre superstitions, for he is a thing which belongs to no world at all; he is not a demon, for the devils have a purely spiritual nature, they are beings without any body, angels, as is said in S. Matthew xxv. 41, &quot;the devil and his angels.&quot;[1] And although S. Gregory writes of the word Angel, &quot;nomen est officii, non naturae,&quot;--the designation is that of an office not of a nature, it is clear that all angels were in the beginning created good in order to act as the divine messengers ({Greek a?'ggeloi}), and that afterwards the fallen angels lapsed from their original state. The authoritative teaching of the Fourth Lateran Council under Innocent III in 1215, dogmatically lays down: &quot;Diabolus enim et alii daemones a Deo quidem natura creati sunt boni, sed ipsi per se facti sunt mali.&quot; And it is also said, Job iv. 18: &quot;Ecce qui seruiunt ei, non sunt stabiles, et in Angelis suis reperit prauitatem.&quot; (Behold they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness.)<br />
<br />
John Heinrich Zopfius in his Dissertatio de Uampiris Seruiensibus, Halle, 1733, says: &quot;Vampires issue forth from their graves in the night, attack people sleeping quietly in their beds, suck out all their blood from their bodies and destroy them. They beset men, women and children alike, sparing neither age nor sex. Those who are under the fatal malignity of their influence complain of suffocation and a total deficiency of spirits, after which they soon expire. Some<br />
<br />
{p. 2 }<br />
<br />
who, when at the point of death, have been asked if they can tell what is causing their decease, reply that such and such persons, lately dead, have arisen from the tomb to torment and torture them.&quot; Scoffern in his Stray Leaves of Science and Folk Lore writes: &quot;The best definition I can give of a vampire is a living, mischievous and murderous dead body. A living dead body! The words are idle, contradictory, incomprehensible, but so are Vampires.&quot; Horst, Schriften und Hypothesen Ã¼ber die Vampyren, (Zauberbibliothek, III) defines a Vampire as &quot;a dead body which continues to live in the grave; which it leaves, however, by night, for the purpose of sucking the blood of the living, whereby it is nourished and preserved in good condition, instead of becoming decomposed like other dead bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
A demon has no body, although for purposes of his own he may energize, assume, or seem to assume a body, but it is not his real and proper body.[2] So the vampire is not strictly a demon, although his foul lust and horrid propensities be truly demoniacal and of hell.<br />
<br />
Neither may the vampire be called a ghost or phantom, strictly speaking, for an apparition is intangible, as the Latin poet tells us:<br />
<br />
Par leuibus uentis uolucrique simillima somno.[3]<br />
<br />
And upon that first Easter night when Jesus stood in the midst of His disciples and they were troubled and frightened, supposing they had seen a spirit, He said: &quot;Uidete manus meas, et pedes, quia ego ipse sum: palpate, et uidete: quia spiritus carnem, et ossa non habet, sicut ne uidetis habere.&quot; (See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bone, as you see me to have.)[4]<br />
<br />
There are, it is true, upon record some few instances when persons have been able to grasp, or have been grasped by and felt the touch of, a ghost, but these phenomena must be admitted as exceptions altogether, if indeed, they are not to be explained in some other way, as for example, owing to the information of a body by some spirit or familiar under very rare and abnormal conditions.<br />
<br />
In the case of the very extraordinary and horrible hauntings of the old Darlington and Stockton Station, Mr. James Durham, the night-watchman, when one winter evening in the porter's cellar was surprised by the entry of a stranger<br />
<br />
{p. 3}<br />
<br />
followed by a large black retriever. This visitor without uttering a word dealt him a blow and he had the impression of a violent concussion. Naturally he struck back with his fist which seemed however to pass through the figure and his knuckles were grazed against the wall beyond. None the less the man uttered an unearthly squeak at which the dog gripped Mr. Durham in the calf of the leg causing considerable pain. In a moment the stranger had called off the retriever by a curious click of the tongue, and both man and animal hurried into the coal-house whence there was no outlet. A moment later upon examination neither was to be seen. It was afterwards discovered that many years before an official who was invariably accompanied by a large black dog had committed suicide upon the premises, if not in the very cellar, where at least his dead body had been laid. The full account with the formal attestation dated 9th December, 1890, may be read in W. T. Stead's Real Ghost Stories, reprint, Grant Richards, 1897, Chapter XI, pp. 210-214.<br />
<br />
Major C. G. MacGregor of Donaghadee, County Down, Ireland, gives an account of a house in the north of Scotland which was haunted by an old lady, who resided there for very many years and died shortly after the beginning of the nineteenth century. Several persons who slept in the room were sensibly pushed and even smartly slapped upon the face. He himself on feeling a blow upon the left shoulder in the middle of the night turned quickly and reaching out grasped a human hand, warm, soft, and plump. Holding it tight he felt the wrist and arm which appeared clothed in a sleeve and lace cuff. At the elbow all trace ceased, and in his astonishment he released the hand. When a light was struck nobody could be seen in the room.<br />
<br />
In a case which occurred at a cottage in Girvan, South Ayrshire, a young woman lost her brother, a fisher, owing to the swamping of his boat in a storm, When the body was recovered it was found that the right hand was missing. This occasioned the poor girl extraordinary sorrow, but some few nights later when she was undressing, preparatory to bed, she suddenly uttered a piercing shriek which immediately brought the other inmates of the house to her room. She declared that she had felt a violent blow dealt with an open hand upon her shoulder. The place was examined,<br />
<br />
{p. 4}<br />
<br />
and distinctly marked in livid bruises there was seen the impression of a man's right hand.<br />
<br />
Andrew Lang in his Dreams and Ghosts (new edition, 1897), relates the story of &quot;The Ghost that Bit,&quot; which might seem to have been a vampire, but which actually cannot be so classed since vampires have a body and their craving for blood is to obtain sustenance for their body. The narrative is originally to be found in Notes and Queries, 3rd September 1864, and the correspondent asserts that he took it &quot;almost verbatim from the lips of the lady&quot; concerned, a person of tried veracity. Emma S------ was asleep one morning in her room at a large house near Cannock Chase. It was a fine August day in 1840, but although she had bidden her maid call her at an early hour she was surprised to hear a sharp knocking upon her door about 3.30. In spite of her answer the taps continued, and suddenly the curtains of her bed were slightly drawn, when to her amaze she saw the face of an aunt by marriage looking through upon her. Half unconsciously she threw out her hand, and immediately one of her thumbs was sensibly premed by the teeth of the apparition. Forthwith she arose, dressed, and went downstairs, where not a creature was stirring. Her father upon coming down rallied her a little upon being about at cockcrow and inquired the cause. When she informed him he determined that later in the day he would pay a visit to his sister-in-law who dwelt at no great distance. This he did, only to discover that she had unexpectedly died at about 3.30 that morning. She had not been in any way ailing, and the shook was fearfully sudden. On one of the thumbs of the corpse was found a mark as if it had been bitten in the last agony.<br />
<br />
The disturbances at the Lamb hostelry, Lawford's Gate, Bristol, which aroused something more than local interest in the years 1761-62, were not improbably due to witchcraft and caused by the persecutions of a woman who trafficked in occultism of the lowest order, although on the other hand they may have been poltergeist manifestations. The two little girls, Molly and Debby Giles, who were the subjects of these phenomena, were often severely bitten and pinched. The impressions of eighteen or twenty teeth were seen upon their arms, the marks being clammy with saliva and warm spittle, &quot;and the children were roaring out for the pain of the<br />
<br />
{p. 5}<br />
<br />
pinches and bites.&quot; On one occasion whilst an observer was talking to Dobby Giles she cried out that she was bitten in the neck when there suddenly appeared &quot;the mark of teeth, about eighteen, and wet with spittle.&quot; That the child should have nipped herself was wholly impossible, and nobody was near her save Mr. Henry Durbin who recorded these events, and whose account was first printed in 1800, the year after his death, since he did not wish his notes to be given to the public during his lifetime. On 2nd January, 1762, Mr. Durbin notes: &quot;Dobby cried the hand was about her sister's throat, and I saw the flesh at the side of her throat pushed in, whitish as if done with fingers, though I saw none. Her face grew red and blackish presently, as if she was strangled, but without any convulsion or contraction of the muscles.&quot; Thursday, 7th January, 1762, we have: &quot;Dobby was bitten most and with deeper impressions than Molly. The impression of the teeth on their arms formed an oval, which measured two inches in length.&quot; All this certainly looks as if sorcery were at work. It may be remembered that in Salem during the epidemic of witchcraft the afflicted persons were tormented &quot;by Biting, Pinching, Strangling, etc.&quot; When Goodwife Corey was on trial, &quot;it was observed several times, that if she did but bite her under lip in time of examination, the Persons afflicted were bitten on their arms and Wrists, and produced the Marks before the Magistrates, Minister, and others.&quot;<br />
<br />
In The Proceedings of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, Vol. I., 1927, will be found an account of the phenomena connected with Eleonore ZÃ¼gun, a young Rumanian peasant girl, who in the autumn of 1926, when only thirteen years old was brought to London by the Countess Wassilko-Serecki, in order that the manifestations might be investigated at &quot;The National Laboratory of Psychical Research,&quot; Queensberry Place, South Kensington. The child was said to be persecuted by some invisible force or agent, which she knew as Dracu, Anglice the Devil. There were many extraordinary happenings and she was continually being scratched and bitten by this unseen intelligence. It must suffice to give but two or three instances of the very many &quot;biting phenomena.&quot; On the afternoon of Monday, 4th October, 1926, Captain Neil Gow an investigator in his report, notes:<br />
<br />
{p. 6}<br />
<br />
&quot;3.20. Eleonore cried out. Showed marks on back of left hand like teeth-marks which afterwards developed into deep weals. . . . 4.12. Eleonore was just raising a cup of tea to her lips, but suddently {sic} gave a cry and put the cup down hastily: there was a mark on her right hand similar to that caused by a bite. Both rows of teeth were indicated.&quot; Of the same incident, Mr. Clapham Palmer, an investigator who was also present writes: &quot;Eleonore was in the act of raising the cup to her lips when she suddenly gave a little cry of pain, put down her cup and rolled up her sleeve. On her forearm I then saw what appeared to be the marks of teeth indented deeply in the flesh, as if she or someone had fiercely bitten her arm. The marks turned from red to white and finally took the form of white raised weals. They gradually faded but were still noticeable after an hour or so.&quot; Such bitings not infrequent occurred, and photographs have been taken of the marks.<br />
<br />
It were an interesting question to discuss the cause of these indentations and no doubt it is sufficiently remarkable, but however that may be such inquiry were impertinent here, for it is clearly not vampirism, nor indeed cognate thereto. The object of the Vampire is to suck blood, and in these cases if blood was ever drawn it was more in the nature of a scratch or slight dental puncture, there was no effusion. Again the agent who inflicted these bites was not sufficiently material to be visible, at any rate he was able to remain unseen. The true vampire is corporeal.<br />
<br />
The vampire has a body, and it is his own body. He is neither dead nor alive; but living in death. He is an abnormality; the androgyne in the phantom world; a pariah among the fiends.<br />
<br />
Even the Pagan poet taught his hearers and his readers that death was a sweet guerdon of repose, a blessed oblivion after the toil and struggle of life. There are few things more beautiful and there are few things more sad than the songs of our modern Pagans who console their aching hearts with the wistful vision of eternal sleep. Although perhaps they themselves know it not, their delicate but despairing melancholy is an heritage from the weary yet tuneful singers of the last days of Hellas, souls for whom there was no dawn of hope in the sky. But we have a certain knowledge and a fairer surety</div>

 Assamites <br />
Vampires are the killers in the night, and none moreso than the Assamites, slayers of both Kindred and kine. Called in regularly by the world's Justicars as archons and by princes as assassins, no clan is more feared by the Kindred. Secretive and taciturn, Assamites will travel anywhere in search of their targets, accepting as payment the blood of their employers. <br />
While Assamites spend much of their time in the same solitary pursuits as other Kindred, they are best known for their skills as hired killers. In exchange for using their unique talents against the enemies of princes and anarchs alike, Assamites demand a portion of their employers' vitae They do not accept every petition for aid, but once they have accepted a &quot;contract,&quot; they consider themselves honor bound to carry out the exact word of the agreement. <br />
<br />
The clan was founded more than a millennium ago in the hinterlands of the Turkish mountains, and has always fiercely protected its privacy. Assamites are fundamentalists of a bizarre brand, practicing a faith that is a mixture of many Middle Eastern religions and Kindred mythology. They believe that the only way for vampires to reach heaven is to become closer to Caine - and the only means of doing this is to lower one's generation. <br />
<br />
For much of the clan's early history the Assamites engaged in diablerie, seeking always to bring themselves closer to &quot;the One.&quot; They became the most feared killers among the Kindred. Assamite leg end claims the clan founder slew two of the second-generation Cainites by his own hand. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for the clan, it is no longer possible for Assamites to engage in diablerie. During the late Middle Ages (during the period of the &quot;Sabbat uprising&quot;), the Assamites found it easy to hunt their prey. So many elders were killed that the Camarilla declared a Blood Hunt against the entire Assamite clan. After a period of seven years, Alamut, the clan's ancient fortress sanctuary, was close to being discovered. For the first time in its history the clan sued for peace, and negotiated a complicated treaty.  (This curse has since been broken in 1998, and he Assamites have returned to their tradition of hunting for the purposes of diablerie.) <br />
<br />
The Assamites agreed never again to hunt other Kindred for their blood and, in exchange, the Blood Hunt against them was called off. The clan was forced to allow the Tremere Council of Seven to cast a great ritual upon all its members. This ritual made it impossible for Assamites to drink the blood of other Kindred (see Weaknesses, below). <br />
<br />
However, the Assamites managed to adapt some of the most ancient rites of their clan into an approximation of diablerie. The blood they take as pay from those who hire them is collected and then used in a ritual of creation. When the clan holds its five-year gatherings at Alamut, its members are able to brew</div>

<br />
Look yo,<br />
<br />
      Have you ever heard of a chemical imbalance?<br />
When not &quot;treated,&quot; the person will develop super-human strength, enhanced senses (psychic abillities being a sense, would probally explain physical time travel,) especially when in a psychotic state of mind. I should know, I have one. A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE is evolution in my eyes, but I'm not a &quot;vampire.&quot;<br />
The origin of the word vampire comes from this exact study you speak of... the government can travel through time, but only for their benefit, not the benefit of the people. (STICK WITH ME, YOU'RE GONNA LEARN SOMETHIN') They did just that... took the word from medical researchers and brought it to us in the time of Dracul and Vlad. Raiding our castle, they took over and imprisoned us in our own home. I was only a child so I didn't completely understand what was happening at the time. They fed my father excessive amounts of LSD and tortured his mind with evil,*For example: telling us we were &quot;vampires&quot;* (This is where you get these myths of vampires being evil) cause believe it or not, the government is evil... this is proof. They tried to turn him against his family, but he stayed strong and for that I am proud of him. After a long time of torture and failed attempts to alter his will, Vlad fought back to free us. This battle continues to this very day.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a war from the depth of time.&quot; ~Zach de La Rocha<br />
<br />
               &quot;Vampire&quot;<br />
<br />
A word of my pain and suffering<br />
but it is not me,<br />
To manifest my torment<br />
To encourage my hatred<br />
but it is not me<br />
<br />
&quot;You are as wretched as Christopher Columbus,<br />
and I am not your entertainment.&quot;<br />

			"headline": "vamp stuff",
			"articleBody": "http:\/\/www.geocities.com\/vampiricstudies\/medical.html\n\nThe main reason real vampirism is not more widely believed is the failure of the general public to understand exactly what the virus which produces the condition actually is, or how it functions. Most people do not understand, or believe, that human DNA can be altered in such a way as to produce such a being. \nActually, many things can alter a person's normal DNA. Drugs such as LSD and Thalidomide cause DNA changes and many viruses can change the DNA in a single gene. A combination of these altered genes can change the over all DNA of a living human.\n\nThe term 'vampire' as used on this site as a medical term, must be separated from the vampire myths. A Viral Vampire is an infected human. Though the DNA in the host human has been greatly altered, the organism remains human in the medical sense as the number of chromosomes has not been changed. \n\nAll humans, in fact the entire human race, have the same number of chromosomes. The number of chromosomes is what makes them human (except for those born with Down's Syndrome. These people have an extra chromosome but are, of course, human).\n    \nTechnically the vampire is still a human, but for sake of discussion we think of viral vampires as non-human or as the next step up in human evolution. This is difficult to believe because many of the attributes of a vampire are, well, considered to be better and more developed than humans'. The strength, speed, enhanced mental and\/or psychic abilities, the ability to digest human and other blood more efficiently are but a few of the differences. The reason this happens is the basic human DNA is altered by the virus. The virus, we call it V5 is NOT the same virus as HIV5. To simplify, it is transmitted through a simple infection. \nThis infection is gained either through birth or infection from one who has the virus and passes it on. The child inherits the infection, passed on from the mother or father. The parent may have picked up the virus from some other member of their family such as a cousin, aunt, brother, etc., and thus the infection is passed on to the newborn child. Rarely are both parents infected, i.e., vampires themselves. More often, they are carriers of the virus, in a similar manner to the way a red haired child is born to a family who, for several generations, have been all blond. \n\nThe passing of the virus to the child from the parent produces an Inheritor Vampire child. The V5 is passed on to the newborn much the same way the AIDS virus is passed from mother to child. In such a child, the virus remains dormant until the catalyst of the onset of puberty. The release of hormones is believed to activate the virus system.\n   \nThe effects of the V5 virus then takes a number of years as the child develops to be completely effective, i.e., active in the system from its previously dormant state in the child's body. As in any infection, the child's immune system tries to fight off the infection, and in many cases, if not most, it succeeds. It is also believed that the blood chemical make up of the individual is also responsible in determining if the child will be fully affected by the virus and thus DNA altered. Not all infected people develop the vampire virus, V5, and thus not everyone born with it becomes a vampire. \nThat is why we are not hip deep in real Inheritor vampires. The only other way to become a vampire is to be given the infection by someone already infected. This would make the person, the subject, a Classical. As with Inheritors, it takes Classicals quite a long time to develop the full blown virus once infected due to the same reasons; blood chemistry make up and the immune system. Also, not everyone who is exposed to the virus by a Classical will be a viable host for the virus. \n\nThere is also a theory that a person has to be genetically predisposed to V5.\n \nV5 is actually closely related to many other viruses such as the common flu virus and the AIDS virus. V5 is not the AIDS virus but works in much the same way as to infecting the host. Another reason the reality and cause of vampirism in today's modern world is not more widely believed is because not many members of the public or medical establishment know of the existence of V5. \nWhy don't they know of it? Because, like Ebola and other new illnesses such as the Flesh Eating Bacteria, which actually have not been named so far, as we do not know what they are as of this date. V5 has only been known for a relatively short time, many years to be sure, but in regard to other illnesses, a short time.\n\nIt has been many, many years now that several doctors in several parts of the USA and Europe have known about and been studying the V5 and its victims. The studies have been accomplished by long range, personal, one to one research with these infected people. \n\nWhy so secretive? \n\nThe same reason as with any other discovery. Once released, the doctors and researchers will gain money, fame and reputation. Not to mention grants, and the licensing of new drugs, etc. For the past few years, ImortalN and I have been telling people of the existence of the virus and explaining the ''what and why'' of this illness. We have compared it to other historical illnesses believed to be the cause of vampires in the past. \n\nA few years ago, it was discovered that V5 is related to the AIDS virus. We began telling people then of an impending break through in a vaccine for AIDS. A vaccine for AIDS, discovered from the link to the vampire virus. During the month of June 1998, both NBC and ABC first gave the announcement of a new AIDS vaccine. \n\nJust prior to that was released the news announcing a gene, newly discovered, that lengthened the life of a fruit fly by twice its normal life span. OK, laugh. It does sound funny, but it is most important. That gene, in an insect, was gained from gene mapping, isolating, and gene construction, and the same is possible and already being done with humans.\n    \nThe V5 is accessed because of a special and rare gene some people have and which can be passed on through or by infection into a host. Next there will be further announcements of the life extension program already in effect for humans. Soon to follow, other announcements about gene splicing, genetic engineering and gene manipulation which had already been performed on lesser animals. \nThe DNA of a jellyfish was implanted into a developing mouse embryo. The result? The unification of 2 non-related creatures which resulted in a litter of healthy mice, which actually glowed in the dark, the way a jellyfish glows in the darkness of the depths of the sea. This segment of research was shown on nation television on the science program Nova several times during the years of 1997 and 1998.\n\nGenetic mapping, and genetic coding of viruses will explain the V5 more fully to those not knowledgeable in medical or genetic terminology. Discovery of the V5 will make a huge difference when formally announced. \n\nThink for a moment what the full impact of such ramifications would mean.\n   \nWhat would happen to the nation's, to the world's, population if vampires were proven to be real? Real, but not at all like the myths or legends. \nFirst the fear. Vampires are stronger, faster, etc. They could easily take jobs. They tend to be smarter and more mentally adept, more psychic. Could they then dominate and control normal humans? \n\nThe hatred. Humans cannot even live with their own kind in peace. How can they live with actual vampires? \n\nThe envy, Vampires live longer, stay young looking longer. How many normal people would want to be able to do the same? \n\nPopulation. So many of them and they live longer. Less housing, less food and what else would they use longer than normal people? \n\nAnd what about the religious issues? The old church views are that all vampires are evil or in league with evil. How many righteous people would like to see them dead? How many hunters would like to see them dead? (See Real Hunters link elsewhere on this site) \n\nThe government would want them for soldiers and laborers and so would other countries. Not to mention forcibly studying them like lab animals. \n\nWhat about the vampire himself\/herself? Their safety gone, it is exposed, people who fear, hate or admire it, and all now know the vampire truly exists. \n\nHow does society cope with something that it has been told for a millennium does not exist? \n\nHow does the world establishment tell the populous of the existence of something believed to be myth and evil?\n    \nHow do they integrate a newly identified species into the human community?\n    \nVery, very slowly and carefully.\n    \nTo understand how DNA is altered by virus, we shall now look at normal genetic coding. Genetic code The ability to use more than one codon to specify a particular amino acid requires many different (mRNA) as many amino acids as there are triplets. The corresponding number of codon synonyms and (tRNA) results in the correspondence in (mRNA) transcription. The attraction between the (tRNA) and the triplets of the (mRNA) depends on the corresponding codon and the anticodon. The degeneration of the code has a pattern for all amino acids that have 2, 3, or 4 synonyms for the first 2 bases, one or more triplets. \nThere may be a question as to where the triplets overlap.\n\nExample: a sequence of AUGGUGG Where a non overlapping code 2 amino acids, methioine (AUG) and prypothan (UGG) or could this really be 4 amino acids? Methioine (AUG), cysteiniel (UGU), valine (GUG), and tryptophaine (UGG)? Really bad problems can come from over lapping sequence AAU and AAC which may then read as AAUAAAC. This code could not be followed by methioine because the overlapping codon which resets UGA is a terminator codon. \n\nIt was once believed that any one particular codon that specified an amino acid meant the same acid in all organisms. But it has been noted that there are exceptions in humans; to note these exceptions, go to the genetic code. Each (tRNA) molecule has 2 important functions. \n    \n1.To attach itself to a certain amino acid \n\n2.To place the acid in its proper place in the protein.\n    \nTo do both jobs a sort of relocation site must exist in the (tRNA). The anticodon is the compliment of a certain messenger in the (mRNA). \n    \nBefore you can understand what the vampire virus is and how it works, it is necessary to understand a bit of genetics and virus in general. \nWhy? \n\nBecause the vampire virus is closely related to, or you might say a cousin to, both the flu and the AIDS virus or to more properly say, related to the virus which goes on to cause HIV in humans. This statement simply means V5 is a retro-virus. The things which makes it so difficult to believe, and in fact is why most cannot believe in the existence of the vampire virus, is the lack of general understanding of how the v-virus can and does alter the human DNA to permit the vampire symptoms and maladies to take effect on the once human body. Most people do not believe the human DNA can be so drastically altered. \n\nThis is a strange problem, since all retro viruses (except for perhaps some bacteria which are, of course, not viruses) and one form of RNA, viruses do most commonly change the cell DNA and take over the individual cell's original DNA. It commonly occurs in the flu virus and in the HIV virus, both of which are related to the V5 virus. \n\nTo better understand how this virus works and how genetics plays a part in the inherited factors, we must first look at the basics of human genetic coding and regular and retro viruses.\n\nThose of you who have already had this in class, will see this is basic text book stuff found in any source for the study of genes or genetic coding. You have already read the above basics of genetic coding and how important the sequence of amino acids and bases are to the virus and its function in a cell.\n    \nGenetic coding is the means by which hereditary traits are passed from one human, or other species, on to another of its own kind in birth. Genetic code is the exact chemical equation by which the information making heredity is passed on from the genes to the proteins such as hemoglobin or pepsin. These and other proteins are the ladder which structures the human body. Enliens, pollypeptides, and hormones all serve to regulate these chemical reactions in the body. Chromosomes are located in the Nucleic Acids. \nThe DNA or RNA of each Gene is responsible for making the Protein involved in the development of each trait. Species allow Genes to have the same effect on all its members in the same manner and so effect all its members from generation to generation of that species.\n\nThe codon is the main unit. The Codon is involved with the structure of nucleic acid. Both DNA and RNA are composed of a special sequence of individual units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three smaller units, a phosphate, a slayer, and a base.\n    \nThere are 4 types of Base in DNA. Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine are double rings called PURINES and the last component Thymine, is a single ring component called Pyrimidines in RNA. Uracilis is pyrimidine in RNA, wherever Thymine would be found in DNA. The key is the bases, and how they are arranged, and in which sequence in a chain of single strand of (rnRNA) or DNA. \nThere are 20 different amino acids in proteins but only 4 bases. Nucleotide bases that is. This provides for 4x4x4 different and specific bases, 64 codons. There are more combinations actually but these are all we need to look at right now to realize the structure can be greatly varied as to acids and bases. With the exception of 3 of the 64 codons, each specifies one of the 20 amino acids in the proteins. \n\nMost acids have more than one codon but some have triplets as we have previously seen. The codons which specify are known as the synonyms for the amino acid. During the bonding the protein transfers to the genes the information. This occurs in 2 parts, transcription and translation. The transcription acts as the triplet on which the RNA pollynuecliotide chain, called the messenger RNA (mRNA). \n    \nThe messenger carries the genetic code from the acids to the cell's nucleus, to the nucleus of the ribosomes in the cytoplasms of the cell. During the transcription (mRNA) is attached to the ribosomes which are sections of three actual proteins. (mRNA) CODON determines the sequence of amino acid in the protein. Synthesis each acid is connected to the ribosomes molecule of transcription. (tRNA) which has, in its nucleus, a sequence of three nucleotide bases. Contained in an anticodon, and is complementary to a particular codon in the (tRNA). An attraction hydrogen binding helps alter the RNA and (mRNA). During this bonding a particular amino acid is transferred to the polypeptide chain.\nDoctors originally thought that only one strand, the sense strand, of a double strand DNA contained the actual gene transcription into the RNA directly. The other strand, the antisense strand, was believed to function only as a replication. But this has now changed. It has since been learned that in some cases both strands are transcribed. This is considered a newer break through, something not known a number of years ago. Whichever antisense RNA is transcribed into protein or remains as RNA and may be a regulator to the sequence. \n\nThis is believed but has not been officially established. \n\nIn order for the Acid chain to be divided into sequence, each has to have a specific message signal showing the beginning and end of each sequence. (mRNA) contains a special codon at both ends of this message, one that initiates and one that ends the transcription of the Code. The triplet for the methioine (AUG) is the initiator codon for the protein synthesis. When first formed, polypeptide chains have methinomine as the first amino acid. \n\nDuring the transcription process or after the protein chain is completed some changes are usually made by the cellular entyines, and these form the foundation protein. One of these changes is sometimes the removal of methioine. There are 2 types of cells, eukarotic and prorkryotic. The difference is prorkryotic cells don't have a nucleus and rarely have a membrane. Both have DNA codons called nonsense codons such as UAA, UAG, or UGA ... carry anticodons and cannot be transcribed. (mRNA) codon is found in the messenger.\n    \nVirus    \nA virus is a living organism, a life form. \nIt invades and takes over human cells. The virus invades a cell, kills it or changes the DNA of that cell and replaces the uninfected cells with replications of its own kind. As it replaces the normal cells or changes the DNA in the existing cell, it takes over the function of that cell. The body fights to kill or destroy these cells, if it fails the body can become ill and eventually die from this invasion, called an infection. \n\nThere are 2 kinds of viruses, virus and retrovirus. A retrovirus stores genetic material as RNA instead of DNA in the cells. \n\nRemember that the flu is a virus which contains itself in a protein sphere, waiting for its release when you are more likely to be more confined in the winter months. In the summer although, the flu is also susceptible but one is more likely to be out in the open and less likely to be confined in an area. Thus, spread of this virus through coughing, nasal spray, and contact is more likely during the winter. \n\nIn a retrovirus mainly the genetic material RNA is incorporated into the host cell. Then the virus takes over the function of the cell and in many cases changes or alters the DNA of the host cell while replicating itself. Each time the host cell divides it makes an exact and complete new copy of the new DNA along with its own genes. There are hundreds of viruses, the common flu is a virus as is HIV and LAV which are cousins to the v-virus but manufactures itself in much the same way.\n  \nHIV    \nHuman Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus. \nA type of a virus that stores genetic information as RNA rather than as DNA. When the virus enters a targeted host cell, it releases its RNA and then makes DNA using the viral RNA as a pattern. The viral DNA then is incorporated into the host cell DNA. Each time a host cell divides, it also makes a new copy of the integrated viral DNA along with its own genes. The viral DNA can take over the functions of the cell, become activated, causing the cell to produce new virus particles. \n\nThese new viruses are released from the infected cell to invade other cells. The DNA and RNA factor is the difference between the retrovirus and virus. The vampire virus works in much the same way but does not go on to destroy the immune system. Instead it is coded to replace regular genetic material and alter it in such a way as to cause physical changes in the actual function of several aspects of the human body such as in digestion, slower aging, increased physical strength, mental capacity, etc. \n\nThe Genetic Code has certain characteristics which determine how and under what conditions coding is to be read. The sequence of a nucleotide base is to be read in certain sequences which show the determination of the formations of the cell. Most amino acids in proteins- and there are over 20 of them- have at least 2 codons, however some have as many as 6. \n\nIn a situation in which 2 or more codon words have the same meaning is called a degenerative code. The ability to use more than one codon to specify a particular amino acid requires many different (tRNA) as many amino acids as there are triplets. The correspondents of the number of codons synonyms and (tRNA) results in the correspondence in (mRNA ) transcription. The attraction between the (tRNA) and the triplets of the (mRNA) depends on the correspondents codon and the anticodon. The degeneration of the code has a pattern for all amino acids that have 2, 3, or 4 synonyms for the first 2 bases one or more triplets.\n    \nIn Summary\n    \nGenetic coding is the means by which heredity is passed from one human species to another member of that species or any Species in fact. Genetic code is the exact chemical equation by which the information making heredity is passed on from the genes to the proteins such as hemoglobin or pepsin. \nThese and other proteins are the ladder which structures the human body. Enliens and pollypeptides, hormones, regulate these chemical reactions in the body. To understand more of how V5 acts to change the human cell structure in the human body we need to remember just how HIV works on the body. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus, a type of virus that stores genetic information as RNA rather than as DNA. When the virus enters a targeted host cell, it releases its RNA and then makes DNA using the viral RNA as a pattern. The viral DNA then is incorporated into the host cell DNA. \n\nEach time a host cell divides, it also makes a new copy of the integrated viral DNA along with its own genes. The viral DNA can take over the functions of the cell, become activated, causing the cell to produce new virus particles. These new viruses are released from the infected cell to invade other cells. The DNA and RNA factor is the difference between the retrovirus and virus. In a similar manner does V5 also slowly take over the function of the cells while replicating itself. Definition: similarly affect the cell DNA of the infected vampire.\n    \nThe medical and scientific community will make slowly released announcements in approximately the following order. Release to the general public announcements which have already been made on the TV show nova regarding gene mapping, gene splicing. \nThen the release of a newly discovered or mapped gene found to prolong life, a prelude to this announcement was just accomplished on NBC and ABC recent television broadcasts. \n\nNext announcements on a human life extension program, which it has already done but taking another direction as can be found in the site links elsewhere on the main page of this site. The announcement of a vaccine- not a cure- but a prevention of AIDS, which was released on NBC and ABC in June 1998. \n\nNext shall come the announcement of the newly discovered virus which in itself lead to the Aids \/ HIV Vaccine. And then the announcement of the V5 virus itself. Then finally how V5 lead to the break through for HIV cure and then how the research was actually conducted. Finally telling the world about those people the research was conducted upon. Those actual, living, genuine vampires. \n\nTo get the proof you all seek so desperately all you need do is wait for this time line to play itself out. Its that simple. \n\nHow long will all this take? I do not know. \n\nThe prediction is three to six years as the time line goes. \n\nNot long to wait really.\n    \nNow how does all this relate to the prophecies?\n\n(SEE PROPHECIES LINK ELSEWHERE ON THIS SITE)\n    \nAs you read over the prophecies, think of what happens if the vampires do not want this information getting out. Suppose there is a differing of opinion in the overall world wide vampire communities; for the sake of discussion lets say 50 percent of the vampire population felt this information should not be released as the end result would inevitably lead to a vaccine for V5 as well as Aids. If this occurred what could it mean to the vampiric world? \nThe vaccine I speak of is NOT the HIV vaccine, or the segment known as HIV5, but could be produced as a derivative of the same.\n    \n1. A vaccine, used as part of an Aids preventive, will one day be given to all children under the age of five probably included in their normal childhood shots. \n    \nThese human children grow into adults and some will become volunteers for vampire feeding. \nThe vampires who feed upon this blood ingest the antibodies for the V5 as well since V5 was used in its manufacture. Or that there is also simply a vaccine for V5 given to all children to prevent their being infected once it is believed and understood that real and actual vampires exist. Now the vampire ingests this medically treated blood and the antibodies in the volunteers blood begins to activate on the vampire. If his\/her DNA is altogether changed, it is only the virus taking over the cell functions which is keeping it alive. \n\nTo destroy that virus at this stage, or for the vaccine to affect the vampire DNA at a later date, could mean killing the V5, hence killing the host, death to the vampire itself. \n\nWith the general population so vaccinated there is much less of a food source for the vampire and competition for the remaining available unvaccinated humans becomes fierce.\n    \n2. The information about the vampire can also lead to hunters making weapons to kill the vampire more easily and efficiently. Why then would a vampire want this information to go to the general public? \n    \nWithout a cure for AIDS, in very little relative time many, many millions of humans will die, disturbing the balance of nature. Both their own relation to the environment and the human balance relation to the vampire. \nMany vampires feel this natural balance should not be altered, It is a prevailing belief that humans must be saved to preserve the natural balance and order of the planet and therefore it is most necessary to help cure AIDS. \n\nMany vampires feel it is inevitable that humans will one day find the vampire virus and thus a vaccine for it. It is the hope of the vampires that human kind can be taught to coexist and in so doing may find a way to help the vampire survive. \n\nOn one hand we have those who wish no knowledge given out. Let the humans die of AIDS or anything else, it is natural selection. Then there are the others. 'NO! we must preserve the natural balance at all costs.' \n\nNow reread the prophecies, perhaps they will now make more sense to you. The truth is vampires are indeed real, they are a product of an ages old inherited virus which alters DNA and creates the differences. These kinds and type of genetically caused illnesses are well known today and new viruses are being discovered all the time. \n \nV5 is an ancient illness only now coming into the light of modern day. Its form and reasons are simple and easily understood by anyone with an open mind and willingness to wait for the medical proof to be announced. It will indeed be made known and no doubt disputed at first. \n    \nBut, in the end, the vampire will be nearly as common as the human. \n    \nThe new question then being, if the human cannot live peaceably with its own kind how can there be the needed balance between the human and vampire? \n    \nAnd will either species allow the other to exist at all? \n    \nPlease note: V5 is not the actual name of the virus which causes the Vampiric condition and changed DNA. It is a name we give to it. \nWhy? \n\nSo hunters and others will not know where to actually look in the records should they find them before the Vampiric Communities are ready. \n    \nAs ever,\nCatherene \/ NightPoe\n\nhttp:\/\/www.suite101.com\/article.cfm\/4238\/58538\n\n Vampirism : a medical truth.\n \nAuthor: Night Poe (http:\/\/www.geocities.com\/vampiricstudies)  \nPublished on: January 26, 2001 \n \nRelated Subject(s): Vampires ,  Virus diseases ,  Gene mapping -- Miscellanea  \n My most recent article(s) that \nyou might also find interesting:\n\nDracula's Curse\nThe Psychic Vampire Codex\nThirsty...\n \nThe main reason real vampirism is not more widely believed is the failure of the general public to understand exactly what the virus which produces the condition actually is, or how it functions. Most people do not understand - or believe - that human DNA can be altered in such a way as to produce such a being. Actually, many things can alter a person's normal DNA. Drugs such as LSD and Thalidomide cause DNA changes and many viri (plural form of virus) can change the DNA in a single gene. A combination of these altered genes can change the overall DNA of a living human.\nThe term vampire - used as a medical term - must be separated from the vampire myths; a Viral Vampire is an infected human. Though the DNA in the host human has been greatly altered, the organism remains human in the medical sense as the number of chromosomes has not been changed. All humans - in fact the entire human race - has the same number of chromosomes; the number of chromosomes is what makes them human. Technically the vampire is still a human, but for sake of discussion we think of viral vampires as non-human or as the next step up in human evolution. This is difficult to believe because many of the attributes of a vampire are considered to be better and more developed than humans. The strength, speed, enhanced mental and\/or psychic abilities, the ability to digest human and other blood more efficiently are but a few of the differences. \n\nThe reason this happens is the basic human DNA is altered by the virus. The virus - we call it V5 - is NOT the same virus as HIV5. To simplify, it is transmitted through a simple infection. This infection is gained either through birth or infection from one who has the virus and passes it on. The child inherits the infection, passed on from the mother or father. The parent may have picked up the virus from some other member of their family such as a cousin, aunt, brother, etc. and thus the infection is passed on to the new born child. Rarely are both parents infected, i.e. vampires themselves. More often, they are carriers of the virus, in a similar manner to the way a red haired child is born to a family who, for several generation, have been all blond. The passing of the virus to the child from the parent produces an Inheritor Vampire1 child. The V5 is passed on to the newborn much the same way the AIDS virus is passed from mother to child. In such a child, the virus remains dormant until the catalyst of the onset of puberty. The release of hormones is believed to activate the virus system. \n\nThe effects of the V5 virus then takes a number of years as the child develops to be completely effective, i.e. active in the system from its previously dormant state in the child's body. As in any infection, the child's immune system tries to fight off the infection and in many cases - if not most - it succeeds. It is also believed that the blood chemical make up of the individual is also responsible in determining if the child will be fully affected by the virus and thus DNA altered. Not all infected people develop the vampire virus and thus not everyone born with it becomes a vampire. That is why we are not hip deep in real Inheritor vampires. The only other way to become a vampire is to be given the infection by someone already infected. This would make the person, the subject, a Classical Vampire2. As with Inheritors, it takes Classicals quite a long time to develop the full blown virus once infected due to the same reasons; blood chemistry make up and the immune system. Also, not all Classicals develop the virus. There is also a theory that a person has to be genetically predisposed to V5. V5 is actually closely related to many other viri such as the common flu virus and the AIDS virus. V5 is not the AIDS virus but works in much the same way as to infecting the host. Another reason the reality and cause of vampirism in today's modern world is not more widely believed is because not many members of the public or medical establishment know of the existence of V5. Why don't they know of it? Because, like Ebola and other new illnesses such as the Flesh Eating Bacteria - which actually have not been named so far - we do not know what they are as of this date. V5 has only been known for a relatively short time, many years to be sure, but in regard to other illnesses, a short time.\n\nIt has been many, many years now that several doctors in several parts of the USA and Europe have known about and been studying the V5 and its victims. The studies have been accomplished by long range, personal, one to one research with these infected people. Why so secretive? The same reason as with any other discovery. Once released, the doctors and researchers will gain money, fame and reputation. Not to mention grants, and the licensing of new drugs, etc. For the past few years, ImortalN and I have been telling people of the existence of the virus and explaining the what and why of this illness. We have compared it to other historical illnesses believed to be the cause of vampires in the past. \n\nA few years ago, it was discovered that V5 is related to the AIDS virus. We began telling people then of an impending break through in a vaccine for AIDS. A vaccine for AIDS, discovered from the link to the vampire virus.
