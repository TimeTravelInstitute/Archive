								<div class="bbWrapper">Greetings fellow esteemed colleagues of the TTI, I don't believe I need an introduction.<br />
<br />
This thread was created to consider and debate the possibility, if and when Time Travel becomes humanly possible, will it be wrong to use?<br />
<br />
My opponent for this debate also needs no introduction. You know him as RMT.<br />
<br />
In the tradition of philosophers before us, we will attempt to answer this question and many others, and come face-to-face with the possibilities this technology will impose on mankind and it's ethical use.<br />
<br />
As we begin, please feel free to kindly interject your views if you wish. This is a debate that RMT has asked the TTA to engage him in.<br />
<br />
 <b>This debate will be on the TTA's premise that:</b><br />

Till then, please feel free to begin by asking me anything you have expressed a disagreement with the TTA that stands out to you RMT. Furthermore, all posts made by the TTA on the subject of Time Travel (including those made 6 yrs ago) are fair game in this debate.<br />

The bull is out of it's pen, and the stage is set, shall we begin?<br />

<br />
theoretical issue #1 : Somebody has already initiated time travel, this fictitious person travels to the past, to the future, and alters time so that the entire human race will be destroyed.  They then leave you their time travel machine and tell you that unless time is changed again, all life on planet earth will be gone by tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Do you, knowing the future through anothers interferrence with time, use the time machine to save the planet?<br />
<br />
theoretical issue #2 : in this case, you are fortunate enough to be at Nasa when they spot a huge comet about to impact earth and kill all life on the planet (catch the theme here?).  They say &quot;if only we had known about it a day earlier!&quot; because at this point its too late to do anything.  You, in your infinite wisdom, happen to have access to a time travel device.  Knowing everyone will die the next day and the earth will be shattered into a thousand pieces, and if this information had been known yesterday we could prevent it.<br />
<br />
Do you, either use your device, or at least inform the government that you have such a device at your disposal?<br />
<br />
more to come after we see how you answer these.</div>

</div>I'd say the traditional point/counter-point and &quot;terms of reference&quot; rules should be good enough.  We can try &quot;open fotrum Q&amp;A&quot; but that can often lead a debate somewhere out into the weeds.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />   Either way, I don't care as much about the form as I do the substance.

	</div>
</div>Along the lines of &quot;terms of reference&quot; this point that I have quoted offers us our first &quot;deep&quot; consideration that we must deal with.  Before we can assess the &quot;badness or goodness&quot; (ethics) for the use of any technology, we must have a firm handle on how that technology will manifest.  Being the scientific &quot;traffic cop&quot; that I usually am, I have to point out that speculating that TT will manifest in the &quot;romantic&quot; notion that are prevalent in stories, TV, and movies is invalid for debating ethics of TT usage.  What I mean by this is we could come up with an entire ethical stance grounded on nothing more than &quot;assumptions&quot; about how the technology would become manifest.  If those assumptions prove to be incorrect, and TT manifests in a different manner, then the derived ethical standards would be suspect (and possibly erroneous/flawed).What I am getting at here is that there is little scientific evidence to suggest that the &quot;romantic&quot; notion of TT would ever be the way it would actually manifest.  Namely, the ability to maintain your current composition of Mass while &quot;passing thru time&quot; is highly suspect, and there is little foundation that TT would actually manifest in this manner. This is one reason why I believe it is difficult to debate ethics of a technology with any kind of certainty until you know precisely how that technology manifests (and especially what its limiations are).  It is certainly easy to pass judgement based on wild speculation of what TT  <b>may</b> look like, but such judgement would be based on speculation, not facts.<br />
<br />

	</div>
</div>But don't you think this same statement could be made for any revolutionary technology?  For example, about 100 years ago mankind could not communicate with each other over vast distances in &quot;real time&quot;.  Has the evolution of this technology impacted our spiritual tendencies?  Certainly it has impacted our human advancement.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Here is where I think we need &quot;terms of reference&quot; or standards by which we measure &quot;unethical&quot;.  And once again, we cannot necessarily assume that TT will be implemented in such a way that an existing ethical standard could/would be violatable.  For example, do we wish to speculate that TT will definitely permit causality violation?  So far, science has no evidence that this could come about.Those are my initial replies.  As you can see, I would like to stay away from unfounded speculations because that is really not much of a debate... more just an opinion-speculation festival!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

			theoretical issue #1 : (snip)<br />
<br />
Do you, knowing the future through anothers interferrence with time, use the time machine to save the planet?<br />
<br />
theoretical issue #2 : (snip)<br />
<br />
Do you, either use your device, or at least inform the government that you have such a device at your disposal?

</div>I believe with your theoretical issues you have provided scenarios which support one of my primary contentions in this debate.  Namely, that any technology can be used for &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;, and as such this means that the label of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; is not appropriate to identify any technology.  Rather, the ethics of the use of a technology are more solidly aligned with the intent behind how it is used.Another more mundane example: A firearm is a technology that can certainly aid one in the ethical endeavor of feeding oneself and their family via game.  Yet a firearm can also be used in an unethical (from the standpoint of the 6th Commandment) act of murder.  And all this leads to the tired (yet valid) saying that &quot;Guns don't kill people.  People kill people.&quot;  To me this points to choices for how to use technology as being the focus of ethical issues... not necessarily the technology itself.<br />

</div>Let's focus on this point.  I think it's a good one to start out with.  Is a technology always ethically neutral?  Or, can there be technologies that no matter what are only good or bad?  I think back to my cartoon-watching days.  Some evil villian has invented a death-ray of doom or whatnot.  In a simple scenario, and because the authors of the cartoon wish it, it's easy to see that technology as inherently evil.  But could that same death-ray of doom be used for good, say to blow an impending doomsday comet out of space and thus save the earth?  Of course.<br />
<br />
But, can we think of any technology that COULD be only inherently evil or good?  If we can, then we can move a step further to see if Time Travel falls into the category of a technology that is only inherently evil.  I think that would be the arguement TTA needs to make.<br />
<br />
Let me take a stab at it...ok....let's see.  Ok, a technology that is only inherently evil...hmmm...this may be lame but here goes.  A technology (drug or device -whatever) that forces people to do exactly what they don't want to do.  Could this technology be used for good?  Perhaps if used on evil humans?  Would that make it good?<br />
<br />
You guys see where I'm going with this?</div>

</div>EXACTLY my point.  Thus begs the question &quot;IS there an absolute for ethics and morals?&quot;  Given that, scientifically, Einstein showed (and we all agree) that the mechanics of the universe hold no absolutes, why should metaphysics be different?This is precisely why I don't think you can brand a technology as evil, only how one chooses to use it.  A rock is a rock, but when a rock is involved in the choice of throwing it at someone else's head it MAY be evil... but then again, if that person is coming at me with a knife, then it is self-defense.  NONE of those considerations change the fundamental basics of rock &quot;technology&quot;.<br />
<br />
In my mind it all points back towards INTENTION.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /><br />

Chemical and/or medical castration has been deemed by more than one government to be a &quot;good&quot; use of the technology if it prevents more victims of rape by the same predator.I think one would be hard-pressed to name ANY technology that couldn't just as easily be used for good as for bad.

I'm not sure that comparing a firearm to a time machine is valid. Is it not likely there must be a point at which technology will advance to a point where humanity is incapable of responsably using it? I think (though I may be wrong) that most of this forum's members believe in evolution, and so I will phrase my question taking evolution for granted: If humanity evolves at such a rate that it's brain will expand one cubic cm in 10 million years (an arbitrary figure, but you get my drift) and technology is developping at such a rate that in little over 130 years after the invention of the automobile, we have stealth bombers, Mars rovers, and spy satellites, might not giving <i>homo sapiens</i> a time machine be like giving a baby RMT's firearm?</div>

</div>Perhaps it isn't if you consider only the comparison and not what it is intended to exemplify.  The point I was making applies regardless of whether you use a firearm, a time machine, or a rock.  The &quot;thing&quot; is not unethical, rather how you use it could be.

</div>Well of course, but now am I to understand that you are trying to fit all humanity into one mold?  In point of fact, there are people living in this world TODAY who are incapable of responsibly owning a firearm without using it unethically (or should I just say unlawfully).  So if we try to use the &quot;broad brush&quot; approach then there will ALWAYS be people alive who cannot be trusted with &quot;Technology A&quot; (insert any technology here).  This would then lead to a natural conclusion that we should not develop ANY technology as long as there is one person who cannot use it responsibly.

</div>Yet in our world, today, we DO have stealth bombers, Mars rovers, and spy satellites, but they are not available for use by all.  There are restrictions, laws, and procedures which are purposefully there to PREVENT people who have &quot;evil intent&quot; from using them at their own whim.Whether you realize it or not, your focus on &quot;whether or not we are responsible enough to use it&quot; is really supporting the crux of my first point in this argument, namely that it is not the technology itself that is &quot;evil&quot;, but rather how it is used.  IOW, I do not accept the (apparant) blanket assertion from TTA that the technology of time travel is &quot;unethical&quot;, but rather that the unrestricted use of it could lead to unethical actions (as with any technology we have today, and I do mean ANY).  And I would have no problem debating how one restricts use such that a technology is available for &quot;good&quot; causes (i.e. nuclear technology to generate nuclear power, etc.)<br />

		</div>

	</div>
</div>And in this respect, time travel becomes the ultimate moral/ethical debate, and the only one which matters.  Consider the above scenario, now add that since i've got a time travel machine I can travel to the future and see if the &quot;death-ray&quot; will be used for good or evil.  in doing so, we could always tell what technology we are ready for and when we are ready for it.  defeating the evils of technology once and for all.<br />
<br />
in this example time travel determines the true outcome of a technological choice, by looking into the future, and either accepting its outcome or preventing it.<br />
<br />
overall the best choice would be to develop time travel technology in order to prevent anyone else from using the same technology for harm.</div>

<br />
Can you define exactly what you mean by use of the word &quot;ethical&quot; in this regard?<br />
<br />
Ethical behavior generally relates to the conduct of a defined group of people - a profession, club, industry, etc.  It doesn't, generally, apply to the entire population.<br />
<br />
Moral behavior generally relates to a larger segment of the population such as a particular religion but it still doesn't necessarily encompass the entire population.<br />
<br />
Legal behavior relates to statutory law.  Of the three it is the only code of conduct that includes the entire population.<br />
<br />
Its possible to do an act that violates, for instance, ethical behavior but not moral or legal behavior.  One can switch &quot;ethical&quot;, &quot;moral&quot; and &quot;legal&quot; around at will in the above sentence and have it still be a true statement.<br />
<br />
I'm not making this post to split hairs.  What is ethical to one person may not be seen as ethical to another.   Example, a physician who euthanizes a terminal suffering patient has violated the ethical standards of his/her profession (not to mention the law).  But a veterinarian who euthanizes a terminal suffering patient is wholly within the ethical standards of that profession.</div>

			But don't you think this same statement could be made for any revolutionary technology? For example, about 100 years ago mankind could not communicate with each other over vast distances in &quot;real time&quot;.<br />
<br />
Has the evolution of this technology impacted our spiritual tendencies? Certainly it has impacted our human advancement.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Yes, I agree. I think you and I had a difference in opinion regarding this point originally on the other thread. Probably on the radicalism aspect of it.<br />
<br />
The way it manifests (personally speaking) it 'synchronizes' and brings together all 'actions and decisions' in order to create the end result that we are designed for and coordinated to be. Unduplicatable 'coincidences' are the tell tale signs to this, the violation of human freewill. This is what is translated as Time Travel to the TTA, and why I see it as an unethical practice.<br />
<br />
For example: One can live their life knowing the boundaries of their world, and understand basic judgments of right &amp; wrong. Though, one thinks they have a choice. One acts and feels a sense of accomplishment or failure when this 'choice' is exercised.<br />
<br />
Though, how much of it was really the person's own doing, if someone pulled the strings to arrange it to be?<br />
<br />
If you were placed or moved around like a pawn, isn't it wrong to suggest to a human being that they have freewill, but really take complete command of their lives to fulfill some end result purpose?<br />
<br />

			â€¦.. &quot;IS there an absolute for ethics and morals?&quot; Given that, scientifically, Einstein showed (and we all agree) that the mechanics of the universe hold no absolutes, why should metaphysics be different?<br />
<br />
This is precisely why I don't think you can brand a technology as evil, only how one chooses to use it. A rock is a rock, but when a rock is involved in the choice of throwing it at someone else's head it MAY be evil... but then again, if that person is coming at me with a knife, then it is self-defense. NONE of those considerations change the fundamental basics of rock &quot;technology&quot;
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Yes, a rock is a rock, and people commit unethical acts with objects and technology, I agree with that assertion.<br />
<br />
But perhaps it is not just a question of man simply being irresponsible with the technology, but also being given the option and chance to be.<br />
<br />
If some people are given the chance to take advantage of something or a situation, and think they can get away with it, I think that most will probably do it, IMO. Either from crossing a red light when no one is looking, taking more then 1 free sample, or pocketing a few dollars at the bank they work at; the technology in the places that make things happen may not be what is unethical, but perhaps given the option to exploit them can be.<br />

			I believe with your theoretical issues you have provided scenarios which support one of my primary contentions in this debate. Namely, that any technology can be used for &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;, and as such this means that the label of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; is not appropriate to identify any technology.

			I think one would be hard-pressed to name ANY technology that couldn't just as easily be used for good as for bad. I hate to use another cliche, but it may help us in this debate: &quot;The needs of the many often outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.&quot;
		</div>

	</div>
</div>Ok, any technology can be used for 'good' and 'evil' got that, however in this scenario; let's not pin the ethical dilemma on the technology, but on the appropriateness of the society to allow it's use for the masses.<br />
<br />
Suppose in 4000 years from now, a society possess great power, and intends to utilize a technology that can subjugate an individual's freewill without their knowledge? Why? Because after everything's been said and done, 1 final endeavor remains, and eludes them. Would that be an unethical use of the technology by this society?<br />
<br />
With a bigger picture in place, let's say the survival of the human race and advancement of their spiritual salvation depended on it.  Would the society's actions then seem more appropriate and willing to be accepted?<br />
<br />
In conclusion, is it ever justifiable for a dying race that's done it all, to manipulate mankind to fullfill their purpose?<br />
<br />
And if they have done it and been successful, and their actions can be be verified and proved in the present, where would we stand on the Ethics of Time Travel today?<br />
<br />

			Those are my initial replies. As you can see, I would like to stay away from unfounded speculations because that is really not much of a debate... more just an opinion-speculation festival!
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>And unfortunately, speculation of Time Travel is more in abundance. So where does that leave us with this debate?<br />
<br />
What can we extrapolate as a temporary framework on the nature of Time Travel thus far? Our understanding of it's implementation maybe inadequate, though I think conventional wisdom (or not so conventional for the TTA) may yet be able to suggest to the nature of Time Travel, and the ethical and moral implications of it's use.<br />

We don't allow cheating in sports, in writing, in schools, cheating on any level is wrong, IMO.<br />

</div>What does relate and apply also to an entire population is freewill, IMO. Encircled around them, is also a sense of self and a will to live in their own way. I believe this is basic in the foundation of a society's ethical behavior, and why many differ from our own.<br />

			In reply to:<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
But don't you think this same statement could be made for any revolutionary technology? For example, about 100 years ago mankind could not communicate with each other over vast distances in &quot;real time&quot;.<br />
<br />
Has the evolution of this technology impacted our spiritual tendencies? Certainly it has impacted our human advancement.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Yes, I agree. I think you and I had a difference in opinion regarding this point originally on the other thread. Probably on the radicalism aspect of it.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Most likely it was the radicalism aspect of it.  And I am glad to see you discussing choice and free will in your reply, as I do believe this is a major theme in the use of any technology, whether it be for &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;.Now let me give an example that will set the stage for some of my rebuttals to your later thoughts: I grew up in Ohio, and not too far from settlements of Amish and Quaker people. Proud, hard-working people who have strong ethical and moral codes within their communities.  Yet these two communities also represent excellent case studies with regard to the advanced technology/communications example I gave above.  Neither of these groups of people &quot;accept&quot; (i.e. choose to utilize) various aspects of modern technologies... the Amish much moreso than the Quakers, but the point is to show a gamut of possibilities of choices from our &quot;typical&quot; US culture, to the subculture of the Quakers, to the extreme stances of the Amish.  An interesting side note is that my flight controls boss was also from Ohio and grew up in a Quaker family.  And now here he is the manager of some of the most advanced flight control technology development the world has ever known! The Quakers and the Amish made decisions, as communities, to NOT accept/use/integrate a great deal of modern technologies.  If you research the reasoning behind this, I think you will find a lot of similarities between their reasons and your arguments on why you believe TT is unethical.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

			The way it manifests (personally speaking) it 'synchronizes' and brings together all 'actions and decisions' in order to create the end result that we are designed for and coordinated to be. Unduplicatable 'coincidences' are the tell tale signs to this, the violation of human freewill. This is what is translated as Time Travel to the TTA, and why I see it as an unethical practice.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Now this is where our debate could fall apart because of the differences between <b>belief</b> and <b>actualization.</b> I respect your <b>belief</b> that this is how TT manifests, and that you think it can be implemented such that total violation of human free will could possibly result.  However, as a man of science, I must ask &quot;but is this the way that nature will ALLOW such a technology to be <b>actualized</b>?&quot;  I do not believe so, because it would literally involve having complete control over ALL Mass, Space, and Time in the universe... and the universe just does not work this way when it comes to control... when you gain tighter control of one aspect of a situation, you necessarily lose some other aspect of control over the situation.  Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is another way of stating this: The more accurately I know a particle's position, the less accurately I know its momentum.  Beyond this argument, the amount of Energy needed to be able to control all Mass, Time, and Space would be larger than the total amount of Energy represented by the universe itself (using a thermodynamic entropy view).  Finally, we will really have to examine the intricacies of human free will to know if it is ever possible to totally violate one's free will (which is different than just influencing it).

<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

			For example: One can live their life knowing the boundaries of their world, and understand basic judgments of right &amp; wrong. Though, one thinks they have a choice. One acts and feels a sense of accomplishment or failure when this 'choice' is exercised.<br />
<br />
Though, how much of it was really the person's own doing, if someone pulled the strings to arrange it to be?<br />
<br />
If you were placed or moved around like a pawn, isn't it wrong to suggest to a human being that they have freewill, but really take complete command of their lives to fulfill some end result purpose?
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>A fair enough example.  And  <b>*IF*</b> TT were to manifest in such a way as this, where one could completely subjugate human free will, then the USE of it to do this would certainly be unethical to me.  However, I am far from convinced both that the laws of the universe would permit it to manifest this way, and that the human free will is as limited as such an example would seem to imply.  The issue is &quot;COMPLETE command of their lives&quot; vs. the ability to &quot;influence their lives&quot; in one, or a handful, of ways.  To me, the latter is the only real possibility because of the control/Heisenberg arguments I have provided above.

<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			If some people are given the chance to take advantage of something or a situation, and think they can get away with it, I think that most will probably do it, IMO. Either from crossing a red light when no one is looking, taking more then 1 free sample, or pocketing a few dollars at the bank they work at; the technology in the places that make things happen may not be what is unethical, but perhaps given the option to exploit them can be.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>But I am sure you must see where this argument leads!  One cannot have advancement without also creating a risk.  IOW, the &quot;bad&quot; necessarily comes with the &quot;good&quot;.  So I would equate this type of argument with being equivalent to &quot;even though we could potentially save a great many lives with stem cell research, there are evils associated with it that people could exploit.  Therefore, we should not develop the technology at all.&quot;  And this line of reasoning doesn't end with one technology, but extends to ALL technologies.  This was why I wanted to stress my point about the USE of a technology being the basis of ethics, because it points out that ANY technology can be abused... and is the potential for abuse so bad that we would also not want to avail ourselves of the benefits?BTW, I do not share the pessimistic view of human nature that you seem to hold.  I do not think that &quot;most will probably do it&quot;.  Again go back to the firearms issue.  The vast majority of firearms owners in this country do not abuse this technology.  WHY they do not abuse this technology is likely different for each one.  For some it is our laws, and their respect for them, that hold them in check.  For others, they have a deeper ethic than laws that some might say is the &quot;do unto others&quot; philosophy.  It is an individual decision, and one which hinges on human free will.  I, for one, as a firearms owner see my ability to own and operate this technology primarily as a means of self-defense.  Regardless of formal law, I would not use this technology to rob someone because my internalized model aligns with &quot;do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;<br />
<br />

			Ok, any technology can be used for 'good' and 'evil' got that, however in this scenario; let's not pin the ethical dilemma on the technology, but on the appropriateness of the society to allow it's use for the masses.<br />
<br />
Suppose in 4000 years from now, a society possess great power, and intends to utilize a technology that can subjugate an individual's freewill without their knowledge? Why? Because after everything's been said and done, 1 final endeavor remains, and eludes them. Would that be an unethical use of the technology by this society?
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>OK, again I see you agreeing with my point.  It is not about the technology, it is about its use.  And I certainly agree that you can pose hypotheticals which would show how any technology can be used for good or evil, as you have done here.  What I do not see is a convincing argument that: (a) TT will manifest in the &quot;complete control&quot; means you describe, and more importantly (b) Why you think the potential for evil use of a technology could not be mitigated so that we could enjoy the benefits it may hold.

			With a bigger picture in place, let's say the survival of the human race and advancement of their spiritual salvation depended on it. Would the society's actions then seem more appropriate and willing to be accepted?<br />
<br />
In conclusion, is it ever justifiable for a dying race that's done it all, to manipulate mankind to fullfill their purpose?<br />
<br />
And if they have done it and been successful, and their actions can be be verified and proved in the present, where would we stand on the Ethics of Time Travel today?
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I see you arguing in generalities, rather than specifics.  And the &quot;generality&quot; that I must oppose is based on the notion that the manifestation of TT would allow any form of &quot;complete control&quot; over a person, a society, or the events they live through.  The WHOLE universe operates on ACTION/REACTION.  As such, I think it would be a bit naieve to assume that TT could manifest in such a way that &quot;we, the user&quot; of the tech would have complete control over the &quot;ACTION&quot; part of its use, and that there would be no REACTION that &quot;we, the user&quot; would have to contend with.For example, I brough up causality violation earlier in this thread, and it is a perfect phenomenon to discuss in terms of TT manifestation.  I wonder if you could answer these questions:<br />
<br />
1) Do you believe that TT will manifest in such a way that the &quot;TT user&quot; could violate causality?<br />
<br />
2) If you believe so, then do you not think the violation of causality will result in some natural &quot;reaction&quot; of the universe which the &quot;TT user&quot; (or his technology) would have no control over?<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

			And unfortunately, speculation of Time Travel is more in abundance. So where does that leave us with this debate?
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>IMHO, I think it leaves us right where I figured it would go.  Namely, I do not think we can realistically pass a &quot;believeable&quot; ethical stance on TT technology UNTIL we know its mechanization AND, more importantly, its LIMITATIONS.  We FIRST need to know &quot;what is possible and what is not possible&quot;, because the &quot;what is not possible&quot; part will certainly shape any emergent ethics about the technology.  Furthermore, the &quot;what is not possible&quot; will inform us about how the universe will exhibit a natural response to manipulation of Time.  For example, causality violation.  *IF* we can develop a technology for TT that would allow us to violate causality, what would be the response of the universe?  For all I know, it could completely annihiliate the TT user (or worse).Having this sort of INFORMATION about how TT will REALLY manifest (and its limitations) is an essential step in developing a moral/ethical/legal stance toward the technology's USE.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			Our understanding of it's implementation maybe inadequate, though I think conventional wisdom (or not so conventional for the TTA) may yet be able to suggest to the nature of Time Travel, and the ethical and moral implications of it's use.

	</div>
</div>I respectfully disagree, and the reason I disagree can be summed-up in another time-honored cliche that we use in systems engineering quite a bit:&quot;You don't know what you don't know. And not knowing what you don't know is a serious impediment to you knowing whether what you are doing is 'right'.&quot;<br />
<br />
IMO, we need to &quot;know&quot; a lot more about how we MAY be able to manipulate Time, and how the universe will react, before we can understand its moral implications.<br />

			I grew up in Ohio, and not too far from settlements of Amish and Quaker people. Proud, hard-working people who have strong ethical and moral codes within their communities. Yet these two communities also represent excellent case studies with regard to the advanced technology/communications example I gave above. Neither of these groups of people &quot;accept&quot; (i.e. choose to utilize) various aspects of modern technologies... the Amish much moreso than the Quakers, but the point is to show a gamut of possibilities of choices from our &quot;typical&quot; US culture, to the subculture of the Quakers, to the extreme stances of the Amish.

</div>That's great, if they know the pit falls that the technology could lead to their way of life, more power to them.<br />
<br />
However, who said anything about the technology for Time Travel would just be a mechanical one?<br />
<br />
No-no my good friend, the answer is a lot closer then you may think. For many thousands of years of human thought, we have only hinted to it's surface, but could never penetrate it.<br />
<br />
The big picture has always remained though. And many such as your self believe in the connection to this idea. Thus a New Age approach is applied to this and other concepts.<br />
<br />
What exactly is the TTA suggesting?<br />
<br />
I have never limited my belief that TT would be wrong and come to pass in just 1 form, i.e. strapping one's self to a device.<br />
<br />
Allow me to clarify my self, by citing the following posts from you:<br />

			Several of us here have talked about vibrations, frequencies, resonance and how (scientifically) these concepts of CYCLES are intimately linked with TIME. We can easily witness the energetic power of change that is realized by harmonics and resonance. Not only are these aspects of cycles central to making music (which can affect our emotions in &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; ways), but we also know from mechanics that NATURAL FREQUENCIES at which bodies RESONANT are the points where maximum mechanical energy is released. There are a great many other examples of harmonics and resonance that we can cite from our technologies of today, but these are on a &quot;microcosmic&quot; scale when we consider our solar system, or our galaxy, or even our entire universe.<br />
<br />
The important connection we need to make is that the POWER OF CYCLES (harmonics/resonance) that we observe in the microcosm is also one of the major governing factors of our cosmos on a macocosmic scale. That is literally what 2012 is all about. As scientifically shown in other threads, with other links, the Mayan calendar ends its 13th baktun cycle in 2012, and that corresponds to a special &quot;point in time&quot; that marks a changing from the old cycle to the new cycle. Since our earth, and our solar system, and our galaxy (and indeed our entire universe) operate on cycles, then it stands to reason there are points of &quot;resonance&quot; where the ways in which energy expresses itself in the physical domain are different.... are amplified (just like a NATURAL RESONANT FREQUENCY). And it is further no accident or coincidence that our rapid technological maturity here in the INFORMATION age is reaching quite a crecendo as we approach 2012. It is no accident that we have now completely &quot;sequenced&quot; (cycled?) the human genome prior to 2012. And the human genome, as we know, is the &quot;INFORMATION storehouse&quot; for what constitutes humanity.

			â€¦.The aphysical Spirit/Soul/Mind are equal and opposite to the physical Mass/Space/Time. It is an eternal &quot;dance&quot; between the two... one might say an eternal OSCILLATION!<br />
<br />
And when we start understanding that our aphysical selves are constantly in an oscillation with the equal and opposite physical Massive SpaceTime, this is where we come to understand just how important FREQUENCY DYNAMICS and FREQUENCY RESPONSE and HARMONICS becomes to understanding how to move beyond our current technology. Our science currently has a good handle on Harmonic Resonance and its effects in the physical measures of Mass, Space, and Time. What we must now come to understand is how Mind couples to Massive SpaceTime, and how we can use the principles of Harmonic Resonance between these two elements to achieve &quot;miracles&quot; (i.e. technologies which were previously branded as &quot;miracles&quot; in spiritual texts).

			However, as a man of science, I must ask &quot;but is this the way that nature will ALLOW such a technology to be actualized?&quot; I do not believe so, because it would literally involve having complete control over ALL Mass, Space, and Time in the universe... and the universe just does not work this way when it comes to control... when you gain tighter control of one aspect of a situation, you necessarily lose some other aspect of control over the situation. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is another way of stating this: The more accurately I know a particle's position, the less accurately I know its momentum. Beyond this argument, the amount of Energy needed to be able to control all Mass, Time, and Space would be larger than the total amount of Energy represented by the universe itself (using a thermodynamic entropy view). Finally, we will really have to examine the intricacies of human free will to know if it is ever possible to totally violate one's free will (which is different than just influencing it).

</div>So which way would nature allow it now Ray?<br />
<br />
Ok, let's take a different approach with the Ethics of Time Travel; let's say this is how it works.<br />
<br />
A vast Temporal Network exists with consciousnesses in harmony, suppose we tap into it, and 'influence' the masses through it.<br />
<br />
Not as polished as your posts were, but hey it's been 3 yrs. since I last debated this issue.<br />

			A fair enough example. And *IF* TT were to manifest in such a way as this, where one could completely subjugate human free will, then the USE of it to do this would certainly be unethical to me. However, I am far from convinced both that the laws of the universe would permit it to manifest this way, and that the human free will is as limited as such an example would seem to imply. The issue is &quot;COMPLETE command of their lives&quot; vs. the ability to &quot;influence their lives&quot; in one, or a handful, of ways. To me, the latter is the only real possibility because of the control/Heisenberg arguments I have provided above.

			But I am sure you must see where this argument leads! One cannot have advancement without also creating a risk. IOW, the &quot;bad&quot; necessarily comes with the &quot;good&quot;. So I would equate this type of argument with being equivalent to &quot;even though we could potentially save a great many lives with stem cell research, there are evils associated with it that people could exploit. Therefore, we should not develop the technology at all.&quot; And this line of reasoning doesn't end with one technology, but extends to ALL technologies. This was why I wanted to stress my point about the USE of a technology being the basis of ethics, because it points out that ANY technology can be abused... and is the potential for abuse so bad that we would also not want to avail ourselves of the benefits?

</div>Ok, given that there are no absolutes in the universe and in human inferences; and that risks come with the use of certain technologies, wouldn't something that guarantee's 100% NO risk at using it and 100% results, wouldn't it be worthwhile &amp; beneficial to use?<br />

			OK, again I see you agreeing with my point. It is not about the technology, it is about its use. And I certainly agree that you can pose hypotheticals which would show how any technology can be used for good or evil, as you have done here. What I do not see is a convincing argument that: (a) TT will manifest in the &quot;complete control&quot; means you describe, and more importantly (b) Why you think the potential for evil use of a technology could not be mitigated so that we could enjoy the benefits it may hold.

</div>In response to (a): tell me RMT, based on what you believe about Massive Space &amp; Time, and oscillation etcâ€¦, how can influence and manipulation &amp; exploitation by these means not lead to eventual 'complete control?'<br />
<br />
(b) Ok, let me clarify on what I think Evil is:<br />
<br />
Evil to me, is messing with someone in an unfair and unethical way and not accepting accountability for it or attempting to recognize the error, i.e. stealing, cheating, lying, rape, manipulating their time line and their loved ones.<br />
<br />
What we do presently and what we don't do, with the use of a technology in an evil way is determined and regulated by the laws governing us. With the exception of those with conviction to follow a personal philosophy of &quot;Do unto others...&quot;<br />
<br />
If those laws were to ever change and become arbitrary, let's say no more rights to bare arms, legalized same-sex marriage and other things the current consensus see's as wrong, wouldn't future generations see this as social acceptance of what they would define and think evil, wrong &amp; unethical practices are? Thus, technology once deemed inappropriate, now becomes part of the mainstream norms.<br />
<br />
So when I mean unethical and evil use of this technology, I mean it's evil right now. The benefits are not felt here in the present for us, but in the future (or hereafter). However, the ramifications of those changes in the present, violating human freewill and those who can attest to the symptoms of this approach, is evilâ€¦ though not according to the laws of the future.<br />

			I see you arguing in generalities, rather than specifics. And the &quot;generality&quot; that I must oppose is based on the notion that the manifestation of TT would allow any form of &quot;complete control&quot; over a person, a society, or the events they live through.

</div>Sorry about that (here's another), it's probably a habit of my Jehovah's Witness upbringing, my Alien abductions, my extensive and pricey Co$ training, the voices, the numbers, psychic visions and we can't forget Temporal phasing.<br />

			The WHOLE universe operates on ACTION/REACTION. As such, I think it would be a bit naieve to assume that TT could manifest in such a way that &quot;we, the user&quot; of the tech would have complete control over the &quot;ACTION&quot; part of its use, and that there would be no REACTION that &quot;we, the user&quot; would have to contend with.<br />
<br />
For example, I brough up causality violation earlier in this thread, and it is a perfect phenomenon to discuss in terms of TT manifestation. I wonder if you could answer these questions:<br />
<br />
1) Do you believe that TT will manifest in such a way that the &quot;TT user&quot; could violate causality?<br />
<br />
2) If you believe so, then do you not think the violation of causality will result in some natural &quot;reaction&quot; of the universe which the &quot;TT user&quot; (or his technology) would have no control over?

</div>In response to questions:<br />
<br />
1)	Based on my experience with TT manifestations, I came very close one time in my youth, to pin pointing and unraveling a paradoxal experience in one of my very intense Temporal shifts/phases. Let me try and describe it: you take a djÃ  vu experience many experience briefly, but combine it with voices and other physical reactions, i.e. head ache, goosebumps, nausea. The situation was very vivid; I recall I found my self also re-experiencing the voice in the experience, and taking strong measures previously to counter them the last time, from occurring again this time. I had an actual dialogue with this voice &amp; my self, I was given instructions on what to attempt, and a strong mental block was automatically erected in anticipation of the subjugation of my will and numerical synchronization to this experience on 'queue.'  Perhaps this struggle and the manifestation it's caused to keep an exclusive frame of mind from experiencing this and failed and letting me know of the previous trial and errors, is a sign of causality.<br />
<br />
2)	For me, the subtleness of control is felt in an amplified manner. I doubt many would feel and react to the control the way I did. The reaction I had previously taken, coupled with a strong conviction of freewill, was not only the reason why the TTA was created, but because of the manifestations that many could also be experiencing and feel about freewill, versus those who forfeit it; an opposing view to TT/Alien's/&amp; new age doctrine needed to be known.<br />
<br />
As for causing causality for the user in the future and the universe, I believe that's the whole point.<br />
<br />

			â€¦.Namely, I do not think we can realistically pass a &quot;believeable&quot; ethical stance on TT technology UNTIL we know its mechanization AND, more importantly, its LIMITATIONS. We FIRST need to know &quot;what is possible and what is not possible&quot;, because the &quot;what is not possible&quot; part will certainly shape any emergent ethics about the technology. Furthermore, the &quot;what is not possible&quot; will inform us about how the universe will exhibit a natural response to manipulation of Time. For example, causality violation. *IF* we can develop a technology for TT that would allow us to violate causality, what would be the response of the universe? For all I know, it could completely annihiliate the TT user (or worse).
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Perhaps the universe is designed to compensate and tolerate anomalies &amp; causalities, we yet don't know. If it's able to maintain stability through the chaos of a million atomic explosions, the vast gravity of black holes and devastating effects of anti-matter, why would one little change in time, cause it much of any harm to react, rather then for the direct correlating intended subject?<br />
<br />
The technology we currently yield, does cause much irreversible changes when implemented, significant natural changes to our (Earthly) universe are clearly noted as a reaction. But again, are we talking about a Time Travel device that can have a devastating impact on the universe and have an anti-time effect if causality levels are to severe? Does a volcano explosion cause a chain reaction throughout the globe affecting all land til eventually it will explode, or is the effect only localized within a certain radius, and all life surrounding the incursion goes on, or adapts to the changes?<br />
<br />
Perhaps we should consider TT technology not solely dependent on space &amp; time in relation to it's effect on the universe and causing causalities in the physical sense, but perhaps on a dimension that is accessible and able to be exploited and cause very little harm or reaction to the universe that can also influence those who inhabit space &amp; time. Consider this notion, my Temporal by-pass theory.<br />

			I respectfully disagree, and the reason I disagree can be summed-up in another time-honored cliche that we use in systems engineering quite a bit:<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't know what you don't know. And not knowing what you don't know is a serious impediment to you knowing whether what you are doing is 'right'.&quot;<br />
<br />
IMO, we need to &quot;know&quot; a lot more about how we MAY be able to manipulate Time, and how the universe will react, before we can understand its moral implications.

</div>RMT, I think given the information I have layed out on this post, and citing your beliefs, I think you may be able to find a clear correlation &amp; link to what we are really dealing with here.<br />

I am only sorry that I cannot currently be as thorough in my description and postings as I could have been years ago. One of the prices I had to pay for re-gaining my sanity and living a normal life away from Time Travel.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am glad to say that I have not experienced a temporal shift, manifestations and any majorly strong psychic visions in years. I still experience some numerical synchronicities with the double digits once and a while though.<br />
<br />
Well, let's hope that by switching gears a bit here, it can give us a clearer meaning of the Ethics of Time Travel.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Re: The Ethics of Time Travel: Is Time Traveling W</b><br />
<br />
The only ethics to be discussed is the application not the discovery or the technology as discovery and technology can be neither right or wrong.  Look at nuclear theory as an example.  The discovery of splitting the atom brought about nuclear weapons, nuclear power, and a variety of other things.  A nuclear weapon is neither good or bad.  Some would argue that nuclear weapons have actually kept the world a rather peaceful place and have saved lives by ending the Pacific War early.  Now, you could certainly use a nuclear weapon for evil deeds.  But the weapon itself isnt evil.<br />
<br />
I think the same thing applies to all discovery and all technology.  Time Travel is no different.  For example if you can manipulate time, you could place a dying patient in suspended animation or send them to the future where the medical knowledge exists to help them.  If you could travel back in time, you could make a truely objective recording of history and provide solid physical data to back it up.  You could have a complete cataloging of the evolutionary process that took place on Earth.  You could acquire extinct species of organisms that might hold medical cures or provide solutions to problems.  For every bad idea you can dream up for why time travel should not be pursued, I can find a counter example showing its potential good application.  Again, you can not discuss the ethics of a discovery or technology.  You can only apply ethics to the application of it.  That is why if time travel is ever discovered you would have many layers of regulations and supervision of its application just as you do with nuclear regulation.</div>

TTA,<br />
<br />
I think it may be time for a pause here to clarify some of your points, because I am losing you in your arguments. Bear with me, as one burden of being an engineer is that I need to feel a certain level of clarity of what someone is saying before I commit to any kind of response.  I will try to be tactful in pointing out what I do not understand:<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>And perhaps this is an instance where you were not clear on what I was pointing out?  I was showing how their attitude towards existing technology in some ways mirrors your arguments, and then asking you to contrast that against the more typical way of life in America where we do accept these technologies. They (Amish/Quakers) might consider our use of this technology &quot;evil&quot;, but do WE?  iridium said it best: moral relativism.

	</div>
</div>Not I, although I think the &quot;mechanics&quot; of science will be necessary to find ways to &quot;mechanically induce&quot; TT.  My own personal belief is that the aphysical self (mind/soul/spirit) will be the primary &quot;driving engine&quot; of how TT will be possible, with some mechanical influences from the realm of Massive SpaceTime. I can support some of my beliefs with clues from existing science, as I have in the quotes of mine you have provided.  However, I am not &quot;conclusive or absolute&quot; on precisely how it will come about (yet).

			No-no my good friend, the answer is a lot closer then you may think. For many thousands of years of human thought, we have only hinted to it's surface, but could never penetrate it.<br />
<br />
The big picture has always remained though. And many such as your self believe in the connection to this idea. Thus a New Age approach is applied to this and other concepts.<br />

What exactly is the TTA suggesting?

</div>OK, I am not sure what you specifically mean by this, but I assume you can continue to expound beyond this.  And again I would ask what level of &quot;influence&quot; do you think is capable?  Complete or partial?

	</div>
</div>Again I am a bit unclear when you use non-specifics like &quot;those routes you make mention of&quot;.  However, if what you mean by this is &quot;complete control&quot;, then yes I would say there is no way TT technology could come about in this manner, as evidenced by any other physical phenomenon and what we know (scientifically) about incompleteness.  And as far as &quot;exploited to influence lives&quot; I believe I have already admitted in earlier arguments that ANY technology can be exploited to influence lives (in &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot; ways).

			Ok, given that there are no absolutes in the universe and in human inferences; and that risks come with the use of certain technologies, wouldn't something that guarantee's 100% NO risk at using it and 100% results, wouldn't it be worthwhile &amp; beneficial to use?
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</div>If you can show me something that assures 100% of the benefits and absolutely 0% risk, I'd like to hear about it.  But I believe most in the scientific commnunity know this to be a fallacy, speaking practically from an implementation point of view.

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Because in ALL system implementations there is always incompleteness. One cannot account for everything and all effects that a collective system is subjected to.  You may achieve, for a localized system, some realm of control over some processes but in doing so you forego control over other processes.  It is like squeezing a balloon.  Or to use the words of Aleister Crowley, there is always &quot;the factor that is infinite and unknown.&quot; No one or no thing operating on something in the physical universe can have &quot;complete knowledge&quot; and thus cannot have &quot;complete control.&quot;

</div>If you want to talk about something that I (personally) think is &quot;wrong&quot;, it would be speculating about what our future selves and/or future societies will think about us.  It is sheer speculation and we cannot know at this juncture.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			1) Do you believe that TT will manifest in such a way that the &quot;TT user&quot; could violate causality?<br />
<br />
ANS: 1) Based on my experience with TT manifestations, I came very close one time in my youth, to pin pointing and unraveling a paradoxal experience in one of my very intense Temporal shifts/phases. Let me try and describe it: you take a djÃ  vu experience many experience briefly, but combine it with voices and other physical reactions, i.e. head ache, goosebumps, nausea. The situation was very vivid; I recall I found my self also re-experiencing the voice in the experience, and taking strong measures previously to counter them the last time, from occurring again this time. I had an actual dialogue with this voice &amp; my self, I was given instructions on what to attempt, and a strong mental block was automatically erected in anticipation of the subjugation of my will and numerical synchronization to this experience on 'queue.' Perhaps this struggle and the manifestation it's caused to keep an exclusive frame of mind from experiencing this and failed and letting me know of the previous trial and errors, is a sign of causality.<br />
<br />
2) If you believe so, then do you not think the violation of causality will result in some natural &quot;reaction&quot; of the universe which the &quot;TT user&quot; (or his technology) would have no control over?<br />
<br />
ANS: 2) For me, the subtleness of control is felt in an amplified manner. I doubt many would feel and react to the control the way I did. The reaction I had previously taken, coupled with a strong conviction of freewill, was not only the reason why the TTA was created, but because of the manifestations that many could also be experiencing and feel about freewill, versus those who forfeit it; an opposing view to TT/Alien's/&amp; new age doctrine needed to be known.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I see you have introduced a whole host of subjective experiences in your attempt to answer, but I am afraid whatever you answer was is a bit lost on me.  Again, pardon my &quot;one-track&quot; engineering mind.

</div>This presumption assumes a linear model. I know you are aware of &quot;the Butterfly Effect&quot; which is a small example within the domain of Chaos theory, sensitivity to initial conditions, and highly non-linear phenomenon.  I again refer you to the immediately preceding quote from you: We don't know the effect, and assuming there is no effect based on what observations we do have would not be a valid scientific approach.

			Perhaps we should consider TT technology not solely dependent on space &amp; time in relation to it's effect on the universe and causing causalities in the physical sense, but perhaps on a dimension that is accessible and able to be exploited and cause very little harm or reaction to the universe that can also influence those who inhabit space &amp; time. Consider this notion, my Temporal by-pass theory.

</div>It would seem (that means I am guessing) that you are inferring a TT approach that is solely localized to the aphysical domain (what we call the domain of mind/soul/spirit).  However, I would point out that *IF* theories that state Mind (aphysical) is intimately linked to Matter (physical) then such a technology might not be possible.  But do go on and describe it more...

	</div>
</div>The switching gears here has actually confused me as to your rebuttal and where it is going.  I believe I have made a fairly clear case that:1) We do not yet &quot;know&quot; enough about how TT may manifest to know what its impacts would be on the self or on the rest of the self's universe.<br />
<br />
2) Without this knowledge, we are also uninformed about how the technology (however it may manifest) could be used in a beneficial way or in an &quot;evil&quot; way.<br />
<br />
3) Because we lack this knowledge, the scientific method tells us it is &quot;good&quot; to investigate it and see what we might be capable of developing, for purposes of experimentation and acquiring the knowledge we lack in items 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
4) Until we do this, and understand under what circumstance (if any) causality can be violated, and what the eventual impacts of doing so are, I do not think we can pass ethical judgement on the technology or its potential uses.<br />

			And perhaps this is an instance where you were not clear on what I was pointing out? I was showing how their attitude towards existing technology in some ways mirrors your arguments, and then asking you to contrast that against the more typical way of life in America where we do accept these technologies. They (Amish/Quakers) might consider our use of this technology &quot;evil&quot;, but do WE? iridium said it best: moral relativism.

</div>My arguments may sound quite similar to their stance on technology, but I assure you they are not identical.<br />
<br />
For instance, I can attempt to come to understand the mechanics behind the technology, argue both sides, see their benefit, and then refuse to use it if I believe it's wrong or meet it half-way.<br />
<br />
The Amish however (this may sound like another generalization to some), will not use the technology at all, period. I am not to clear also on the education that they receive growing up, but it would seem that if they are so adamant about not using a technology, then they would also probably not have a strong basic concept on the mechanics behind it. Forsaking something without first knowing how the technology actually works and what it does, is the BIG difference here.<br />
<br />
This may come as a surprise to you RMT, but I wouldn't have a problem with Time Travel, if it was regulated and not used to exploit and manipulate human life. I'm a big fan of the History Channel and National Geographic, and I wouldn't mind seeing history being unfolded through those formats with help of TT.<br />

			Not I, although I think the &quot;mechanics&quot; of science will be necessary to find ways to &quot;mechanically induce&quot; TT. My own personal belief is that the aphysical self (mind/soul/spirit) will be the primary &quot;driving engine&quot; of how TT will be possible, with some mechanical influences from the realm of Massive SpaceTime. I can support some of my beliefs with clues from existing science, as I have in the quotes of mine you have provided. However, I am not &quot;conclusive or absolute&quot; on precisely how it will come about (yet).

I remember watching an episode of Star Trek: TNG long ago, (I may have the details mixed up, so if anyone knows this episode, please do correct me) where officer Barkley was invaded by an alien consciousness that accelerated his thinking process. His perceptive on engineering was way beyond La Forge's, that he subsequently set up a command center from within the Holodeck and created technology to the specifications provided by his mind; took control of the ships engines and took the crew to the center of the galaxy.<br />
<br />
I think this would be an interesting technology to develop. You'd plug your self into a virtual reality universe, and it would extract abstract concepts from your mind and like magic just do the leg work of extrapolating together &amp; add math and physics for it's instant implementation.<br />
<br />
Since the TTA is not a scientifically based individual (can't make sense of hardcore formula expressed science), I do however have a very keen sense of imagination, and MacGyver like ability to see contingencies in many challenging situations. Perhaps that is the reason behind the alien abductions &amp; temporal phasing; the schematics I possess for devices yet not created cannot be utilized unless extracted. Who knows?<br />

</div>I know we have many more disagreements then agreements on this issue, since we both have very different specialties and approaches to TT. Your scientific manner is crucial in the debunking realm of those who claim to be from the future, who knows how many lives you and others may have saved from following a cult of lies, by simply shedding light and exposing them. This is very admirable and commendable what you and others have done, you have done something that the TTA could not do. You have my sincerest respect.<br />
<br />
My approach on the other hand, is more empathic and intuitive to subjective feelings and visions, the feelings of injustice and of having humanities freewill subjugated. Experiencing the effects on a daily basis, and in anticipation of this technology and of it's potential for evil control; I did what I had no other choice to do.<br />

			It would seem (that means I am guessing) that you are inferring a TT approach that is solely localized to the aphysical domain (what we call the domain of mind/soul/spirit). However, I would point out that *IF* theories that state Mind (aphysical) is intimately linked to Matter (physical) then such a technology might not be possible. But do go on and describe it more... I could be way off in my guess of what you are getting at!

</div>If the mind is linked to the physical body, and the body can influence matter, isn't that Time Travel affecting space &amp; time via route 'mind/soul/spirit?'<br />
<br />
For instance, I once considered the use of tachyon particles as a means of piggy backing on thoughts, thus causing influence to a past or future juncture within a network exclusive to one's own unique vibrating frequency. Thus also making DjÃ  vu possible.<br />
<br />
Developing a technology to increase and amplify the capacity of the mind, increase the % of usage. Who knows what we may be able to accomplish and discover through this means. We may yet find if Time Travel correlates and crosses through the 'mind/soul/spirit' domain. What then?<br />
<br />
Just how the macro can link to the micro, can't the energy or will of space &amp; time have capillary type appendages attaching to a mind/soul/spirit?<br />
<br />
You tell me RMT, what link do you know of between the physical and aphysical domains?<br />

Since I'm the Ohio boy, who lived near them and knew some of them, I can assure you that their culture has its exceptions.  They are not AS strict as you might imply with your &quot;period&quot; statement.  In fact, their &quot;hard-fast&quot; rule is that THEY are not permitted to OWN or operate any of these certain technologies.  For example, an Amish person would never own an automobile.  But do you think they have a rule of never being allowed to ride in them?  (Their rule: &quot;No one shall operate cars or trucks.&quot;). This does not prohibit an Amish member from riding in someone else's car, especially in the case of an injury of one of their community.  They are not going to tell a city ambulance &quot;no, you cannot take them away to the hospital in that ambulence.&quot;  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />   There are other examples, so this is just to give you the flavor.

With their plain style of dress, straw hats, suspenders, and buggies, it is not difficult to see why so many of us perceive the Amish as having a hatred of technology. In reality, the Amish do not despise technology and even have incorporated many technologies into their culture. Other technologies, however, have been rejected completely or used within certain limitations as a result of deep religious beliefs and the rules that guide and maintain their distinct culture.

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Re: Choices &amp; Free Will</b><br />
<br />
Much has been discussed. Whether time travel anyone is talking about is physical or just mental has not really been defined. Since people do know that other people including about everyone does time travel in some respect by mind mainly since the future has not happened yet into the future so boldly, I can only surmise that again the term time travel has to apply to the individuals that may use it someday. (if that is even possible to physically time travel) Since traveling into the future is only done in a general way with the mind, first one must define who and what may decide to use it, and if it will be for public use, or held back for some reason to only a limited use (physical time travel that is.)<br />
<br />
I think that it's moral use depends on what time is and how it will come about by explanations of the subject.<br />
<br />
I therefore conclude that understanding the complete process of nature (or say a similiar term like the Universe) may make technology so overwhelming someday (as to what can be done with any of it) as to say that technology will make humans develop morals or else be dead in a flash much like antimatter used for some purpose other than the uses it may be used for. So as technology increases, the few who can use it, or harness it's extreme power will also have to design security features into the system that makes any such system about totally useless, unless those scientists are the only ones who know and can design such security systems. Yes, it could be a joint effort by such a team and still used for general consumption like anything else, but to me there will be a day that God calls the Reckoning.<br />
<br />
So, I have to assume as of now that there can be no day when technology is so advanced that people will continue to use it in some normal fashion. It is not the technology, it is the morals of the species that will enter into some advanced form of technology.<br />
<br />
The explanation of 'time' is the only way to have a discussion on whether it can be used or not.<br />
<br />
Conceiveably you will never want what is going on with some people across this planet to ever learn or be able to make -- antimatter. Even though it would take large quantities of such technology, such a technology is so inherently dangerous to most people that with very advanced technologies -- those technologies may never be made anymore, because of security concerns with those technologies even though the debate continues over using those very advanced technologies or not.<br />
<br />
So, perhaps God already has that advanced technology and is also wondering whether man will use that technology as a Reckoning type of day, or perhaps God will have to use that very advanced technology as a Reckoning Day.<br />
<br />
I reckon that therefore I can not give an answer to this discussion about time travel then. I simply may not know enough about what 'time' is to even gather up a stupid answer, let alone an intelligent answer.<br />
<br />
Therefore I quit for now this discussion on whether time travel should ever be used. As I see it now being used, I have my doubts if humans can ever make it through this upcoming time period with what is going on in this World.<br />
<br />
The other sciences have not kept up with &quot;Living somewhere else in this Universe&quot; or even &quot;Out of this Universe&quot;.</div>

			You're right... it not only may sound like another generalization, it might actually be one!  How much do you know about the Amish people to be able to make this generalization? Since I'm the Ohio boy, who lived near them and knew some of them, I can assure you that their culture has its exceptions. They are not AS strict as you might imply with your &quot;period&quot; statement.

			In today's world we know about the problem of &quot;religious fundamentalism&quot;, and I am not only referring to Islamist terrorist groups. There are Christian fundamentalists with some wacked-out ideas (Pat Robertson, anyone?) as well as Jewish fundamentalists. But how often do we even consider that there might be a subculture that might best be described as &quot;atheist fundamentalists&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've seen the signs. There is such an undercurrent of people out there. And the point of ANY form of fundamentalism is the extremeness of belief, and a general lack of balance (either acceptance or tolerance of) opposing ideas. I am sure most atheists detest having anyone from any religious belief try to &quot;shove their ideas down my atheist throat&quot;. But how often do atheists ever look at themselves, and see if they might be just as &quot;vehement&quot; in how they try to &quot;convince&quot; believers that there IS no God? I've visted many science forums, and some of them are less science forums than they are a place for atheists to willfully &quot;shove their atheism down the throat&quot; of any theist who happens to express an opinion or try to show them some (indirect) evidence for a God.<br />
<br />
The rule of the &quot;New Time&quot; (and I know Zerubabbel agrees with this, and perhaps we will hear from him) is that ALL forms of extremism are on their way out. And even if they don't think they are on the way out, they will find some help from an &quot;usher&quot; of sorts when we reach &quot;the end of ordinary Time&quot;.

<br />
On the same token, we can also add &quot;NewAge fundamentalists&quot; to the list. I wouldn't think they would be 100% exempt from also following a fundamentalist view and approach? I think it's safe to say if &quot;all forms of extremism are on the way out&quot; as you put it, then this would also include those who follow some form of a NewAge doctrine, whatever that may be.<br />
<br />
The TTA has had much experience with NewAge fundamentalists in the past, and many would rather have us adopt and join a NewAge doctrine bandwagon by use of their euphemistic language, over that of orthodox belief.<br />
<br />
But we can elaborate further on that as the debate continues  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /> .<br />

</div>My approach may sound 100% conservative in TT being unethical, but I have always suggested that it should be regulated, even 6 yrs ago. It's just that I focus mainly on the unethical use of it, more then on the regulated use. First hand personal experience I suppose.<br />

Ahhhhhhhhhhh ha!! So Javier this is the way that you set the stage for readers to get involved in the Titor story, by implanting the idea of 'time travel being unethical'.  Hot dam, this is one diabolical Role Playing Game!! I've never looked at it from this angle before?<br />

			Whatever else the story has done, maybe there is a deeper matter as well. A higher purpose that the writer almost certainly intended. Which is to show that we're all vulnerable to the glamour of Time Travel. The whole point is to feel its pull and then reject it. That's why it was compulsory for the TimeTravelActivist to fashion a dual character.

</div>There are so many flaws in your reasoning about time travel.  First to get over the hump of it even being real or possible, which has NOT been scientifically proven and is still open to controversy. AFAIC, its all iddle talk and unfounded information. And with that said, it seems you will still push to attempt to trap us within this flimsy mind frame when in reality its all nonsense!!  Pure speculation of 'what if' with no real foundation for validity, though you stress it as a moral issue. LOL, I see sith lord has spoken again!!<br />
<br />
Javier, there is no violation of human freewill except in your &quot;own&quot; mind, or those marginal thoughts that you wish to implant in others. If you yourself wish to believe this dung, than it will forever dominate and hinder you.  LOL, but I dont think that is the case. I think you've played around with this sociological concept and have decided to put it to the test on the weak minded.<br />
<br />
As far as whats &quot;evil&quot; and whats &quot;good&quot;, they both work hand in hand, but to your disbelief<br />
<br />
Javier, ALL FOR GOOD!! An excelent example of this would be Jesus' death on the cross, where his whole purpose justified the end. Just look how powerfull his message has become. LOL, no not your message, BUT HIS!!<br />

And that my friend is 100% FREEWILL!! None of these things can hurt you if you simply look for the best scenario of how to deal with them.  For example I read this book about a man who was a POW.  They had him locked up behind bars and fed him fish bones in water.  He learned to train his mind to except that the soup was the greatest gift and something beautiful to look at.  He looked forward to receiving it each day because it was keeping him alive through spirit of the mind, and he survived. NOW THAT'S POWERFULL!! and not your dantes inferno filled with layers of limbo that you wish us all to see!!<br />

</div>I'm curious, is this voice you had a dialogue with, John Titor? You are sicker then I previously thought Javier. If one believes they are a time traveller, the idea that comes in here is that &quot;CONSCIOUSNESS&quot; is taking advantage of expertise available elsewhere, elsewhere than the travellers brain.  So where is the expertise?  And here comes the quantum idea of soul.  Quantum idea of the soul is that soul can exist as character of people that have alleged to time travel or died before. This is nothing more then the workings of the natural brain and its ability to perform ridiculous suggestions that trick it into believing it has the ability.  LOL, like I said earlier Javier, you are a legend in your own mind!!  None of Johny boys predictions came true, and I aint gonna start believing to allow them &quot;in my mind&quot; to come true!!<br />
<br />
This is a form of mind manipulation that you have attached to yourself AND NOW DAMMING ON OTHERS (or implanting the suggestive thoughts that they are being time manipulated and have no freewill).  LOL, its all horse pucky and there is no point in you continuing this indoctrinating conversation because its all pointless and mute!! And as for your side kick Darby his post is also manipulating as he's trying to get us to 'focus' on the  'one word' (ETHICAL) to try and direct our thoughts more in your direction.

</div>Well, I agree that perhaps you did not use those specific words, per se.  However, some of the words that I had quoted from you in the earlier thread (which gave birth to this thread) sure did sound like you were taking this kind of stance:

<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

			However, one cannot categorize Time Travel along with the theory that the world is round or that we evolved from lower species. Or can we? Let us play 'Devil's Advocate' for a moment and look at this. These theories were both new concepts at a time, much how Time Travel is for us today. And yet, all have harmed our past, and affected the outlook of our future.  (snip)<br />
<br />
Do we tempt faith, and change the past and the future with Time Travel?

</div> While you are always free to change your mind (as we all are), I am not sure I agree that &quot;all&quot; of these theories have &quot;harmed our past&quot;.  And while theories of where we came from and where we live certainly DO affect our future (actually, that is one of their purposes), I would claim that they may have affected our futures in more a positive way than a negative way.  But again, &quot;bad&quot; will always come along with &quot;good&quot; because of how some people will use technology, energy, or information.

</div>The book where Dawkins introduced this concept is called  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192860925/104-6796243-5311905?v=glance&amp;n=283155" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">The Selfish Gene</a>. But I first read about the concept in a different book by Daniel Dennett called  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316180661/104-6796243-5311905?v=glance&amp;n=283155" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">Consciousness Explained</a>. Don't let the bold title fool you.  I don't think he comes terribly close to actually &quot;explaining&quot; consciousness, but I did find some interesting nuggets in it, and found it a good read.  In fact, these two books were large motivators for my own work to develop the &quot;INTENTION-&gt;Information-&gt;Energy-&gt;Force/Moment&quot; hierarchy of action/reaction.  I would probably describe Memes (in my own words) as systemic groupings of processes which feed on and give off information.  But Dawkins might not agree!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />

</div>Well, if we went by the formal rules of debate, I don't think it would be termed a draw, although it might also not be at its end.  You were the one who stated a claim that you believe is true.  I believe I (and others) have provided several rebuttals to at least hack away at any claim that the use of TT would always be unethical, including in trying to achieve spiritual enlightenment.  Moreover, I think I have established that until we have scientific evidence for how TT can manifest such that it is regularly useable by mankind, it is difficult for us to pass ethical judgements upon it.  In my own mind (and maybe we need others to chime in here), I think I have done more to hack away at your claim than you have done to show its validity.  But again, that is just my view... not saying it is gospel.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" />

Such as my statement about God being in COMPLETE control vs. our Free Will.  Is it not true that you have a Free Will and that God cannot force you to do one thing over another?  Indeed, this is a foundational point used by atheists that there is no God!

			I think I may have an idea what you're getting at, but at this point I am merely now guessing. Do you mean following a model like the Tree of Life and other ancient systems of utilizing math to find correlations to a divine purpose &amp; meaning? If so, I am quite familiar then with this approach.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>You might know &quot;that&quot; approach, but I assure you that you don't know &quot;my&quot; approach.  Your description is fairly general, and I would say that there are elements of my approach that may validate your statement.  However, to be clear: I do not START with ancient systems or the Tree Of Life and work backwards.  I start with existing scientific relationships and fundamental properties of mathematics, and work towards validating them within the geometric and mathematical aspects of the Tree Of Life (and note I purposefully ommitted the &quot;mystical&quot; portions).  If you wanted a generalization of my approach, I would say it would be more along the lines of a systems engineering approach to getting where/what you want, which has been enhanced by discovering correlations between this form of engineering/science and the geometry/math of the Tree Of Life.

			With all due respect RMT, one may say these &quot;religious fundamentalists&quot; as you call them, are also following a &quot;Mathematical Model&quot; in the sense that they also have an intricate reason why they do what they do, and how they do it.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>You could say that, but I think you would be stretching the use of the term &quot;mathematical model&quot;.  I can actually show people my REAL mathematical models (implemented on tools as simple as Excel and as complex as MATLAB/SIMULINK) that project my activities into the future.  Religious fundamentalists (generally) can only point to their books, and cannot seem to explain the paradoxes and outright falsehoods within them that they still claim as &quot;gospel&quot;.  I broke with the Catholic church at a young age because of the lack of correlation between &quot;Church Law&quot; and Natural Law.

			On the same token, we can also add &quot;NewAge fundamentalists&quot; to the list. I wouldn't think they would be 100% exempt from also following a fundamentalist view and approach? I think it's safe to say if &quot;all forms of extremism are on the way out&quot; as you put it, then this would also include those who follow some form of a NewAge doctrine, whatever that may be.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>You certainly might be able to add these people to the list.  But it is difficult to group all people with beliefs that differ from &quot;conventinal&quot; religions under one banner called &quot;New Age&quot;.  Although I know a lot of people like to make such a generalization.  Again, to me the proof is in the pudding.  While you may call a certain, specific practice &quot;New Age&quot;, you really need to understand that approach in-depth to see if there is any scientific correlation or validation, because that is a major element which separates such an approach from the traditional &quot;religious fundamentalist&quot; approach where their only answer to a question is &quot;because God said so in this book...&quot;Indeed, when I discuss extremism there are two extremes where &quot;fundamentalism&quot; can arise in an unbalanced manner: Spirituality AND Science.  If you take either of these two as an extreme position, IMO you are &quot;incomplete and unbalanced&quot;.  However, when you try to form an approach to BOTH with elements of BOTH (some may lump this under a generalized New Age banner), I believe what you end up with is a balanced approach that avoids the extremes of either of the two positions.<br />

</div>I know the types you speak of, and yes they are out there.  But you should be careful that you don't dismiss some approaches as being this without digging into their beliefs to see if they can be validated in any manner by science.I've pointed you towards the concepts of the Meme, and also discussed things like Chaos Theory and fractals.  These, and many other, elements of emerging science are changing the landscape of the two extremes I mentioned above (Science and Spirituality).  The current work on Dark Energy is another one that is bringing these two disciplines together.  If there is one overarching theme that these &quot;new sciences&quot; are coming closer to validating, it is the ancient spiritual/religious belief that &quot;we are all One... ALL in the universe is ONE.&quot;  One can even analyze the universe systemically in this very manner.<br />

</div>IMO, this would we a different debate.  As the more we discuss spiritual traditions and &quot;who is right or wrong&quot;, then I think we are veering away from a discussion of whether we should develop (and regulate) the ability to TT.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</div>And that's a good thing.  Similarly, on this board I focus on what I believe to be the &quot;unethical polluting of future potential&quot; with hoax TTers claiming we are heading for armageddon.  So again, with regard to this debate it would seem to me that you came in with a pretty strong &quot;it is wrong&quot; stance (when you consider other things you have written in the past) but now it seems you have conceded many of my points which may soften the &quot;it is wrong&quot; stance.  Yet we both agree that &quot;it can be used in a wrong way for bad purposes.&quot;

</div>I dunno.  You might call it an &quot;offshoot&quot; of the same debate, but I'd say it would be starting a new/different one.One hallmark of a well-structured debate is having a CLEAR statement of the debate's premise when going into it.  Given our last few discussions on spirituality, I do not (yet) see a clear premise about it that we would debate.  That is why I would suggest you work on defining some sort of CLEAR premise that would kick-off a new debate.  That way we both know what the primary issue (truth or falseness thereof) is that we would be debating.<br />

<br />
It seems the premise for this debate would be that time travel is not only possible, but assumed to be a reality.<br />
<br />
The basic ideal already put on the table by Ray was INTENTION.<br />
<br />
As far as a historical study goes, intentions may have been for &quot;positive&quot; progress, or assumed that the technology would be utlized for such a goal, has not been adhered to by those willing to exploit anything to give them an advantage.<br />
<br />
This brings me to the next ideal that would effect a time traveler.<br />
<br />
JUSTIFICATION.<br />
<br />
If the time traveler follows the best of intentions, yet has a family member harmed by another, would this time traveler feel&quot;justified&quot; in righting a wrong, from his/her point of view?<br />
<br />
Every faction in the world today feels &quot;justified&quot; by their actions.<br />
<br />
With time travel as a reality...I foresee many problems arising IF accessible to many different people.<br />
<br />
Under the circumstances of our modern society, I think time travel would be used for unethical reasons...even if a set of &quot;rules&quot; could be established.<br />
<br />
As we become more of a global community, I think most people &quot;know&quot; whats right, but ignore this knowledge.<br />
<br />
And the mention of God to enter into this debate seems unavoidable.<br />
<br />
To make my stance clear...<br />
<br />
I agree with TTA, that time travel would NOT be a good idea.<br />
<br />
However, if the opportunity came up to do it...I would jump at the chance to go.  And I believe that everyone would also do the same.  It may be easy to say no when it is merely a concept, but if someone showed up with a real machine, I dont know of anyone who wouldnt travel in time, regardless of what position they are taking now in these forums.<br />
<br />
I believe that ethics would be tossed to the wind, and personal( emotional) motivation would rule time travel.</div>

</div>Great point!<br />
<br />
Over the years we've seem dozens of would be &quot;time travelers&quot; here and on other sites.  Though we're not sure what the effect of time travel might have in the real world (whatever that really means) I've been struck by one continuing theme...the time traveler never profers any logical justification for the trip.<br />
<br />
Whatever the effect, moral, ethical or legal, that time travel would have it would be an expensive venture for a society in time, manpower, resources and money.  Surely such a society would have a better plan than the theme that we've seen - &quot;I'm here from 2035 (2025, 2036, etc.); the world is doomed; everything that could prove me true is a secret and I can't answer any tough questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
What's the point?  Why would a society make such an investment just to send someone here to play an online game of 20 questions?<br />
<br />
Javier has raised some serious questions.  In fact, this thread is the point where I first entered the time travel forums six years ago.  Javier was involved in that thread then: &quot;The Ethics of TIme Travel&quot;.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Re: Choices &amp; Free Will</b><br />
<br />
I have often wonder the same thing regarding the reasons &quot;why&quot; time travelers show up here in TTI.<br />
<br />
I would think that there are dozens of other places a time traveler would go if they truly wanted to establish themselves to be from the future, such as some University or similar organization.  Even if we, here, decided that someone was indeed from the future, big whoop.<br />
<br />
I would love to overhear a time traveler reporting to his/her superior(s) regarding the &quot;expedition&quot; to the past.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you accomplish Time Travel Team&quot; ? ...<br />
<br />
&quot; We posted on a website called Time Travel Institute. We successfully convinced Darby and RainmanTime that we are from the future&quot;!<br />
<br />
I dont see this as an accomplishment for the efforts required to travel back to our time period.<br />
<br />
( Even though it would be a great accomplishment to actually do so....  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick out tongue    :p" />  )<br />
<br />
..................................................................................................<br />
<br />
As far as the ethics of time travel are concerned, I dont really have alot to say on that, excepting what I mentioned above.  Ethics is a fickle thing, subject to change in a flash.  What we consider ethical today, may change tomorrow.<br />
<br />
And yes, Javier has given us some serious questions to consider.<br />
<br />
The thought that keeps coming up is the idea that IF time travel is a reality, then it would be occuring as we speak.  And if this is so...then &quot;they&quot; are among us now.  The places they would be would be easy to guess, in a general sense, not an exact location.<br />
<br />
Now, if &quot;they&quot; are active in the past, what have they done ?  Remained silent, or &quot;assisted&quot; with a few things here and there?<br />
<br />
I.e., Perhaps DaVinci was influenced by a traveler in time, and I am NOT referring to the DaVinci Code that is popular right now.<br />
<br />
Justification is so important in this issue...<br />
<br />
I consider myself close to God.  I try to stay on the &quot;correct&quot; path as laid out in the Bible,<br />
<br />
HOWEVER...HOWEVER...HOWEVER...<br />
<br />
How many times have I wandered away from those guidelines because I have felt  <b>justified</b>  to do so ?<br />
<br />
And what are my justifications based upon ?<br />
<br />
I really could give a rats behind what society or anybody thinks under certain circumstances, and will act according to my internal motivations.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what would happen with a time traveler.  Everything may be great, until some force within that individual overcomes the general( accepted by a group ) sense of right or wrong.<br />
<br />
If a time traveler is witness to the collapse of the twin towers in NY, and is told not to interact in anyway, but has a small child within reach that is in peril...???<br />
<br />
The overall sense of acting within the timeline maybe tossed aside for personal reasons, justifying the saving of that child.<br />
<br />
And who knows, maybe there was a future that Hitler won.  Maybe Germany developed the Atomic Bomb first... or any other of possible actions the regime could have taken.<br />
<br />
I have heard that Hitler had dreams that guided him in his actions...a time traveler making sure he wasnt successful?<br />
<br />
Whose to say ?<br />
<br />
And would that be ethical or justified ?</div>

I agree with TTA, that time travel would NOT be a good idea.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Fair enough, and I can certainly make my stance clear:I cannot agree that ANY new technology is inherently a &quot;bad&quot; idea UNLESS and UNTIL that technology can be fully quantified and turned into an engineering applications science. Because just like the history of our development of flight technology, we didn't know how GOOD or BAD the technology could be until we had fully investigated it and developed it.<br />
<br />
And I believe aviation (among so many other technologies of electronics and systems) has served us quite well as a result of our earnest WILL to develop these technologies... FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND.<br />
<br />
I believe that &quot;time travel for anybody&quot; would be wrong, just like I believe that not everyone is fit, or capable to fly a commercial aircraft, or fly a space shuttle, or launch a satellite, or be a law enforcer, or operate on people, or so many other highly-specialized positions. There are many things in our society that you must show you are &quot;qualified&quot; to do so you do not hurt yourself nor others.  But until we understand what our limitations would be if we could achieve TT, it is hard to evaluate just &quot;how badly it could be used.&quot;<br />
<br />
I keep pointing out causality violation.  This is a big question, and I am surprised that you are not agreeing with me Darby.  If we are supposed to assume that TT will manifest such that someone could CAUSE a causality violation in another timeline, then we are talking about a powerful technology.  As long as we have no objective evidence for any causality violation, in our universe or any other, then the &quot;power available&quot; with TT technology would not be as dangerous and disasterous as some might believe.  Any universe that permits a causality violation without any dynamic, resistant response would not seem to jive with what we know about Action and Reaction, at all levels of physics.<br />
<br />
Am I somehow incorrect in this?  Is this not an important thing to know about the overall response of the Massive SpaceTime continuum?  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /><br />

<br />
You know the interesting thing about relative truth (or subjective truth)?  It really exists.  However, it doesn't always have to exist.<br />
<br />
Take the following example:<br />
<br />
Two men stand in a forest.  They are 100 yards apart.  A single tree stands directly between them.  The tree falls.  Each man is asked which way the tree fell.  Man A says the tree fell to the left.  Man B says the tree fell to the right.<br />
<br />
In this case, they are both correct, but if they argued with each other, they would be convinced the other was wrong.  So how do we reconcile this?  We look to a standard that is outside the both of them.  We say, the tree fell to the NORTH!<br />
<br />
Many things in life are like this and the solution is the same.  Look to a standard that is outside of the situation.  By doing this, we can counteract the subjectiveness of INTENTION and JUSTIFICATION.<br />
<br />
Some people will argue that you can't paint the world black and white like that.  Oh, can't you?  Some say the only absolute truth is that there is no absolute truth.  What a self-defeating argument!<br />
<br />
What does this have to do with this discussion?  I don't know...I think I forgot.  Oh yeah...we are talking about highly subjective issues...Ethics, Intentions, Justifications, etc.   So I just thought I'd throw this out here.<br />
<br />
You know the one infuriating thing about this though?  If Man B absolutely will not acknowledge that there even is a NORTH let alone which direction it is.  Then we have a problem.</div>

			The book where Dawkins introduced this concept is called The Selfish Gene. But I first read about the concept in a different book by Daniel Dennett called Consciousness Explained. Don't let the bold title fool you. I don't think he comes terribly close to actually &quot;explaining&quot; consciousness, but I did find some interesting nuggets in it, and found it a good read. In fact, these two books were large motivators for my own work to develop the &quot;INTENTION-&gt;Information-&gt;Energy-&gt;Force/Moment&quot; hierarchy of action/reaction. I would probably describe Memes (in my own words) as systemic groupings of processes which feed on and give off information. But Dawkins might not agree!

			.....Moreover, I think I have established that until we have scientific evidence for how TT can manifest such that it is regularly useable by mankind, it is difficult for us to pass ethical judgements upon it. In my own mind (and maybe we need others to chime in here), I think I have done more to hack away at your claim than you have done to show its validity. But again, that is just my view... not saying it is gospel.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Yeah... I guess you have. Or perhaps it's gone exactly the way I thought it would. It could be that by establishing a common ground we can both agree on, the revelance of what I have said or will say, will continue to unfold and make my case in this debate.<br />

			Ugh. I think we need a &quot;barfing&quot; emoticon.  Really, I am not into expounding my spiritual beliefs unless there is some semblance of scientific reason that is available to demonstrate them. Such as my statement about God being in COMPLETE control vs. our Free Will. Is it not true that you have a Free Will and that God cannot force you to do one thing over another? Indeed, this is a foundational point used by atheists that there is no God!
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Yeah, I know... but I am also taking a risk expounding my spiritual beliefs without science to back them up.<br />
<br />
On the subject of God, I hope to call upon certain experts in this field. The TTA does not wish to disrespect bona fide religious sects by attempting to speak for them. Unless it's a NewAge cult, then it's on!<br />
<br />
If freewill is given to each of us, as it is said, and whether God is in control of our eventual end, is another thing. But when some force is introduced in-between and interferes with our freewill, that's a crime against humanity.<br />
<br />
This can be called by many names: some would call it spiritual warfare, I call it Time Traveling.<br />
<br />
Something's in the background, the TTA along with countless others know this. Gears are being turned, motivating and influencing us without our consent; manifesting it's self by strange phenomena that cannot be explained by science. Experiences that can only be experienced by the individual, coincidences that would be impossible to duplicate and numbers that cannot lie.<br />
<br />
This is what the TTA is talking about. If it's not God who is responsible for these things, then who is? The intentions to manipulate our actions and decisions, and be subject to do what their will draws us to do, is unethical. This we have previously agreed on.<br />
<br />
TT has got to play some role in this, the control and force it holds on people is not voiced enough. It has in the TTA.<br />
<br />
I challenge anyone to experience what I have experienced, and tell me you would not have done and felt the same. Endure the feelings of having your will taken hostage; to do what others will you to do, is the main concern why the TTA feels that TT is unethical.<br />

</div>Wow RMT, that's something else. I own the movie PI and seen it quite a few times, so I think I get the general idea.<br />
<br />
I know understanding the mechanical mathematical model and formula's maybe be hard &amp; boring for some, but since we are debating spirituality along with TT, and since the premise was also on spiritual advancement and the unethical use of TT leading us to this as a result, it may be a good idea to put them in more lay-men terms.<br />
<br />
Or meet us half-way  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> ?<br />

			You could say that, but I think you would be stretching the use of the term &quot;mathematical model&quot;. I can actually show people my REAL mathematical models (implemented on tools as simple as Excel and as complex as MATLAB/SIMULINK) that project my activities into the future.

</div>Great, I'd like to see them. However, if you have any objection to posting them on here, I can certainly understand. I know you've expressed some concern for keeping the rights to your story, I can only imagine how you may feel concerning your unique concepts. Perhaps you can just give us a standard watered done synopsis, or a common theory already out there as a basis to defend the notion I brought forth, of TT &amp; spiritual advancement.<br />

			â€¦Again, to me the proof is in the pudding. While you may call a certain, specific practice &quot;New Age&quot;, you really need to understand that approach in-depth to see if there is any scientific correlation or validation, because that is a major element which separates such an approach from the traditional &quot;religious fundamentalist&quot; approach where their only answer to a question is &quot;because God said so in this book...&quot;

</div>Ok, sounds fair enough. Let us look at some examples. Anyone want to post a list of the most popular New Age beliefs, and what they believe and how they approach the future?<br />
<br />
For example: Astrologyâ€¦ many of us know at least the Sun sign we were born under. I for one am an Aries, with a birthday from which many famous people have descended from. i.e. Buddha, William Wordsworth, Russell Crowe, Jackie Chan, and Jesus Christ also died on my DOB.<br />
<br />
Now, do I believe that any of this has any significance in the way I am? No of course not.<br />
<br />
Do the planets or Sun in a specific house this month, hold any power over my decisions and actions today?<br />
<br />
Is there any science or math to attest that they do control our mood and behaviors, to the characteristic traits that they claim those born under exhibit?<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

			I know the types you speak of, and yes they are out there. But you should be careful that you don't dismiss some approaches as being this without digging into their beliefs to see if they can be validated in any manner by science.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</div>Very well, let's validate some and see how they fit into the debate.<br />

			I've pointed you towards the concepts of the Meme, and also discussed things like Chaos Theory and fractals. These, and many other, elements of emerging science are changing the landscape of the two extremes I mentioned above (Science and Spirituality). The current work on Dark Energy is another one that is bringing these two disciplines together. If there is one overarching theme that these &quot;new sciences&quot; are coming closer to validating, it is the ancient spiritual/religious belief that &quot;we are all One... ALL in the universe is ONE.&quot; One can even analyze the universe systemically in this very manner.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Question for you RMT: Do these scientific notions you have brought up, do they offer any leads to a great design and designer?<br />
<br />
If we are all one, does this not also mean some Being set it all in motion with intention?<br />
<br />
Wouldn't these coincidences of 'oneness' show correlation to a consciousness once in control of all, but now dispersed in Space and Time at the inception of creation?<br />
<br />
Perhaps God is everywhere and in everything in this way. Wouldn't an energy of design still need to be kept around to maintain the structure of life?<br />
<br />
I know for some, the lights can be on, and no one can be home.<br />
<br />
Or does the universe simply need no governance?<br />
<br />
The TTA knows that no matter what I have done in the past, the synchronizations and manifestation was a form of a consciousness leading me towards a current crossroad of an action or decision. Again, whether it was God or a poser, the damage has been dealt, and my freewill was disregarded. This again, is WRONG!<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

			IMO, this would we a different debate. As the more we discuss spiritual traditions and &quot;who is right or wrong&quot;, then I think we are veering away from a discussion of whether we should develop (and regulate) the ability to TT.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I respectfully disagree, RMT. Since the premise was not just on human advancement, but also on spiritual advancement; the devolvement of TT, I am not sure if that was directly implied as the purpose for this debate. Therefore one may also take this debate as being a discussion on 'where we went wrong' and what was (or will be) our downfall to cause TT in the first place.<br />
<br />
Certainly the regulation and ramifications can be discussed as well.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			And that's a good thing. Similarly, on this board I focus on what I believe to be the &quot;unethical polluting of future potential&quot; with hoax TTers claiming we are heading for armageddon.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>And the TTA respects that. I remember when I was the only one like you here 6 yrs ago, with JT being one of the first and most influential of the hoaxers. While others were encouraging him and believing his story, I fought his views and attempted to debunk him.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			So again, with regard to this debate it would seem to me that you came in with a pretty strong &quot;it is wrong&quot; stance (when you consider other things you have written in the past) but now it seems you have conceded many of my points which may soften the &quot;it is wrong&quot; stance. Yet we both agree that &quot;it can be used in a wrong way for bad purposes.&quot;
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Well 6 yrs ago, and perhaps still today, the Ethic's of Time Travel wasn't much of a popular topic for TT discussion. I knew there was a middle ground back then though, that is why I was able to also state I wanted others to see both sides to what they were buying into.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			One hallmark of a well-structured debate is having a CLEAR statement of the debate's premise when going into it. Given our last few discussions on spirituality, I do not (yet) see a clear premise about it that we would debate. That is why I would suggest you work on defining some sort of CLEAR premise that would kick-off a new debate. That way we both know what the primary issue (truth or falseness thereof) is that we would be debating.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Ok, I'll give that some thought. Though I thought the premise was clear on this also being a spiritual advancement debate.<br />

			Something's in the background, the TTA along with countless others know this.

And this is why I ask for subjective evidence.  As the &quot;proponent&quot; of the statements that you used as the basis of this debate, I must ask you for evidence of your claim before we go on.

</div>You say this as if you are totally convinced (and you may well be) but at the same time you cannot provide objective evidence that TT *is* playing a role.  And so, it is nothing more than your hunch.  And this is also part of my point: UNTIL science can quantify exactly how TT manifests, and what IS and IS NOT possible by using this technology,  we cannot be sure that you are not just having bad dreams because of your choice of peppers in your salsa.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />

I know you've expressed some concern for keeping the rights to your story, I can only imagine how you may feel concerning your unique concepts.

Yet anyone who can plan-out and mathematically program a budget (in Excel or MSMoney) has one tool of many for being able to actively create the future they want to achieve. Isn't it amazing that I can project out into the FUTURE what my bank balances will be one month from now, one year from now, and even into RETIREMENT?  Yeah, not such a big deal, huh?  Yet this is one of a great many tools (some more complex than others) that ANY person can use to &quot;supercharge&quot; their free will to achieve anything they wish.I know this is going to sound corny... but it ain't rocket science!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

			Ok, sounds fair enough. Let us look at some examples. Anyone want to post a list of the most popular New Age beliefs, and what they believe and how they approach the future?<br />
<br />
For example: Astrologyâ€¦ many of us know at least the Sun sign we were born under. I for one am an Aries, with a birthday from which many famous people have descended from. i.e. Buddha, William Wordsworth, Russell Crowe, Jackie Chan, and Jesus Christ also died on my DOB.<br />
<br />
Now, do I believe that any of this has any significance in the way I am? No of course not.<br />
<br />
Do the planets or Sun in a specific house this month, hold any power over my decisions and actions today?<br />
<br />
Is there any science or math to attest that they do control our mood and behaviors, to the characteristic traits that they claim those born under exhibit?

</div>VERRRRY Interesting! So here we see you apparantly dismissing certain New Age philosophies (specifically, astrology) because it may not have any science/math to attest to its validity.  And yet this is exactly what I am pointing out to you about your claims of how TT has seemed to manifest to you... and how you felt totally controlled.  Where is the science/math to attest to your experience as anything more than astrology?   <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite5" alt=":confused:" title="Confused    :confused:" />

</div>It appears you enjoy asking new, and more varied questions of me.  However, you do not appear to be addressing the points I make to you about needing to back your subjective claims.  The fact is we don't know how TT can be achieved, and thus we do not know the rules of what can and cannot be done.  You think you already know this by your subjective experience.  But that does not constitute backing for your claim in this debate.So which is it?  Is this still a debate, or have we devolved to a conversation?<br />

			The TTA knows that no matter what I have done in the past, the synchronizations and manifestation was a form of a consciousness leading me towards a current crossroad of an action or decision. Again, whether it was God or a poser, the damage has been dealt, and my freewill was disregarded. This again, is WRONG!

			respectfully disagree, RMT. Since the premise was not just on human advancement, but also on spiritual advancement; the devolvement of TT, I am not sure if that was directly implied as the purpose for this debate. Therefore one may also take this debate as being a discussion on 'where we went wrong' and what was (or will be) our downfall to cause TT in the first place.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</div>Again: So is it a debate or a discussion?  Because if it is a debate I think we have to adhere to a rule where your claims need to be supported with evidence, rather than conjecture.

			Ok, I'll give that some thought. Though I thought the premise was clear on this also being a spiritual advancement debate.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>And I don't have a problem with that.  But if it is indeed a debate, I think we cannot go off on unsubstantiated tangents.  And a fundamental aspect of my rebuttal to you is that &quot;we have no objective evidence that TT is currently possible, nor what scientific impacts it has on our physical universe.&quot;That makes it difficult to debate both how ethics and spirituality relate to TT since we don't know the physical laws which will regulate TT (just like there are physical laws which regulate Force, Moment, Energy, and Information).<br />

</div>Yes, however take a look at the subject we are debating. It's a debate about whether Time Travel could be wrong for human/spiritual advancement. We can end it now based on the list of 4 points you made, making this a very limited debate:<br />

			1) We do not yet &quot;know&quot; enough about how TT may manifest to know what its impacts would be on the self or on the rest of the self's universe.<br />
<br />
2) Without this knowledge, we are also uninformed about how the technology (however it may manifest) could be used in a beneficial way or in an &quot;evil&quot; way.<br />
<br />
3) Because we lack this knowledge, the scientific method tells us it is &quot;good&quot; to investigate it and see what we might be capable of developing, for purposes of experimentation and acquiring the knowledge we lack in items 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
4) Until we do this, and understand under what circumstance (if any) causality can be violated, and what the eventual impacts of doing so are, I do not think we can pass ethical judgement on the technology or its potential uses.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</div>Or we can create a new one, that would look at the issues previously presented in the premise, and make it into a discussion.<br />
<br />
I only went along with the debate idea, because that's what you wanted to do. And it looks like we might have fulfilled that.<br />

</div>For you to objectively know anything anyone tells you what they are experiencing, you would have to experiences it along with them. So sure, let's bring 12 or more people face-to-face with these other people, and let them see the overwhelming force of these phenomena's control and judge for them selves what this is.<br />
<br />
Or we can always administer MRI's, EEG's &amp; EKG's, and see how this is happening, if it's a temporal induced anomaly or if it's an abnormal physiologic anomaly that's the cause.<br />
<br />
I think a simple experiment would be, if you take a person with this condition of synchronization, disorient them &amp; strip them of all electronics i.e. watches. And see over time how they are able to accurately point out to you that you would be looking at a double-digit number by asking you to verify by looking at your watch; or experiencing other manifestations (psychic visions, voices and know what your thinking), then this stops being a subjective experience, since others are now sharing in the experience.<br />

<br />
It's obvious I am not JT, though many could say, 'there are more connections then misses.' But the TTA knows about coincidences too. Whether they were subjective once, now you too have shared in my coincidences, and can clearly see what I am referring to.<br />

In the end, all you have is my word that they were beyond my control; I did not intent to make connections on purpose. And that again, is subjective in meaning.<br />
<br />
Unless I prove to many of you through some verifiable way that I am not part of Group Titor, what would your response be to how I was able to pull off all those connections?<br />
<br />
My answer would be:<br />
<br />
I am the TTA, what do you think I been saying for the past 6 yrs? You are being controlled, and TT is at the heart of it. If that one connection can be made, how many more do you think the TTA is capable of making?<br />

			I did not and never have agreed with you that it actually is going on right now. And this is why I ask for subjective evidence.

			You say this as if you are totally convinced (and you may well be) but at the same time you cannot provide objective evidence that TT *is* playing a role. And so, it is nothing more than your hunch. And this is also part of my point: UNTIL science can quantify exactly how TT manifests, and what IS and IS NOT possible by using this technology, we cannot be sure that you are not just having bad dreams because of your choice of peppers in your salsa.

I could share it, but it would mean nothing to you unless you had the background. Yet anyone who can plan-out and mathematically program a budget (in Excel or MSMoney) has one tool of many for being able to actively create the future they want to achieve. Isn't it amazing that I can project out into the FUTURE what my bank balances will be one month from now, one year from now, and even into RETIREMENT? Yeah, not such a big deal, huh?

			VERRRRY Interesting! So here we see you apparantly dismissing certain New Age philosophies (specifically, astrology) because it may not have any science/math to attest to its validity. And yet this is exactly what I am pointing out to you about your claims of how TT has seemed to manifest to you... and how you felt totally controlled. Where is the science/math to attest to your experience as anything more than astrology?

I believe my original question was to show how these NewAge notions approach the future, nothing more. And personally, I was not about to admit to being wise enough to be in the Buddha's shoes (did he even wear any?). That's the extent to which I dismissed this NewAge belief. Whether Astrology has any influence to humanity, is simply the question I asked.<br />
<br />
For verification to any of this, I believe many people who were born this month can read their horoscope, and let us know how right on it was.<br />

As for the science/math to these experiences. I have no doubt it will all be summarized in this format, someday.<br />

			Yes, however take a look at the subject we are debating. It's a debate about whether Time Travel could be wrong for human/spiritual advancement. We can end it now based on the list of 4 points you made, making this a very limited debate
		</div>

</div>You seem to have changed the premise of the debate along the way.  Yes, I think it is time we review the premise of the debate that you put forward, and where we have been with addressing these statements:

<br />
In reply to:<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1) Time Travel's impact on Spiritual &amp; Human advancement, go hand-in-hand.<br />
<br />
2) And that by use of Time Travel to obtain that advancement, is by an unethical means.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I have added the numbers to make it easy to reference them in the following:I believe I have established that #1 is not unique to time travel, and that it likely applies to virtually any technology advancement.  The example I gave was the Amish, and one can see how the development of several technologies (motors, telephones, etc.) impacted both their spiritual and human advancement.  Recall from the rules of logic that I only need to cite one example to show that your alleged uniqueness of time travel is untrue.  Furthermore, we cannot know if it DOES have a greater impact until we have quantified how TT can be possible within a universe that obeys certain scientific relationsips.<br />
<br />
The phrasing for premise #2 implies a global assertion.  IOW, it implies that this is ALWAYS true.  You did not use the words &quot;could be by unethical means.&quot;  So as in any debate, I was addressing your premise, as stated, not a modified premise.  You have agreed (and I assume modified your premise along the way) that use of TT may not ALWAYS be unethical, and therefore if there are cases where TT can be used ethically, one could find scenarios where it could possibly be used ethically for both spiritual and human advancement.  Furthermore, again I must point out that you have no hope of properly establishing objective support for these statements unless and until you can point to quantified laws for how TT can, and cannot, be used.  Just like Newton's law of F=ma restricts what we can do with bodies and forces, there will no doubt be limits on how TT can be used.<br />
<br />
Based on the above explanation for the premises you laid out, and how I addressed them, then I believe either the debate is over, or you are trying to change the premises.  If the latter is the case then certainly the original debtate is over because you have not been able to support these premises as they were originally stated.<br />
<br />

</div>I suggested a formal debate because this has long been a valid format for people to engage each other in discussions of what can be validated as true, and what is mere propaganda and unsubstantiated information.  As such, I hope you would agree that a debate does rely on being able to substantiate ones claims.  We can start another thread if you like, and discuss under any rules you wish.  However, you should know me well enough by now that I am not going to give you a &quot;free pass&quot; to use your subjective beliefs as some sort of &quot;evidence&quot; that TT is being used on you to subjugate your will.  As I have pointed out, and you have not addressed, the &quot;diagnosis&quot; for what you have experienced could have one of many other explanations.  You have simply fixed it in your mind that you &quot;know&quot; it was TT being used against you.  That is a subjective belief, not an objective fact.  Just like I could claim a subjective belief that aliens come and party with me every Friday night at my house (they are really lousy pool players).  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />

</div>No, I am afraid science adheres to a much higher standard than this, TTA.  Again I use the alien example with respect to UFOs:  If several (untrained) people observed what they THOUGHT were UFOs in the night sky over Phoenix, they certainly all experienced the same thing.  They could even convince themselves that they are CERTAIN they saw real UFOs.  Just because they convince themselves that this is what they experienced does not mean this is what actually happened.  An interesting side note: I happened to be in the Phoenix area on the evening I refer to (and I am sure many folks who listen to C2CAM know what I am referring to).  As it happens, I was doing some aircraft flight testings at Williams Air Force Base that is in Mesa, not far at all from where the pattern of descending lights was seen.  We were in the air at the time, and our flight crew pointed out the lights. We knew they were flares dropped from military aircraft just because we are all trained aviation observers.  When we looked at our computer navigation display in the cockpit we saw the aircraft that had dropped these flares on our air traffic display, and they were headed back to their home base at the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station.

</div>OK, so you are admitting you do not have evidence to support your claim right now.  Fine.  And you are even saying &quot;we can collect data in an attempt to show it&quot;.  Who gets to interpret that data in an effort to define what is going on? TTA?  Or perhaps specialists in neurobiology?  Just because we collect data does not mean your conclusion as to what is going on will be proven.  We need a scientific/mathematical theory that we can use to quantify the data AND possibly test predictions.  Not only would we need a quantified theory/model for how YOU think TT manifests in order to correlate the data, but we would also have to permit other, valid theories/models which also have a chance to explain what the data is telling us.

			I think a simple experiment would be, if you take a person with this condition of synchronization, disorient them &amp; strip them of all electronics i.e. watches. And see over time how they are able to accurately point out to you that you would be looking at a double-digit number by asking you to verify by looking at your watch; or experiencing other manifestations (psychic visions, voices and know what your thinking), then this stops being a subjective experience, since others are now sharing in the experience.

I find it interesting that here you are focusing on coincidences as meaning something important, but coincidences regarding you, your character, and the story of Group Titor are to be dismissed. So are you saying only &quot;some&quot; coincidences are to be attributed to a &quot;Big Brother&quot; who is manipulating you, while other coincidences mean nothing?<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ok, good point RMT. However, the mere fact that the TTA has always spoken out about coincidences, and now that this notion is shared objectively by many who believe I am JT, wouldn't this add credibility to what I have been saying about connections and coincidences all along?

</div>I asked you a question, yet you didn't answer it but instead asked a question of me.  I think if you answer my original question, you may have part of the answer to the question you posed to me.  i.e. if coincidences are a &quot;sign&quot; (and I am one who believes they are signs of something, perhaps not what you think they are signs of) then we must view all coincidences for the data they could deliver to us... and just becuase TTA dismisses some signs does not mean they are not relevant.

</div>Another scientific fallacy: You cannot prove a negative.  Unfalsifiability and plausible deniability have large parts to play in the whole Titor thing, and these would be perfect tools for a Group Titor to rely upon.  But before we go too far astray from this thread's topic, all of this is unfounded data... including &quot;coincidences&quot;.  So either we agree to use ALL coincidences or we agree they all mean nothing.  Can't have it both ways.

</div>That's fine, but my larger point in revealing the duplicity relates to how the TTA has often been noted to issue disparaging remarks about &quot;New Age&quot; (again, this is a tenuous umbrella term) philosophies.  Here, in this thread, you seem to have done this again with the point that currently there is no science/math to back them.  And I am only asking you to adhere to this same standard in your claims.

</div>Are you sure of this?  Be careful, because this would again lead you down a path of trying to prove a negative.

But I must tell you that even in a discussion, I will continue to point out that time-honored statement from systems engineering about what we know and do not know:&quot;You don't know what you don't know.

<br />
This will always entangle us in any discussion of both IF and HOW TT might be used for &quot;evil&quot; or for &quot;good&quot;.  If you ask me, this debate/discussion will always be ahead of its Time until we have equations (similar to Newton's and Einstein's) which tell us what is and is not possible with regard to TT.<br />

	</div>
</div>I changed the premise along the way? Yes, let's review how I did.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			I believe I have established that #1 is not unique to time travel, and that it likely applies to virtually any technology advancement. The example I gave was the Amish, and one can see how the development of several technologies (motors, telephones, etc.) impacted both their spiritual and human advancement. Recall from the rules of logic that I only need to cite one example to show that your alleged uniqueness of time travel is untrue. Furthermore, we cannot know if it DOES have a greater impact until we have quantified how TT can be possible within a universe that obeys certain scientific relationsips.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Yes, how appropriate. Though the premise did not change from this point on. And at best, the example you put forth was a generalization of the TTA's arguments in comparison to the Amish's stance on technology. Which was also shown to be false.<br />
<br />
The technology and the advancement was specific, the relevance to New Age doctrines vs. that of standard traditional beliefs was to be made. The TTA even went as far as to let you know what my approach to this debate would be.<br />
<br />
As for the unknown quantified impact, and how we could not go further in answering the debate in logical terms; if you knew this before hand and understood it's limits to answer more questions then there would be, why was a debate even considered with the TTA vs. just a discussion?<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			The phrasing for premise #2 implies a global assertion. IOW, it implies that this is ALWAYS true. You did not use the words &quot;could be by unethical means.&quot; So as in any debate, I was addressing your premise, as stated, not a modified premise. You have agreed (and I assume modified your premise along the way) that use of TT may not ALWAYS be unethical, and therefore if there are cases where TT can be used ethically, one could find scenarios where it could possibly be used ethically for both spiritual and human advancement. Furthermore, again I must point out that you have no hope of properly establishing objective support for these statements unless and until you can point to quantified laws for how TT can, and cannot, be used. Just like Newton's law of F=ma restricts what we can do with bodies and forces, there will no doubt be limits on how TT can be used.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>So this debate was a waste of time RMT. Really, you've asserted nothing new, but the obvious limits to seeing ethics in TT thus far.<br />
<br />
Yes, you assume, but the premise was never modified along the way; you however adding an exaggerated interpretation &amp; meaning to it not otherwise intended or reiterated by the TTA is the only change. If you wanted specifics and therefore made your own interpretation as result of not having any, you could have just asked.<br />
<br />
The factor we both could agree on was on the 'good' &amp; 'bad' uses of the technology. I believe the scenario was specific but limited to only this.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			Based on the above explanation for the premises you laid out, and how I addressed them, then I believe either the debate is over, or you are trying to change the premises. If the latter is the case then certainly the original debtate is over because you have not been able to support these premises as they were originally stated.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I am not trying to change anything RMT. Really, if anyone here is showing any effort regarding the interpretation of the premise is you. I merely wanted to continue on the spiritual advancement aspect of the premise and look at this comprehensively. But as we have seen, according to the logical terms, it's just not easily quantifiable.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

			I suggested a formal debate because this has long been a valid format for people to engage each other in discussions of what can be validated as true, and what is mere propaganda and unsubstantiated information.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Yes, but this place is only an Institute by name, not an actual university or place to have a formal debate. And as I have stated to you, that the TTA is not a scientifically based individual. Most of the time, one can't expect to have a formal debate with the common lay-man who doesn't know the rules of following a formal debate. You're an engineer for goodness sakes, and I believe you do your job right, so it's probably only a given that you'd be quite good at logical debates.<br />
<br />
But for everything else, there's discussions, meetings, PTA's. Not everything needs a formal format for discussion. And not every discussion needs to be taken to an extreme by experts. I believe some people reading over the posts of the TTI right now, may have ideas of their own that they wish to express, but may be intimidate if the forum is full of sharks, who are waiting for fresh meat to tear apart.<br />
<br />
This approach strikes me as very inhuman and radical. But we may disagree on this as well.<br />

			As I have pointed out, and you have not addressed, the &quot;diagnosis&quot; for what you have experienced could have one of many other explanations.

			No, I am afraid science adheres to a much higher standard than this, TTA. Again I use the alien example with respect to UFOs: If several (untrained) people observed what they THOUGHT were UFOs in the night sky over Phoenix, they certainly all experienced the same thing. They could even convince themselves that they are CERTAIN they saw real UFOs. Just because they convince themselves that this is what they experienced does not mean this is what actually happened. An interesting side note: I happened to be in the Phoenix area on the evening I refer to (and I am sure many folks who listen to C2CAM know what I am referring to). As it happens, I was doing some aircraft flight testings at Williams Air Force Base that is in Mesa, not far at all from where the pattern of descending lights was seen. We were in the air at the time, and our flight crew pointed out the lights. We knew they were flares dropped from military aircraft just because we are all trained aviation observers. When we looked at our computer navigation display in the cockpit we saw the aircraft that had dropped these flares on our air traffic display, and they were headed back to their home base at the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station.

If you do a simple experiment consisting of just a small group, you can vary it as many times as you'd like, attempt trial and errors tests and control tests.<br />
<br />
As for specifics, confirming the double-digit numbers, psychic visions &amp; voices is a sign to this manifestation, so it kind of goes without saying.<br />

			I asked you a question, yet you didn't answer it but instead asked a question of me. I think if you answer my original question, you may have part of the answer to the question you posed to me. i.e. if coincidences are a &quot;sign&quot; (and I am one who believes they are signs of something, perhaps not what you think they are signs of) then we must view all coincidences for the data they could deliver to us... and just becuase TTA dismisses some signs does not mean they are not relevant.

</div>The TTA asked you a question that answered your question, confirming it in an obvious manner. If my only option was to get a small soft drink and I knew it, and you asked me anyway's and I said; 'what size do you think I want?' What do you think the obvious answer would be?<br />
<br />
Yes, your suggestion works in reverse too, but refusing the obvious example first posed to you by the TTA in a question is simply more convenient, and much easier to follow then the one you engineered.<br />

			In your mind this may be true. Yet in the minds of others (God knows how many) we can at least say that there is no hard-fast objective evidence that either positively indicts you nor positively clears you on this issue. Yet there are an awful lot of coincidences... especially as they relate to your love of double-digits.

			Another scientific fallacy: You cannot prove a negative. Unfalsifiability and plausible deniability have large parts to play in the whole Titor thing, and these would be perfect tools for a Group Titor to rely upon. But before we go too far astray from this thread's topic, all of this is unfounded data... including &quot;coincidences&quot;. So either we agree to use ALL coincidences or we agree they all mean nothing. Can't have it both ways.

</div>Who said I would be using denials as a means to prove it. I have no problem with showing all coincidences; I merely stated that I can prove one of them objectively. How this goes with not being able to 'unfalsifiability' show anything, I disagree. I can easily drive over to any one's home within a 50 mile radius and prove that I cannot be Titor. What then?

I see a lot of energy expended by the TTA (both here/now as well as here/then) to try to convince people of what you believe.

However, if anyone is attempting to prove to anyone anything what they believe, it's you RMT. They can plainly tell you that they are not part of Group Titor again and again, and you can keep on insisting in a harassing &quot;scientific&quot; manner that they are.<br />

			That's fine, but my larger point in revealing the duplicity relates to how the TTA has often been noted to issue disparaging remarks about &quot;New Age&quot; (again, this is a tenuous umbrella term) philosophies. Here, in this thread, you seem to have done this again with the point that currently there is no science/math to back them. And I am only asking you to adhere to this same standard in your claims. That is all.

</div>So you agree or disagree that New Agisms don't offer math? I acknowledged Chaos Math for example, and stated that I own the movie PI, didn't I?<br />
<br />
As for stating disparaging remarks about New Agisms, I believe you stated you knew the types I was referring to.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, adhering to the same standards in my claims? My claims are not following any New Agisms, but opposed to them for this very purpose for freewill subjugation. My agenda has always been about humanity and allowing them to see the possible pit falls and where we could go wrong by these means of unification that they preach. This will not justify their actions in the past. That's all I'm saying!<br />

			Since we are showing the cards each of us will be playing with, I concur. The good and bad of the technology will be the main focus for this debate. However, my angle will not so much be on the 'doom &amp; gloom' of the future that you may be accustomed to debating &amp; debunking with others. But more on a system of unity, and justifications for spiritual salvation, and it's ramifications on the soul by use of this technology.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>This technology is not limited to TT, but to New Agisms as well. Can anything good come out of it? Well LRH tech can be good in small quantities, but some of it's policies and practices, not always good. Wouldn't you agree?<br />
<br />
This is the distinction the TTA wanted to make about New Agisms, that they could have the potential to disregard the human component, for the sake of addressing their end results. i.e. greater consciousness &amp; awareness attainment, spiritual enlightenment. That's all fine and dandy, but their policy on how to deal with the rest of humanity that doesn't quite share in their approach, is unacceptable to a minority (in comparison to the future's culture). And their attempts to subjugate mankind to follow in place to find their patterns of truth to spiritual discovery, is not by our choice, but by their time table.<br />
<br />
This again, is the concern the TTA has regarding TT, New Agisms &amp; Alien abductions. It's exploitation and manipulation of a race that should have every right to choice regarding their own future, not to be assisted or coerced by others through these means.<br />
<br />
You stated your self; you don't like other shoving their beliefs down your throat.<br />
<br />
And for the record, the TTA is not either, but offering a 2nd view, an alternative to an approach that will eventually offer no way out, or at least a difficult severing.<br />

			Are you sure of this? Be careful, because this would again lead you down a path of trying to prove a negative.

			Thanks. But I must tell you that even in a discussion, I will continue to point out that time-honored statement from systems engineering about what we know and do not know:<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't know what you don't know. And not knowing what you don't know is a serious impediment to you knowing whether what you are doing is 'right'.&quot;<br />
<br />
This will always entangle us in any discussion of both IF and HOW TT might be used for &quot;evil&quot; or for &quot;good&quot;. If you ask me, this debate/discussion will always be ahead of its Time until we have equations (similar to Newton's and Einstein's) which tell us what is and is not possible with regard to TT.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>With that said, I agree and believe this concludes the debate.<br />
<br />
And since the TTA stated that this would be my last thread, and since I see no further reason to continue in a discussion given that we can both go on like this for as long as it takes, I see no reason to even go on with the discussion.<br />
<br />
One can later look back on this thread and see that this idea was attempted to be debated and discussed. And if New Agisms truly offer any threat against humanity and open a gateway to TT someday as the TTA believes it will, I suppose this debate can then continue on with our ascendants to offer scientific evidence and mathematical models in discussion and debate.<br />
<br />
At this time, I would appreciate if some of you could please take the TTA's exist survey.<br />
<br />
<b>Would you like to see the TTA stay on the TTI forum and continue to post?</b><br />
<br />
Yes - I would like to have the TTA remain and offer his unique insights on TT and other subjects.<br />
<br />
Alternative Yes - I'd like to see the old Classic TTA post again.<br />
<br />
Maybe - I don't mind, as long as he can remain civil.<br />
<br />
No - I do not want the TTA to stay, he should remain banned, his past behavior is unforgivable.<br />
<br />
Thank-you,<br />

Well,<br />
<br />
It looks like Rainman has shown that your &quot;material&quot; is as subjective and irrevelant now as it was back when.  What is really surprising to me is how close you have shown yourself to be to Creedo's claims on abduction and the &quot;voices&quot; he hears.  Your views on the double-digits are about as new age as it gets.  You have a very selective value system and, to me, you are a very &quot;queer&quot; duck.  I see absolutely no change in you (contrary to your claims).  You are still attacking people in rude ways, yet you say you have mellowed out.  I could almost see you licking your chops, thinking that you had weaseled your way back on TTI.  It didn't take long to show your colors.<br />
<br />
Since you claim that you are &quot;exiting&quot;, I don't really expect a retort to this little statement.  If there is anyone who would appeal to the &quot;weaker minds&quot; here, it is you who have the intent to do so.  Just in the short time you have been here, I have seen more proxy IP addresses than all year, and I am more than just a little suspicious (Annie?) that you are trying to weave a few deeper levels of deceit.  You had your chance Javier and you blew it big time.  Any further attempt will only make the hole you are digging even deeper.  This is not to say that you are not clever.  Serial rapists and murderers are clever too.  So are pedophiles.  From the beginning I have sensed something &quot;evil&quot; about your actions, and you have said and done nothing to dissuade my original conclusions about you.  I am not alone in this.  Take the lesson that the Apostle Paul had to learn the hard way.  Stop &quot;kicking against the pricks&quot;.  Rainman is one of the most patient people I have ever known and he went the extra mile to &quot;prick&quot; your understanding and conscience.  You reacted in your typical negative way.  Unfortunately, this is not years ago--this is now--and everything has changed.  You've shown that you cannot change--even though you said that you have.  I don't think you have any question as to how I voted in your little poll.  Don't let the door kick you in the ... on the way out.</div>

Hey Bob, it's always nice hear your personal renditions to the TTA's posts. It spans across the ages.<br />
<br />

</div>No, not necessarily irrelevant, but subjective for now perhaps.<br />

			What is really surprising to me is how close you have shown yourself to be to Creedo's claims on abduction and the &quot;voices&quot; he hears. Your views on the double-digits are about as new age as it gets. You have a very selective value system and, to me, you are a very &quot;queer&quot; duck. I see absolutely no change in you (contrary to your claims). You are still attacking people in rude ways, yet you say you have mellowed out.

</div>Bob, please spare us another one of your attempts to even perceive to think you understand the TTA. You never could. All you could ever do was attack me, simply because I was offering a 2nd perspective to NewAgisms. I know you took this pretty personal back then, and even now.<br />
<br />

</div>You would like to believe this, and you can, I don't care what you personally believe in Bob. Obviously you're still the same vulture that gained my trust and respect as sonofbabylon, to only attack me as another user that same week.<br />

</div>I believe the saying goes: 'He who say's it, is it.'<br />
<br />
Look at your own self Bob, your posts have the classic look of someone who's intent to spread their own Ivory Tower idealism to everyone. You can feel sad and sorry for anyone who doesn't share in your views, you take a smug and content approach to describe the very texture of someone's soul, but you are not any more above &amp; consciously enhanced then a mere bully is.<br />
<br />
And this notions upsets you. I believe we have all seen how double faced you can be when you get angry and upset.<br />

</div>Seriously Bob, for someone such as your self who claims to be so spiritual, I find your approach to be quite reprehensible. Obviously RMT is much smatter then the TTA, I recognize that and have humbly acknowledged his skill. He's got many more years of study then I do. However, that doesn't make everything I say wrong, just because I can't offer him a scientific/math explanation, no more then you would be able to if you approached a man such as Jack Sarfatti.<br />

</div>You are truly an evil force to be reckoned with Bob, you still need anger management. Don't forget your mask; you need it when you're discussing consciousness enhancements and other NewAgisms to those who yet don't know your evil approach. But like I said to RMT before, anyone can go back to read the posts, and determine the quality of our characters. I have accepted mine, how about you?<br />

<br />
All of this Time-travel stuff.<br />
<br />
Humanoids, I will be happy to discuss this ethical or unethical branch of:<br />
<br />
Da-da:<br />
<br />
Civilization (of some species called -- Humanoids!)<br />
<br />
But, perhaps talking about the ethics of time-travel as it concerns -- da-da -- Humanoids, can not totally be done, without knowing that there are certain limits, which is afterall -- done with laws, and also -- is against --- free will!<br />
<br />
But, before subjugating the rest of the Universe to Humanoid Free-Will, as it is, perhaps other species will have to be included on the discussion:<br />
<br />
You know your favorite (humor) --- John Titor -- the Civilization of the Future.<br />
<br />
And now, the Civilizations of perhaps -- other species -- other than Humanoids (who have already lost their free-will, time-travel, and many other things -- perhaps only to gain them back in the future.)<br />
<br />
<a href="http://http/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.serpo.org/</a><br />
<br />
Ah, but is there any humanoid that we may not have included as of yet, or may develop some Heartfelt Technology in the future off of said human:<br />
<br />
Don't forget Dr. Heim.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Humanoids only claim what they claim is -- free will.<br />
<br />
Humanoids only claim what they claim is -- time travel.<br />
<br />
Humanoids only claim what they claim is -- a Civilization.<br />
<br />
Humanoids only claim what they claim is -- religion.<br />
<br />
Humaniods only claim what they claim is -- the truth.<br />
<br />
Humanoids only claim what they claim are - falsehoods.<br />
<br />
Humanoids only claim what they claim about -- a great many things.<br />
<br />
This slanted viewpoint may not last -- though -- only as long as the Humanoid Species still have a few humanoids alive -- all of child-bearing age, and also a female and a male. (Genetics!)<br />
<br />
Thus, there is &quot;structure&quot; to this time-travel. (Needed to convince others whomever and whereever they are at -- that Humanoids have Developed 'thinking' in some form.)<br />
<br />
And it is not all lost, anyway. Never was. Still is around.<br />
<br />
The rest is Imagination and Godzilla!<br />

</div>That's a good point Darby, but isnt it amazing how coincidental that you were also present around the same time as Javier and Pamela and at a time when this forum was new and on top of Googles search list, and around a time when all other time travel forums were becoming popular.  The idea comes to me that you guys were attempting to bring interest and popularity to this forum and what better way then to create a fictitious character and claim him to be a time traveller, &quot;the first one of his kind&quot;.  Whoo haa, that makes perfect sense now!!<br />

			Whatever the effect, moral, ethical or legal, that time travel would have it would be an expensive venture for a society in time, manpower, resources and money. Surely such a society would have a better plan than the theme that we've seen - &quot;I'm here from 2035 (2025, 2036, etc.); the world is doomed; everything that could prove me true is a secret and I can't answer any tough questions.&quot;

</div>Not necessarily, information (over vast distances or through space and time) might be able to be sent for relatively cheep with little if no investment at all, in fact it just might be effortless.  You probably noticed that people actually like doomsday action as it keeps their attention.  When you start saying hoopla like, 'the world is doomed', readers become like scared animals that huddle together.  That's were you rodeo clowns looped them in. Hey I wonder what sociology book Javier got the idea that allowed him to grasp what it is that controls large masses of people?<br />

Well there we have it, Darby places himself among the clan from 6 years ago and professes that Javier made him.

As usual Javier all you have submitted is idle talk.  You have not submitted any clear evidence other than HOOEY from the horses end!!<br />
<br />
Have you smelled yourself lately, because I hate to break it to ya, but you aint smelling like a rose!! more like po' LOL, being that you associate yourself so much with those po' people!!<br />
<br />
If my recollection serves me correctly, there has been quite a few people over the years (both here at TTI, Anomalies and others) that didn't and still don't see eye to eye with your character or your idiotic views!!  I cant imagine why? LOL, maybe you're a yokel after all!!<br />
<br />
I would have to agree with Zerubbabel in all his aspects about you, and one of them being that it has been out of the ordinary that (out of the blue, upon your return and accusal of being Titor) that an awful lot of cloaked IP address have surfaces straggling to keep the John Titor story alive.  You certainly aren't running out of coincidences are you dude?<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

			Just in the short time you have been here, I have seen more proxy IP addresses than all year, and I am more than just a little suspicious (Annie?) that you are trying to weave a few deeper levels of deceit. You had your chance Javier and you blew it big time. Any further attempt will only make the hole you are digging even deeper.<br />

</div>LOL Javier, an entertainment lawyer aint gonna cut it!!  But hot dam man, if you want to talk about WHO'S THREATENING anyone, ditto dude!!  Let see, I seem to recall that several people over the years have been threatened by the John Titor hoax (people that have gotten to close to figuring out who he was).  And by THREATS I mean threatening phone calls, letter messages, e-mails and inbox messages sent to them all in the order of something commandeering you would do.  I read all about D'em THREATS on Darby and Rick's Anomalies forum. But after reading some of Zerubbabel's posts, LOL, I see you &quot;had admitted&quot; to phone pranking Creedo with threats and was involved with a fourteen-year-old nymphet!!  Man, you're guilty as all hell, I'd say thou art more deep damned than Prince Lucifer!!<br />
<br />
As far as D'em voices you are clamoring about, LOL what a bunch of HOKUM!!  I would say you're just mess'n with us, feeding off of our DOUBTS, SUSPICIONS and UNCERTAINTIES that these time manipulations, voices and numbers are happening to the psyche, (just like those sociology books you read, teach all about).<br />

Quite the flair for drama, eh TTA?  While I have attempted to refrain from my usual sarcasm (yes, I may have slipped once or twice), I see your Modus Operandi emerging right on schedule:<br />

</div>Problem is you really don't know the details of the comparison I was making, because you immediately avoided engaging me on that comparision.  And instead you issued your OWN generalization about the Amish... something about not using the technology &quot;period&quot;.  I then gave you references to counter YOUR generalization and show you that you really don't know the Amish as well as you may think.  And now we come full-circle with TTA's tactics in that the TTA is accusing ME of throwing generalizations!  Classical TTA if ever I have seen it.

Just because we collect data does not mean your conclusion as to what is going on will be proven. We need a scientific/mathematical theory that we can use to quantify the data AND possibly test predictions. Not only would we need a quantified theory/model for how YOU think TT manifests in order to correlate the data, but we would also have to permit other, valid theories/models which also have a chance to explain what the data is telling us.<br />

</div> What's with the &quot;let's&quot;?  Let us?  Part of the reason I started the debate was because I thought you had some kind of CONVINCING evidence to support your claims.  Yet now you are trying to enlist my help to look for such evidence, when really I was just hoping to evaluate it.  If you can afford me, then perhaps I might be willing to take on the job.  It might be fun, but the RainmanTime is not into charity work that he does not believe is for a worthy cause.

</div>Science (good science) is not just about choosing what is on the shelf.  You accuse me of using a bad analogy above, and yet this one is quite a bit worse.  If the premise which is trying to be scientifically verified REQUIRES a large soft drink, then guess what? The experiment cannot be executed (nor data collected) until all the REQUIREMENTS are satisfied.  To do anything less would invalidate the experimental data.

</div>Interesting.  So what part of my quote above did you interpret as being &quot;not nice&quot;? Quite honestly, I could have really pulled out some &quot;Classic RMT&quot; that would have been much less nice.  However, the first statement above is my SUGGESTION to you, and it is an earnest one especially given the TTA's admission to not being a very scientific individual.  The second statement is just my opinion, based on the &quot;data&quot; I have seen so far.  You want to interpret this as &quot;not being nice&quot; then it is YOU, the interpreter, who has the problem, for I had no ill INTENTION when I used those words.  It would seem the TTA has fiarly thin skin if he is offended by the above comments.

THREE varying choices for how people can vote to allow you to stay, and only one cut-throat way for them to vote you off the island.  Why not just two choice: (A)Should he stay? or (B)Should he go?<br />

Simplicity avoids people always having suspicions about intentions.  BTW, I haven't voted as yet, but I will inform you when I do (if you wish).<br />

I personally don't care that you and him are paranoid about other people logging on to the TTI using cloaked IP addresses.<br />
<br />
Both of you can support each other, cheer &amp; shout and lick your chops, and gang up together to attack the TTA.<br />
<br />
For the way I see it, I'd be more suspicious of those who condone these hateful radical actions, and at the end of the day still claim to be spiritual. There is no greater hypocrisy to the cause of spiritual &amp; consciousness obtainment then by being an @#$ hole, IMHO.<br />

Let see, I seem to recall that several people over the years have been threatened by the John Titor hoax (people that have gotten to close to figuring out who he was). And by THREATS I mean threatening phone calls, letter messages, e-mails and inbox messages sent to them all in the order of something commandeering you would do. I read all about D'em THREATS on Darby and Rick's Anomalies forum. But after reading some of Zerubbabel's posts, LOL, I see you &quot;had admitted&quot; to phone pranking Creedo with threats and was involved with a fourteen-year-old nymphet!!

Furthermore, Bob can believe whatever twisted fantasy he wants to believe about the TTA, and accuse me of whatever with anyone. He doesn't know me, and neither do you.

			â€¦.They are not AS strict as you might imply with your &quot;period&quot; statement. In fact, their &quot;hard-fast&quot; rule is that THEY are not permitted to OWN or operate any of these certain technologies. For example, an Amish person would never own an automobile. But do you think they have a rule of never being allowed to ride in them? (Their rule: &quot;No one shall operate cars or trucks.&quot;). This does not prohibit an Amish member from riding in someone else's car, especially in the case of an injury of one of their community. They are not going to tell a city ambulance &quot;no, you cannot take them away to the hospital in that ambulence.&quot; There are other examples, so this is just to give you the flavor.

<br />
But really, you don't need to engineer me a lengthy condescending reason why you won't.<br />
<br />
A simple 'no thank-you' would have sufficed.<br />
<br />
No need for *#&amp;$ waving.<br />

			Science (good science) is not just about choosing what is on the shelf. You accuse me of using a bad analogy above, and yet this one is quite a bit worse. If the premise which is trying to be scientifically verified REQUIRES a large soft drink, then guess what? The experiment cannot be executed (nor data collected) until all the REQUIREMENTS are satisfied. To do anything less would invalidate the experimental data.

</div>I'll leave it to you to find an accusation, where there isn't one.<br />
<br />
As for the analogy: A large soft drink is not part of the requirement for the experiment in the analogy, but simply to show the relentless desire of the experimenter for what he believes he needs to complete the experiment, not necessarily significant to the conclusion. i.e. smaller group, smaller facility, smaller budget.<br />

			No, really it cannot go without saying. And your &quot;specifics&quot; are hardly specific. What PRECISELY do you mean by &quot;confirming the double-digit numbers&quot;?
