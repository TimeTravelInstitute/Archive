<br />
Forget about all you heard from your Bible's Story of Creation!<br />
<br />
Extrapolations from Zacheria Sitchin's Lost Book of Enki: Memoirs and<br />
Prophesies of an Extraterrestrial God<br />
Sasha Lessin, Ph.D. <a href="mailto:sashalessinphd@...">sashalessinphd@...</a><br />
<br />
Six thousand years ago, astronaut/pioneers from the planet<br />
Nibiru dictated Enuma elish--the Creation Epic--to the Sumerians. The<br />
Creation Epic says our Sun, a solitary star at this time in its<br />
history(1), first created a planet the Nibirans called Tiamat. Tiamat<br />
was the proto-Earth. It orbited Sun counterclockwise.<br />
<br />
Next, the Sun, called Apsu, created Mercury and propelled<br />
Mercury with water and gold to Tiamat. Venus and Mars, Jupiter and<br />
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune formed as pairs and orbited the Sun<br />
counterclockwise too. Tiamat lacked a partner-planet, but one of her<br />
moons, Kingu, enlarged. Kingu was about to become Tiamat's partner<br />
planet and orbit the Sun, rather than Tiamat.<br />
<br />
But, four billion years ago, before Kingu could attain<br />
planetary orbit around the sun, Nibiru entered the Solar System<br />
clockwise and split off a piece of Neptune. That chunk of Neptune<br />
became its moon, Triton. Triton, unlike other moons in the System,<br />
orbits Neptune clockwise. As Nibiru passed through the Solar System,<br />
it lost three moons, tore four moons from Uranus and tilted Uranus'<br />
orbit. Then Nibiru ripped eleven moons from Tiamat and pulled Gaga,<br />
Saturn's largest moon, into clockwise orbit (between Neptune and<br />
Uranus) where Gaga is now Pluto.<br />
<br />
Some of Nibiru's moons hit Tiamat, creating the Pacific Basin<br />
in what was left of Tiamat. That intact remainder of Tiamat is Earth.<br />
In the Pacific, waters and life-seeds of Nibiru and Tiamat evolved<br />
together. The shards of Tiamat (from the Pacific gouge Nibiru's moon<br />
made) are Asteroids and comets. Nibiru's gravity took all Tiamat's<br />
moons but Kingu. Nibiru's invasion left Kingu lifelessly orbiting<br />
Earth. Tiamat's other moons became satellites of Nibiru.<br />
<br />
Nibiru stabilized into a clockwise orbit (equal to 3,600<br />
orbits of Earth around the Sun).<br />
<br />
In the Creation Epic, the Sumerians knew and wrote of an<br />
advanced civilization on a planet in a different solar system. They<br />
had the concept of a pulsar, the star around which Nibiru had orbited<br />
before that star collapsed. The Niburan astronauts, the Lords, had<br />
their Sumerian scribes write--only lately being confirmed by our<br />
scientists--of the composition and movement of the astronomical<br />
bodies of Solaris' system. The Lords told the Sumerians that there<br />
was water on asteroids, comets, Neptune, Uranus, Venus, Mars, Saturn,<br />
Jupiter, also on the rings of Saturn and Saturn's and Jupiter's moons<br />
as well. Our astronomers recently confirmed what the Lords dictated.<br />
The Sumerian Creation Epic lends compelling evidence for the<br />
extraterrestrial settlement of Earth by Nibirans, the human<br />
astronauts who came to be regarded as the gods of Earth.<br />
<br />
Millennia passed after Nibiru and the solar system achieved<br />
relative orbital stability around the Solaris. Life on Nibiru<br />
evolved, culminated in technologically-sophisticated, long-lived homo<br />
sapiens, the humans of Nibiru. Nibirans unified, after disastrous<br />
thermonuclear wars, under a single kingship. But Nibiru was losing<br />
its atmosphere, critical to heat regulation and survival.<br />
<br />
500,000 years ago, King Lahma vacillated over how to deal<br />
with the escaping atmosphere. Should he nuke the volcanoes to<br />
regenerate the atmosphere? Or should he send miners to Solaris'<br />
Asteroids, where probes registered gold which could be powdered and<br />
spread as a shield for Nibiru's atmosphere?<br />
<br />
Prince Alalu, exasperated by Lahmu's inaction and desperate<br />
to save Nibiru, pushed Lahma off a tower.<br />
<br />
Lahma's heir, Anu, agreed at first to Alalu's rule. Alalu<br />
and Anu sealed their alliance when Anu's firstborn son, Ea/Enki<br />
(whose autobiography, compiled by Sitchin, is the principal authority<br />
for our tale), married Dimkina, Alalu's Daughter.<br />
<br />
Ea related how Anu had earlier denied him his bride-to-be,<br />
his (Ea's) half-sister Ninmah, when she bore the child of their half-<br />
brother, Enlil. Anu simultaneously honored Ea and proclaimed fealty<br />
to Alalu by offering a compromise successor to the houses of both<br />
Alalu and Anu via the child Dimkina and Ea will create, the baby<br />
Marduk.<br />
<br />
Alalu nuked the volcanoes, but this failed to re-establish<br />
Nibiru's atmosphere. He also failed to get gold for an atmospheric<br />
shield from the Asteroids; en route, the rocket of goldminers he sent<br />
crashed without survivors. For nine more Nibiran years (nine orbits<br />
of Nibiru around Solarisâ€“32, 400 Earth years), Alalu's rule gave no<br />
relief from atmospheric degredation.<br />
<br />
Anu, rightful king by Nibiran tradition, challenged<br />
Alalu. &quot;Anu gave battle to Alalu. To hand-to-hand combat, with bodies<br />
naked, Alalu he challenged. Alalu in combat was defeated; by acclaim<br />
Anu was hailed as king.&quot; (Sitchin, Lost Book of Enki pages 24 - 39)<br />
<br />
Alalu stole a missile-armed rocket and blasted from Nibiru to<br />
Earth. From Earth, he controlled the gold Nibiru needed to survive.<br />
He positioned his nukes to blast Nibiru on its next pass by Earth.<br />
Alalu dangled gold as a carrot and menaced missiles as a stick. To<br />
Anu on Nibiru he beamed, &quot;On another world I am, the gold of<br />
salvation I have found. The fate of Nibiru is in my hands. To my<br />
conditions you must give heed!&quot; [Sitchin, Lost Book of Enki page 60]<br />
<br />
&quot;Return my throne,&quot; Alalu demanded. But Anu's Foremost Son,<br />
Enlil, demanded proof of gold on Earth. So Alalu documented his<br />
proof and transmitted it to the home planet. Enlil distrusted the<br />
proof. He asked Anu to convene the Nibiru Council. In the Council,<br />
Enlil and the counselors implored Anu to keep his kingship.<br />
<br />
The scientist Ea, Firstborn Son of Anu, addressed the<br />
Council. Although Ea was Anu's Firstborn Son, Ea was second in<br />
succession to Anu's throne. The first to succeed Anu was Enlil, the<br />
Foremost Son. Enlil was first in succession because his mother,<br />
Anu's Royal Spouse, Antu, was Anu's half-sister. This made Enlil, not<br />
Ea, Anu's Foremost Son by Nibiru succession rules.<br />
<br />
Ea, however, though only Firstbornâ€“not Foremost--Son, married<br />
Damkina, Alalu's Daughter. As Alalu's son-in-law as well as Anu's<br />
Firstborn, Ea could be an acceptable go-between for both Anu and<br />
Alalu. Thus all in the Council listened intently to Ea address the<br />
threat and promise Alalu was offering them..<br />
<br />
Ea proposed that he, in person, verify gold on Earth. If<br />
there's gold there, Ea said, let Alalu be Earth's King. If the gold<br />
saves Nibiru's atmosphere, Anu and Alalu can wrestle for kingship of<br />
Nibiru. &quot;Let me in a chariot [rocket] to Earth journey, a path<br />
through the Bracelet [Asteroids] with water, not fire [Alalu had used<br />
nuclear missiles to get through the Asteroids] I shall fashion. On<br />
Earth, from the waters let me the precious gold to obtain; to Nibiru<br />
back it will be sent.&quot; [op.cit: 66] Anu endorsed Ea's plan and sent<br />
him with pilot Anzu and fifty male astronauts to Earth. Enlil<br />
seethed with frustration that Ea pre-empted the heroic mission to<br />
Earth.<br />
<br />
Ea, rocketing to Earth in his spaceship, used up his water<br />
supplyâ€“needed for the propulsion sysem--blasting Asteroids in his<br />
way. He landed on Mars to draw water from a lake, then rocketed for<br />
Earth, &quot;its gold Nibiru's fate for salvation or doom containing.&quot;<br />
[op.cit., 71] The astronauts splashed into the Persian Gulf; there<br />
Alalu guided them ashore.<br />
<br />
Ea built a settlement, Eridu, at the head of the Persian<br />
Gulf. From the Gulf, he extracted some gold. He built a plane, and<br />
with his personal pilot, Abgal, tested for more gold all over the<br />
planet.<br />
<br />
Anu beamed orders from Nibiru to Earth. He commanded Ea to<br />
send Alalu's ship back to Nibiru with as much gold as possible. In<br />
Alalu's rocket, Ea and Abgal found seven nuclear missiles. They hid<br />
the nukes in a cave.<br />
<br />
Anzu, the interplanetary pilot, came to ready Alalu's rocket<br />
to return to Nibiru. But when he saw the missiles gone from the ship,<br />
Anzu confronted Ea. &quot;When we flew to Earth, we used only water<br />
cannon to blast through the Astroids and we almost killed our engine<br />
because our water was wasted blowing rocks out of our way. So I need<br />
the nukes you took from this ship to get through the Asteroids back<br />
to Nibiru.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ea retorted, &quot;Foresworn is the weapons' use.&quot; [SItichin, Z.,<br />
2002, The Lost Book of Enki, page 82]. &quot;In view of your attitude,<br />
I'm replacing you as pilot; you stay here on Earth. Abgal, my<br />
personal pilot, will take Alalu's ship back to Nibiru. And he'll do<br />
it with water cannon only. I said no nukes and I mean it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ea programmed a return route through the Asteroids and Abgal<br />
flew the spacecraft to Nibiru with sample gold to test as an<br />
atmospheric shield there.<br />
<br />
On Nibiru, scientists processed the gold &quot;to make of it the<br />
finest dust, to skyward launch it was hauled away. A Shar [one orbit<br />
of Nibiru around the Sun, equal to 3,600 Earth years; Nibiruans live<br />
so long they seem immortal by our standards] did the fashioning last,<br />
a Shar did the testing continue. With rockets was the dust heavenward<br />
carried, by crystals' beams was it dispersed. [But] when Nibiru near<br />
the Sun came, the golden dust was by its rays disturbed; the healing<br />
in the atmosphere was dwindled, the breach to bigness returned.&quot;<br />
[Sitchin, Z., Lost Book of Enki, page 86] Anu sent Abgal back to<br />
Earth for more gold.<br />
<br />
On Earth again, Abgal found only a small gold yield, all Ea<br />
could mine from the Gulf so far. Ea sent Abgal to Nibiru again with<br />
this disappointing yield of gold. Prospecting, Ea found gold, huge<br />
veins of it, in southeast Africa (Abzu). Jubilant, he announced his<br />
find to Nibiru.<br />
<br />
Back on Nibiru, Anu and Enlil received Ea's news of vast<br />
veins of gold. Enlil, angry still that brother Ea leads the Earth<br />
Mission, demanded proof, not just of gold, but of lots of gold. &quot;Ea<br />
already gave false hope that enough gold could come from Earth's<br />
waters to save Nibiru's atmosphere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anu, unhappy with Enlil's constant complaints about Ea, gave<br />
in. &quot;Enlil, I'm sending you to Earth; there, you'll be in charge.<br />
Check on Ea's find.<br />
<br />
When Enlil made landfall on Earth, he beamed back that,<br />
despite his initial doubts, Earth probably had gold enough to save<br />
Nibiru's atmosphere.<br />
<br />
But the basic rivalry between Ea and Enlil (that plagues<br />
Earth to this day) surfaced again.*<br />
<br />
&quot;Father Anu,&quot; Enlil broadcast from Earth to Nibiru, &quot;Affirm,<br />
by the law of succession, that I, your son by your own half-sister<br />
Antu, precedes and has authority over Ea, though, he, your eldest<br />
son, be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come,&quot; Enlil implored, &quot;to Earth in person and deal with<br />
Alalu, too, who thinks he's king here and says he should rule Nibiru<br />
as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, 416, 000 years ago, Anu flew to Earth and drew lots with<br />
Ea and Enlil. At the drawing, Anu decreed, one lot would bestow rule<br />
over Nibiru; another lot would give its holder rule of Earth and<br />
control the Persian Gulf headquarters; the last lot would give<br />
responsibility for African mining operations and sea transport .<br />
<br />
&quot;By their lots the tasks they divided; Anu to Nibiru to<br />
return, its ruler on the throne to remain. The Edin [Mesopotamia] to<br />
Enlil was allotted, to be Lord of Command, more settlements to<br />
establish, of the skyships and their heros charge to take. Of all the<br />
lands until they the bar of the seas encounter, the leader to be. To<br />
Ea the seas and the oceans as his domain were granted, lands beyond<br />
the bar of the waters by him to be governed, in the Abzu<br />
[southeastern Africa] to be the master, with ingenuity the gold to<br />
procure.'&quot; [Sitchin, Z., Lost Book of Enki, pages 92 -93]<br />
<br />
Enlil's first act was to award Enki his initial settlement,<br />
Eridu, on the Persian Gulf, in perpetuity.<br />
<br />
No sooner did Anu and his sons divide rule of Nibiru and<br />
Earth, than &quot;Forward toward Anu Alalu stepped, shouted, `Mastery of<br />
Earth to me was allotted; that was the promise when the gold finds to<br />
Nibiru I announced! Nor have I the claim to Nibiru's throne<br />
forsaken.'&quot; [op.cit. 93] Anu wrestled Alalu. &quot;Anu on the chest of<br />
Alalu with his foot pressed down, victory in the wrestling thereby<br />
declaring, `I am King'&quot;<br />
<br />
But when Anu lifted his foot from Alalu, &quot;swiftly he the<br />
manhood of Anu bit off, the malehood of Anu Alalu did swallow.!&quot;<br />
[op.cit.94] Enlil tied Alalu up while Ea gave Anu first-aid. Alalu,<br />
Anu groaned, will slowly die from his seed.<br />
<br />
Anu condemned Alalu to spend his last days on Mars. Anu, on<br />
his return trip to Nibiru, dropped Alalu on Mars, with food and<br />
tools. Anu also left Alalu's kinsman, Anzu--the interplanetary pilot<br />
Ea had discharged, to care for Alalu as he died on Mars.<br />
<br />
When Anu arrived back on Nibiru, he told the Council his<br />
plans for gold hunting through the solar system. He ordered<br />
continuous freight rockets to and from Earth. &quot;Rockets will shuttle<br />
among way-stations on Mars, Earth's Moon, other planets and<br />
satellites between Nibiru and the sun.<br />
<br />
NINMAH, ENROUTE TO EARTH, SAVES ANZU ON MARS, STARTS MARSBASE<br />
<br />
&quot;King Anu sent his daughter Ninmah with female health<br />
officers to Earth. &quot;Stop,&quot; said the King, &quot;on the way, at Mars. If<br />
Anzu lives, give him men to set up a base there.&quot;<br />
<br />
On Mars Ninmah found Alalu and Anzu dead. It was too late<br />
for the condemned Alalu, but Ninmah revived Anzu.<br />
To commemorate Alalu who discovered the gold that can save Nibiru,<br />
Ninmah and Anzu,&quot;The image of Alalu upon the great rock mountain with<br />
beams they carved&quot; [Sitchin, Z., The Lost Book of Enki, page 104].<br />
<br />
Ninmah gave Anzu twenty of the astronauts from her company<br />
and ordered him to build the first way station for the gold<br />
freighters.<br />
<br />
EA, NINMAH &amp; ENLIL<br />
<br />
Let us pause in the narrative of Ninmah's journey to Mars and<br />
Earth to explicate her relationship to her half-brothers, Ea/Enki and<br />
Enlil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enki and Enlil and Ninmah...Offspring of Anu the three<br />
leaders were, by different mothers. Enki was the Firstborn Son; a<br />
concubine of Anu's was his mother. Enlil by Antu, the spouse of Anu,<br />
was born; the Legal Heir he thus became. Ninmah by another concubine<br />
was mothered, a half sister of the two half brothers she<br />
was....Greatly beautiful she was, full of wisdom, one quick to learn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ea, as Enki was then named, by Anu to espouse Ninmah was<br />
chosen, thereby their offspring son the legal successor thereafter to<br />
become. Ninmah of Enlil, a dashing commander, was enamored; by him<br />
she was seduced.... &quot; [SItichin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki,<br />
pages 112-113] Ea dictates to his scribe. (The rivalry between Ea<br />
and Enlil--the critical competition that still affects Earth, shows<br />
here, as Ea refers to the sexual connection between his fianc Ninmah<br />
and their half-brother, Commander Enlil, as &quot;seduction.&quot;)<br />
<br />
&quot;A son from Enlil's seed Ninmah bore, Ninurta.... Anu<br />
angered; as punishment he Ninmah ever to be a spouse forbade! Ea his<br />
bride-to-be by Anu's decree abandoned; a princess named Damkina<br />
[Alalu's daughter] he instead espoused; a son, an heir to them was<br />
born, Marduk.&quot; [Sitichin, 2002, op. cit.]<br />
<br />
Ea continues, &quot;A son from Enlil's seed Ninmah bore,<br />
Ninurta.... Anu angered; as punishment he Ninmah ever to be a spouse<br />
forbade! Ea his bride-to-be by Anu's decree abandoned; a princess<br />
named Damkina [Alalu's daughter] he instead espoused; a son, an heir<br />
to them was born, Marduk.&quot; [Sitichin, 2002, op. cit.] Through his<br />
mother, Marduk carries the heritage of Alalu: a propensity to strive<br />
endlessly for dominance.<br />
<br />
We return from our genealogical segue to Ninmah's journey to<br />
Earth. We left her on Mars.<br />
<br />
Ninmah and Anzu finished Alalu's monument on Mars [The faceâ€“<br />
Alalu's--NASA photographed, then denied]; she rocketed on to Earth.<br />
<br />
As soon as she made planetfall on Earth, Nimmah showed Enlil<br />
and Ea seeds she brought. She tells them the seeds will bear a fruit<br />
from which a &quot;euphoric elixer&quot; can be made.<br />
<br />
Enlil lured Ninmah into his airplane and flies her to his<br />
house &quot;by the Cedar Forest&quot; [Lebanon], as a perfect place to plant<br />
her seeds. &quot;Once inside, Enlil embraced her, with fervor he kissed<br />
Ninmah, 'Oh my sister, my beloved!' Enlil to her whispered. By her<br />
loins he grabbed her.&quot; But &quot;Into her womb his semen he did not pour.&quot;<br />
[op.cit., 108] Though he promised her a healing city and said he'll<br />
bring their son Ninurta to Earth, she remained sexually aloof from<br />
Enki.<br />
<br />
Hurt when Ninmah's rejected him sexually, Enki mooned about<br />
his gardens. He watched Sud, Ninmah's gorgeous Assistant Health<br />
Officer who'd been assigned to landing platform there in Lebanon,<br />
bathing in his stream with the other young women from the medical<br />
team. Enlil invited Sud to get high on elixir made from seeds Ninmah<br />
brought from Nibiru and planted in his garden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sud drank, Enlil drank too; to her Enlil of intercourse was<br />
speaking. Unwilling was the lass....Enlil laughed and embraced her,<br />
kissed her. His semen into her womb he poured.<br />
<br />
To Ninmah, Sud's commander, the immoral deed was reported.<br />
Enlil, immoral one. For your deed judgement you shall face. So did<br />
Ninmah to Enlil in anger say. In the presence of fifty Anunnaki<br />
Seven Who Judge were assembled. On Enlil a punishment decreed: Let<br />
Enlil from all cities be banished...Let him exiled be. In a<br />
skychamber they made Enlil leave the Landing Place [Lebanon]; Abgal<br />
was his pilot.&quot; [SItichin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki, pages 113-<br />
114]<br />
<br />
Abgal, remember, was the pilot Ea had promoted from airplane<br />
pilot to rocket pilot Abgal'd helped Enki hide Alalu's nuclear<br />
missiles.<br />
<br />
ENLIL BANISHED FOR RAPE; ABGAL BETRAYS ENIK, SHOWS ENLIL ALALU'S NUKES<br />
<br />
Abgal takes Enlil to exile in Africa but shows him the nukes'<br />
cave there. Abgal says, &quot;Take the weapons into your possession, with<br />
the weapons your freedom obtain!&quot; [op. cit., 114]<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sud's pregnant from Enlil's rape. Enki and the<br />
tribunal ask Sud if she'd marry Enlil if she were his official<br />
spouse. She agrees to marry Enlil as his royal wife. So the<br />
tribunal and even Ninmah pardon Enlil and he and Sud marry. Sud's<br />
given the title Ninti and bears Nannar/Sin, the first Nibiran Royal<br />
born on Earth.<br />
<br />
Enki tells Ninmah, &quot;Come with me in the Abzu ... your<br />
adoration of Enlil abandon.&quot; In Africa, &quot;Enki there to her words of<br />
loving spoke, sweet words he spoke, 'You are still my beloved' to her<br />
he said, caressing. He embraced her, he kissed her, she caused his<br />
phallus to water. Enki his semen into the womb of Ninmah poured.<br />
Give me a son' he cried.&quot; [op. cit., 115]<br />
<br />
But she bears him a daughter, then, immediately, another<br />
daughter. When he insists on another pregnancy &quot;Ninmah against Enki<br />
a curse uttered, whatever food he ate was poison in his innards....<br />
To distance himself from Nimmah's vulva Enki by raised arm swore;<br />
from her curse Enki was freed. To the Edin Ninmah returned.&quot; [op.<br />
cit., 116]<br />
<br />
ENLIL &amp; ENKI BREED COMPETING LINEAGES WITHIN ANU'S CLAN<br />
<br />
Enki's Lineage: Enki sent to Nibiru for his wife, Damkina,<br />
and their son, MARDUK. With them, and with the children Damkina<br />
bore him on Earth, Enki built his clan--Marduk's earthborn half-<br />
brothers--NERGAL, GIBIL, NINGISHZIDDA/THOTH and DIMUZI--and their<br />
progeny.<br />
<br />
Enki's eldest son, Marduk, recall, was grandson of Alalu.<br />
When Alalu seized the Nibiran Throne he bestowed his daughter,<br />
Damkina, on Anu's son Enki/Ea. The first son of Damkina and Ea was<br />
Marduk. Marduk, Anu and Alalu had at the time agreed, would one day<br />
reign as King of Nibiru. So Marduk, the son of Enki and Damkina, was<br />
supposed to be the heir to the Nibiran throne. But Anu deposed and<br />
condemned Alalu, sent Enki and Enki's siblings, Ninma and Enlil to<br />
Earth.<br />
<br />
On Earth, Enki and Enlil bred lineages. Powerful groups of<br />
kin who competed for power in Operation Gold Dust.<br />
<br />
Enlil bred his clan on Earth with his wife, Sud/Ninti. Their<br />
sons together-- NANNAR/SIN and ISHKUR/ADAD/TESHUB--reinforced him and<br />
his eldest son, NINURTA (Enlil's illicit child with Ninmah) in their<br />
struggles with the Enkiites.<br />
<br />
By some 400,000 years ago, Enlil had established seven<br />
Mission Centers (Sippar the Spaceport; Nippur, Mission Control;<br />
Badtibira, Metalurgical Center; Shurrupak, Med Center).<br />
<br />
Anzu commanded 300 Nibirans on Mars Base and in the shuttle<br />
service. His men, the Igigi, rocketed gold from Mesopotamia, where<br />
Enki's ships brought it from Africa. Anzu's men on Mars transferred<br />
the gold to spaceships bound for Nibiru. On Nibiru, scientists<br />
powdered the gold and seeded it into the air. &quot;Slowly was the breach<br />
in the heavens healing.&quot; [op. cit., 117]<br />
<br />
The Igigi, led by Anzu, demanded Enlil grant them better<br />
working conditions, more elixer from the fruit Ninmah grew and a rest<br />
facility on Earth. Anu beamed orders from Nibiru for Anzu to go to<br />
Enlil on Earth where Enlil will show Anzu the entire mining operation<br />
so he'd understand why the Igigi must persevere.<br />
<br />
When Anzu arrived at Nippur, Enil's Capitol, he found<br />
Commander Enlil reluctant to cooperate. Enlil's reluctance to<br />
receive Anzu reflected the challenge the Igigi's demands and<br />
especially the leadership of Anzu, kinsman to the executed Alalu.<br />
Enlil insisted he, not Anzu gave orders to the Astronauts. Enlil<br />
believed that he alone had authority over the entire Earth operation;<br />
Anzu and the astronauts should obey, not challenge him.<br />
<br />
Ea, however, persuaded Enlil to go ahead and explain the gold<br />
mining, refining and transport system to Anzu. &quot;Our father, King<br />
Anu,&quot; said Enki, &quot;says to convince Anzu to keep his men on the job.&quot;<br />
So Enlil admitted Anzu to his chambers.<br />
<br />
But when Enlil took off his clothes and set down the key to<br />
his control room, Anzu purloined the key. Anzu then snuck in the<br />
control room and stole the computer crystals that ran the spaceport<br />
and the astronaut cities in Mesopotamia. He forced Ea's pilot Abgal<br />
to take him to the spaceport, Shu.ru.pak. There, Anzu's men declared<br />
him king of Earth and Mars. He shut down vital services at<br />
headquarters (Nibru-ki) and cut communication between Earth and<br />
Nibiru.<br />
<br />
Ninurta (Enlil and Ninmah's son) shot Anzu down in an<br />
spectacular air battle. Ninurta then freed Abgal, captured Anzu and<br />
retrieved the crystals.<br />
<br />
The Seven Who Judge--Ea/Enki, Damkina/Ninki, Marduk/Ra,<br />
Nannar/Sin, Enlil/Yawheh, Ninmah and Ninurta--ordered Anzu<br />
executed &quot;with a killing ray.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marduk, however, sympathized with the Igigi complaint that<br />
made them revoltâ€“no R&amp;R facilities on Earth, infrequent rotations<br />
back to Nibiru, little elixer. &quot;OK, Marduk,&quot; Enlil commanded, &quot;Go to<br />
Mars and take command of the astronauts; do what you must so they<br />
obey me unconditionally. On Mars, bury Anzu, improve conditions and<br />
boost morale among the Igigi.&quot;<br />
<br />
NINURTA SUPERCEDES NANNAR AS ENLIL'S SUCCESSOR ON EARTH<br />
<br />
Sitchin, in The 12th Planet [pages 107 -116] had earlier said<br />
the role of Anzu in The Lost Book of Enki's account of the revolt of<br />
the Igigi [pages 117 - 121] was actually the role of Nannar, Enlil's<br />
Legal Heir (Enlil's first son by his legal spouse), as part of his<br />
(Nannar's) dynastic challenge to Ninurta (Enlil's Firstborn) for<br />
Command of Earth. Perhaps Nannar was the power behind Anzu. Nannar<br />
was exiled from Ur, not executed. Nonetheless, after Enlil's son<br />
Ninurta defeated the Igigi and executed their leader, Anzu, all the<br />
Nibiran leaders--including Nannar,--pledged to honor Ninurta as<br />
Enlil's successor on Earth.<br />
<br />
Before, Ninurta was Enlil's successor only on Nibiru; Enlil's<br />
successor on Earth had been Nannar, his son with Ninmah. Ninurta,<br />
now Enlil's &quot;Foremost Warrior,&quot; enforced Enlil's rule over the<br />
entire system of gold extraction, processing, and transportation to<br />
the Nibiru. To make sure Ninurta's obeyed, Enlil gave him the IB<br />
missile, &quot;a weapon with fifty killing heads.&quot; [Sitchin, 1985, The<br />
Wars of Gods and Men, page 102]<br />
<br />
ENKI RESPONDS TO MINERS' MUTINY, GRAFTS NIBIRAN &amp; HOMO ERECTUS GENES<br />
TO MAKE PRIMITIVE WORKERS<br />
<br />
300,000 years ago, Earth's climate warms dramatically.<br />
<br />
In Africa, Enki leaves mines to Foreman Ennugi and goes<br />
North, to what's now Zimbabwe, Enki and Ningizidda set up a lab for<br />
Earth Studies, especially homo erectus, a species Enki identifies as<br />
destined to evolve in a few million years into homo sapiens sapiens,<br />
the species of the Nibirans. Apemen fascinate Enki, with their<br />
intelligence, but also for their compassion for other animals, which<br />
they free from Enki's traps.<br />
<br />
Back at the African goldmining center, miners complained that<br />
Ennugi worked them too hard. Ennugi radioed Enki, who sympathized<br />
with the miners. He secretly coached them to entrap Commander Enlil<br />
and manipulate him to accept a plan he had for the apemen.<br />
<br />
First, the miners drastically reduced their shipments of gold<br />
to Ninurta in Badtibira. Enlil sends Ninurta to investigate.<br />
Ninurta and Ennugi hear miner-complaints. &quot;They were backbiting and<br />
lamenting, in the excavations they were grumbling. Unbearable is the<br />
toil.&quot; Enki, sympathizes with the miners and tells Ninurta to invite<br />
Enlil to the mines and see how the miners suffer.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Enlil and his Visier, Nusku, arrive, &quot;'Let us unnerve<br />
Enlil'...mine-working heros shouted. 'Of the heavy work let him<br />
relieve us. Let us proclaim war, with hostilities let us gain<br />
relief.' To their tools they set fire, fire to their axes they<br />
put.&quot; They hold Mine Boss Ennugi hostage and, with tools as torches,<br />
surround the house Enlil occupies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Enlil radios Anu to shuttle to Earth and execute the miners'<br />
leaders and their instigator (implying Enki). Anu arrives in Africa<br />
and conducts an inquiry. But no miner reveals leaders or<br />
instigator. Anu also sympathizes with the miners, so Ninurta<br />
requests new miners from Nibiru and wants better equipment.<br />
<br />
Enki tells Ningishzidda, &quot;Let us create a Lulu, a primitive<br />
worker, the hardship to take over, let the Being the toil of the<br />
Anunnaki [astronaut-pioneers] carry on his back.... The Being that we<br />
need, it already exists. All that we have to do is put on it the<br />
mark of our essence [ie, our genes], thereby a Lulu, a Primitive<br />
Worker shall be created! [The Lost Book of Enki, pages 124 -127]<br />
<br />
Enki, Earth's Lord, showed the apemen to Enlil, Earth's<br />
Commander and Ninurta, Enlil's Foremost Warrior,<br />
says, &quot;Ningishziddha, my son, their fashioning essence [DNA<br />
structure] has tested; akin to ours it is, like two serpents it is<br />
entwined. When with our life essence shall be combined, our mark<br />
upon them shall be, a Primitive Worker shall be created. Our<br />
commands will he understand. Our tools he will handle, the toil in<br />
the excavations he shall perform, to the Anunnaki in the Abuzu<br />
[Africa] relief shall come.&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of<br />
Enki, page 130]<br />
<br />
Enlil objected to Enki's plan. 'Don't create a<br />
Nibiran/Apeman slave class here on Earth,' Enlil reminded Enki, &quot;On<br />
our planet [Nibiru], slavery has long ago been abolished, tools are<br />
slaves, not other beings.&quot; [Sitchin, ibid.] Ninurta added that to<br />
get gold better, Enki should make tools, not slaves. Enki<br />
repied, 'Earthlings we'll create'll be &quot;helpers,&quot; not slaves.'<br />
<br />
Enlil still protested: hybrid cloning was forbidden in<br />
the &quot;Rules Of Planet To Planet Journeying&quot; Enki's response 'the<br />
team won't create a new species; Erectus is our the genetic<br />
ancestor. He evolves into us--Homo Sapiens, Sapiens--the humans of<br />
Nibiru; we'll just speed him along a few million years.' *<br />
<br />
The brother rivals, Enki and Enlil, beamed their dispute to<br />
Anu and the Council on Nibiru. Each brother had his say on whether<br />
Enki's team should develop hybrid workers. Anu and the council<br />
ruled, &quot;Gold must be obtained. Let the Being be fashioned! The<br />
Council decided....Forsake the Rules of Planetary Journeys, let<br />
Nibiru be saved.&quot; [Sitchin, op. cit., page 132]<br />
<br />
Enki and Ningishzidda had intercourse with apewomen, When no<br />
pregnancies followed, Enki and Ningishzidda used their seed to<br />
fertilize apewoman ova in test tubes and surgically implant the<br />
resultant zygotes in apewomen. But the hybrid babies born of the<br />
apewomen lacked vision, hand dexterity or internal functioning.<br />
Ninmah overcame some of the deficiencies when she added copper and<br />
clay of Earth to the hybrid zygotes' lab environment.<br />
<br />
Nimah and Enki created test-tube zygotes for primitive worker<br />
experiments [Sitchin, Z., The 12th Planet, page 352]. Even with her<br />
improvements, the resulting Earthling lacked speech capacity.<br />
<br />
Enki implanted a test-tube-grown zygote formed from his<br />
sperm and an apewoman ovum in Ninmah's womb, rather than the womb of<br />
an apewoman, to see if the baby Ninmah bore would speak. &quot;In the<br />
clay vessel the admixture they made, the oval of an Earth female with<br />
Anunnaki male essence they put together. The fertilized egg into the<br />
womb of Ninmah by Enki was inserted. There was conception. To a<br />
male child Ninmah birth was giving. Enki the boy child held in his<br />
hands, the image of perfection was he. He slapped the newborn on his<br />
hindparts; the newborn uttered proper sounds. &quot; He could speak. &quot;He<br />
handed the newborn to Ninmah. 'My hands have made it!' victoriously<br />
she shouted.&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki, pages 138 -<br />
139.]<br />
<br />
THE HYBRID ASTRONAUT/ERECTUS MALE HAS FORESKIN, WHICH THE ASTRONAUTS<br />
LACK<br />
<br />
The baby, Adamu [One Who Like Earth's Clay Is], looked like a<br />
dark red blood-colored, black-haired Nibiru child in every way except<br />
his penis. &quot;They looked at its malehood; odd was its shape, by a<br />
skin was its forepart surrounded, unlike that of Anunnaki malehood it<br />
was. 'Let the Earthling from us Anunnaki by this foreskin be<br />
distinguished.' So was Enki saying.&quot; [Sitchin, op. cit. page 139]<br />
<br />
Once she had Adamu, the prototype for the primitive worker,<br />
Ninmah sent for seven women from her Medical Corps in Shurubak to be<br />
womb-mothers to Adamu's clones. &quot;'His essence alone as a mold shall<br />
be!,' so was Enki saying.&quot; [Sitchin, op. cit. page 141] Ninmah<br />
assembled her volunteers, prepared the zygotes and pledged unity with<br />
the Earthlings they'dl create.<br />
&quot;In seven vessels of the clay of Abzu made, Ninmah ovals of the two-<br />
legged females placed. The life essences of Adamu she extracted bit<br />
by bit in the vessels she it inserted. Then in the malepart of Adamu<br />
an incision she made, a drop of blood to let out. 'Let this a Sign<br />
of Life be; that Flesh and Soul have combined let it forever<br />
proclaim.' She squeezed the malepart for blood, one drop in each<br />
vessel to the admixture she added. 'In this clay's admixture,<br />
Earthling with Anunnaki shall be bound. To a unity shall the two<br />
essences, one of Heaven, one of Earth, together be brought.' In the<br />
wombs of the birth-giving heroines the fertilized ovals were<br />
inserted.&quot; [Sitchin, ibid.]<br />
<br />
To duplicate Adamu, Ninmah implanted test-tube hybrid<br />
zygotes from Erectus eggs fertilized by Nibiran sperm in the wombs of<br />
seven female astronauts from Ninmah's Medical Corps. All the<br />
resultant seven hybrids were male.<br />
<br />
Ningishzidda created a zygoteâ€“Nibiran Ovum fertilized by<br />
Erectus sperm--to develop into a female hybrid who could breed. He<br />
implanted this zygote in Ninti, Enki's spouse. The hybrid Ninti bore<br />
and delivered by caesarian, was female, Ti-Amat [Mother of Life], a<br />
sandy-blonde.<br />
<br />
Ningishizzida cloned Ti-Amat's essence into seven test-tube<br />
zygotes and implanted them in the same Med Corps women who bore the<br />
hybrid males. All of the surrogate mothers carried female hybrids,<br />
again delivered by caesarian. Enki put the seven female and the<br />
eight male hybrids together. The hybrids copulated frequently, but<br />
the females didn't conceive.<br />
<br />
Ninmah objected. &quot;Surrogacy to create hybrids is too hard on<br />
my Med Officers, and can't, in any case, make enough hybrids to work<br />
the mines.<br />
<br />
The astronauts laboring in the mines and the gold shuttle<br />
staff threatened mutiny if Enki and Ningishziddha fail to deliver<br />
enough of the promised workers to relieve them of manual labor.<br />
Under this pressure, Ningishziddha conducted research at Ninmah's<br />
Medical Center in Shurubak.<br />
<br />
Ningishziddha compared the genetic structure of breeding<br />
Nibirans and those of Adamu and Ti-Amat and found the genes in the<br />
Nibiran genotype that allowed reproduction. Nibiran females had a<br />
recessive XY chomomsomal allele in their genotype whereas Ti-Amat had<br />
only XX.<br />
<br />
Ningishzidda anesthetized Enki, Ninmah and Ti-Amat.<br />
Then &quot;from the rib of Enki the life essence he extracted; into the<br />
rib of Adamu the life essence he inserted. From the rib of Ninmah<br />
the life essence he extracted; into the rib of Ti-Amat the life<br />
essence he inserted. He proudly declared, 'To their Tree of Life two<br />
branches have been added, with procreating powers their life essences<br />
are now entwined.'&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki, page<br />
148]<br />
<br />
Enki, Ninmah and Ningishziddha kept their alteration of Ti-<br />
Amat secret and let her and Adamu wander in Enki's orchard in the<br />
Edin, the mouth of the Persian Gulf, while she gestated. Ti-Amat<br />
maked leaf-aprons for herself and Adamu.<br />
<br />
ENLIL EXPELS ADAMU &amp; TI-AMAT FROM EDEN TO AFRICA<br />
<br />
<br />
Enlil noticed the aprons and demanded explanation. Enki<br />
confessed; Enlil was enraged. &quot;The last bit of our life essence to<br />
these creatures you have given, to be like us in procreation knowing,<br />
perchance our [millions of years] life cycles on them to<br />
bestow.&quot; &quot;My lord Enlil,&quot; Ningishziddha was saying, &quot;knowing for<br />
procreation they were given, the branch of Long Living, to their<br />
essence tree was not.&quot; &quot;Then let them be where they are needed,&quot;<br />
Enlil with anger said. &quot;To the Abzu [Africa] away from the Edin, let<br />
them be expelled.&quot; [Sitchin, op. cit. page 149]<br />
<br />
Sitchin writes that Enki's genetic team was speeding up<br />
hominid evolution that would have occurred anyway. &quot;Modern man would<br />
have undoubtedly evolved on Earth just as he had done on Nibiru, both<br />
having come from the same 'seed of life.' &quot; Enki and company sped<br />
our evolution by one to fortty million years. [Genesis Revisited,<br />
pages 165 -166]<br />
<br />
ENKI BEGATS HIGHER EARTHLING HYBRIDS ON EARTHLING SLAVE GIRLS<br />
<br />
Hybrid Earthling slaves proliferated Enki's Africa and, as<br />
their numbers grew, were re-introduced to Mesopotamia, there to labor<br />
for the Nibiran lords.<br />
<br />
But the hybrids also foraged for food all over Mesopotamia<br />
and created food shortages for their lords. To alleviate the<br />
shortages they caused, Enki planned to uplevel the Earthlings'<br />
intelligence. With enhanced intelligence, Earthlings could tend<br />
plants and domestic animals.<br />
<br />
In his African reserve, Enki impregnated two beautiful young<br />
hybrid Earthlings. Both women conceived. One bore a boy whom Enki<br />
named Adapa. The other Earthling bore a girl he called Titi. Enki<br />
hid the fact that he fathered Adapa and Titi.<br />
Adapa and Titi mated; Titi bore twins, Ka-in and Abael.<br />
<br />
Enki raised Adapa, educating him as the son he was (albeit<br />
clandestine). Enki taught Adapa plantation, herd and estate<br />
management. Then Enki brought more Earthlings from Africa to<br />
Mesopotamia and had Adapa train them to serve the Nibiran<br />
colonists.<br />
<br />
Adapa became &quot;a busybody, in charge of the services for which<br />
the primitive workers were brought over to the Edin; he supervised<br />
the bakers, assures water supplies, oversees the fishing for Eridu<br />
[Enki's estate on the Persian Gulf] and tends offerings&quot; [Sitchin,<br />
Z., 1995, Divine Encounters, page 51].<br />
<br />
Adapa begged Enki to give him the substances of Nibiru to<br />
allow him, like the Nibirans, to live for hundreds of thousands of<br />
years.<br />
<br />
Enki used a device similar to the U.S.'s HAARP laser<br />
batteries to halt the wind that blows up the Gulf from the South so<br />
Adapa could, on a south-sailing vessel, voyage secretly down the<br />
Persian Gulf.<br />
<br />
Tales of Adapa's brilliance had already reached King Anu on<br />
Nibiru. When he heard that Enki manipulated Gulf weather to send<br />
Adapa on his mysterious voyage, Anu sent his vizier Ilabrat to Earth<br />
to fetch Adapa to Nibiru.<br />
<br />
Complying, Enki also sent his two unmarried Earth-born sons,<br />
Ningishzidda and Dumuzi with Adapa to Nibiru to meet their<br />
grandfather, King Anu, and perhaps find Nibiran brides.<br />
<br />
On Niburu, Anu questioned Adapa about the craft and the<br />
mission he'd been on when Enki halted the Gulf wind back on Earth.<br />
Ningishzidda, who'd taken DNA samples from Adapa and knew Adapa must<br />
be his nephew, the son of Enki, slipped Grandfather Anu a sealed<br />
tablet from Enki. In the tablet, Enki confessed fathering Adapa and<br />
Titi with Earthling hybrids and asked Anu to send Adapa back to Earth<br />
to generate more hybrids, to father more Civilized Man.<br />
<br />
Enki's tablet asked Anu to deny Adapa food or elixirâ€“the<br />
Bread of Life and the Water of Lifeâ€“that would make Adapa and his<br />
progeny immortal. The Earthlings, an unprecedented new civilized<br />
species were, Anu realized, his genetic descendents via his son Enki;<br />
denying them immortality would keep them quarantined on Earth a long<br />
time.<br />
<br />
DUMUZU STAYS ON NIBIRU TO LEARN HUSBANDRY, NINGISHZIDDA<br />
RETURNS TO EARTH WITH ADAPA &amp; SEEDS<br />
<br />
King Anu gave Ningishzidda grain seeds for Earth and told him<br />
to take the seeds and Adapa back to Earth. The King told<br />
Ningishzidda to become Adapa's tutor and work with Enki. &quot;You and<br />
Enki, Ningishzidda, shall be the teachers of Civilized Man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anu ordered Dumuzi to stay on Nibiru and learn domestic<br />
animal husbandry till Nibiru next approached Earth (in one shar--<br />
3,600 years). When Nibiru neared the Inner Solar System again,<br />
Dumuzi would return to Earth with female goats and sheep and a sperm<br />
bank for them. [Sitchin, Z., 1995, Divine Encounters, pages 49 - 65;<br />
2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 173 -174]<br />
<br />
KAI-IN AND ABAEL<br />
<br />
Marduk, Enki's eldest son, took charge of Abael and his<br />
animal husbandry project; livestock was to be a project of the Enki<br />
lineage. Ninurta, Enlil's eldest son and foremost warrior, tutored<br />
Ka-in in farming. Agriculture was to be a project of the Enlil<br />
lineage.<br />
<br />
Dumuzi brought to Earth grain seeds for Ninurta and Ka-in,<br />
one of the twins of Adapa and Titi, to develop. Dumuzi also brought<br />
female sheep and goats as well as the &quot;essence seeds&quot; for these<br />
animals for Marduk and Ka-in's twin Abael to nurture.<br />
<br />
At a &quot;Celebration for Firsts,&quot; Ka-in, guided by Ninurta,<br />
presented a sample of his first grain. Abael, guided by Marduk,<br />
presented his first lambs to Enlil and to Enki. Though Enki was both<br />
maternal and paternal grandfather of twins Ka-in and Abael, he made<br />
much of Abael's offering and the meat and wool that would soon be<br />
available, but says nothing of Ka-in's offering of grain, for Ka-in<br />
has been co-opted by Ninurta. Ka-in became sullen. &quot;By the lack of<br />
Enki's blessing greatly was he aggrieved&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins quarreled for an entire winter about whose<br />
contributionâ€“Ka-in's grains and fish-abundant canals or Abael's meat<br />
and wool--contributed most. &quot;When summer began, it was not raining,<br />
the meadows were dry, the pastures dwindled. Into the fields of his<br />
brother Abael his flocks drove, from the furrows and canals to drink<br />
water. By this Ka-in was angered.&quot; The twins fought with fists till<br />
Ka-in blugeoned Abael with a stone, then sat and sobbed. [Sitchin,<br />
Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki, page 183- 184].<br />
<br />
KA-IN'S LINE<br />
<br />
Enki brought his grandson, Ka-in, to Eridu to be judged by<br />
The Seven Who Judge (Enlil, Ninki, Ninurta and Nannar from the Enki<br />
Lineage, Ninmah, and Enki, Ninti and Marduk from the Enki Lineage).<br />
Marduk, Abael's mentor, demanded the Judges order Ka-in, protege of<br />
his rival Ninurta, executed. But Marduk's father Enki revealed he,<br />
Enki, was Ka-in's grandfather, so Ka-in is Marduk's grandnephew.<br />
Enki told Marduk that Ka-in's survival was critical to generate<br />
genetically superior Earthling laborers for field, pasture and<br />
mines &quot;If Ka-in too shall be extinguished, satiation [of food<br />
supplies] to an end would come, mutinies will be repeated.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Seven ruled &quot;Eastward to a land of wandering for his evil<br />
deed Ka-in must depart. Eastward to a land of wandering for his evil<br />
deed Ka-in must depart&quot;.Ka-in and &quot;his generations shall be<br />
distinguished&quot; By Ningishzidda was the life essence [genotype] of Ka-<br />
in altered: his face a beard could not grow***.....With his sister<br />
Awan as a spouse Ka-in from the Edin departed.&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002,<br />
The Lost Book of Enki, pages 186 - 187].<br />
<br />
They wandered in the wilderness to the east. When Adapa was<br />
on his deathbed, Ninurta fetched Ka-in to Edin in his<br />
rocketship. &quot;The eyesight of Adapa having failed, for recognition of<br />
his sons' faces he touched. The face of Ka-in was beardless&quot; Adapa<br />
told Ka-in, &quot;For your sin of your birthright you are deprived, but of<br />
your seed seven nations will come. In a realm set apart they shall<br />
thrive, distant lands they shall inhabit. But having your brother<br />
with a stone killed, by a stone will be your end.&quot; Ninurta returned<br />
Ka-in to the wilds east of Edin where &quot;in a distant realm Ka-in had<br />
sons and daughters&quot; Ninurta, &quot;for them a city [Nud, also called Dun,<br />
Dunnu and Nu.dun] built, and as he was building, by a falling stone<br />
was he [Ka-in] killed.**** They planted grain and founded and ruled<br />
the city of Nud (Ka-in's successors for the next four generations<br />
were murdered by their sons. For the next three generations, each<br />
ruler of Nud ascended to rule after marrying his sister and murdering<br />
his parents.<br />
<br />
Ka-in's son's son's son (great grandson), Enoch, who succeeded Ka-in<br />
in the fourth generation of Ka-in's descendents, married two of his<br />
own sisters, Adah and Zillah. One of Adah's sons, Jabal, and his<br />
followers lived in tents and raised cattle. Jabal's brother Jubal,<br />
begat a line of musicans who played lyre and flute music. Lamech's<br />
other wife, Zillah, bore Tubal-Cain, who was a smith, &quot;an artificer<br />
of gold, copper and iron.&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 1885, The Wars of Gods and<br />
Men pages111 -112; 2002,The Lost Book of Enki:, pages 181-193].<br />
<br />
ADAPA AND TITI'S OTHER PROGENY AND THEIR ISSUE<br />
<br />
Adapa left behind the descendants of thirty sons and thirty<br />
daughters he and Titi begat. Adapa's descendants divided these<br />
genetic descendants of Enki among them as proteges and taught them<br />
writing, mathematics, well-digging, body oil preparation, harp and<br />
flute mastery and the preparation of elixir of the Inbu fruits.<br />
Adapa's descendants were also taught how to use bitumens for furnaces<br />
for gold smelting and refining. Enlil's son, Nannar, taught them<br />
ceremonies to worship their Nibiran lords. &quot;Of the rites of worship<br />
of the Anunnaki [Those who from Sky Descended, i.e., Nibirans] that<br />
the beginning was.&quot;<br />
The hybrids the Nibirans taught each identified with their respective<br />
Nibiran teachers. Enki taught astronomy to one of his hybrid<br />
descendants, Enkime. Enki's son Marduk rocketed Enkime to the Moon<br />
and Marsbase, then sent him to the spaceport at Sippar, to be Prince<br />
of Earthlings under Nannar's son, Utu/Shamash, who was in charge<br />
there. Lu-Mach, a descendant of Enkime, was appointed workmaster of<br />
the Earthlings in Edin, &quot;the quotas to enforce, the rations to<br />
reduce.&quot; But &quot;in his days conditions on Earth became harsher; the<br />
toilers in field and meadow raised complaints&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 1885,<br />
The Wars of Gods and Men pages 111 -112; 2002,The Lost Book of Enki:,<br />
pages 188-193].<br />
<br />
Climatic, magnetic and astronomical disruptions damaged<br />
Marsbase and forced the Anunnaki leaders, Enki, Ninmah and Enlil, to<br />
meet. Face-to-face, they worried that they, unlike the other<br />
colonists who rotated from Nibiru, were aging. Enki observed &quot;Old on<br />
Earth we became, but those on Earth born are even older sooner.&quot;<br />
<br />
To deal with the celestial crisis, the leaders sent Ninurta,<br />
the son of Enlil and Ninmah &quot;to the Land Beyond the Seas [Andes?] in<br />
the mountainland a Bond Heaven-Earth [transmission tower] to<br />
establish.&quot; They sent Ninurta's rival, Enki's son Marduk, to<br />
evaluate damage at Marsbase. They told the rulers of South Africa,<br />
Enki's son Nergal and Nergal's wife Ereshkigal (Enlil's son<br />
Nannar/Sin's daughter) to run new instruments at Africa's south tip<br />
[Cape Agulhas?] to monitor the space and Earth disturbances.<br />
[Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 195]<br />
<br />
Marduk told his parents he wanted to marry an Earthling,<br />
Sarpanit, daughter of Marduk's Earthling protg, Enkime (a<br />
descendant of Enki's partially-Earthling son, Adapa). Marduk's<br />
mother, Ninti, warned Marduk that if he married Sarpanit &quot;to Nibiru<br />
with his spouse he would never go. His princely rights on Nibiru he<br />
forever will forsake. To this Marduk with a bitter laugh responded:<br />
My rights on Nibiru are nonexixtent. Even on Earth my rights as<br />
firstborn have been trampled&quot; [by Enlil and his heir, Ninurta, who<br />
were given Earth commands]. Marduk vowed to become master of Earth.<br />
<br />
Furious, Enlil beamed Anu on Nibiru stop Marduk and Sarpanit<br />
from marrying. Anu and his counselors ruled, &quot; On Nibiru Adapa, the<br />
maiden's progenitor could not stay....Therefore to return to Nibiru<br />
with her, Marduk must forever be be barred.... Marduk marry can, but<br />
on Nibiru a prince he shall no more be.&quot; Enlil let Marduk and<br />
Sarpanit announce their wedding at Eridu, Enki's place on the Persian<br />
Gulf. But Enlil also ordered that Marduk and Sarpnit, after their<br />
wedding would be banished to his own domain, Egypt, within Enki's<br />
sphere of influence (Abzu/Africa). &quot;A great multitude of Civilized<br />
Earthlings in Eridu assembled,.... Young Anunnaki [Nibiran Colonists<br />
and their pure progeny], Igigi from Lahmu [Mars] in great numbers<br />
came&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 198 - 199] , using<br />
Marduk's wedding as an opportunity to assemble as part of their plan<br />
to capture brides of their own.<br />
<br />
ASTRONAUTS ABDUCT EARTH BRIDES AT MARDUK'S WEDDING, THREATEN EARTH'S<br />
DESTRUCTION UNLESS ANUNNAKI LEADERS RATIFY THEIR UNIONS WITH THE<br />
WOMEN<br />
<br />
200 Igigi-- astronauts-- occupied the landing platform in<br />
Lebanon (the Cedar Mountains), then flew to Edin and mix with the<br />
crowd of Adapa's descendants and Nibiran colonists at Marduk's<br />
wedding. After the ceremony, each astronaut seized one Earthling<br />
maiden. They took the 200 women back to Lebanon and &quot;into a<br />
stronghold the place they made, to the leaders a challenge they<br />
issued...'The Adapite daughters to marry we wish. Your blessing to<br />
this you must give, else by fire all on Earth destroy we will.&quot;<br />
[Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 201]<br />
<br />
Marduk, who commanded the Igigi, championed their abduction<br />
marriages. Enlil fumed; &quot;In his heart things against Marduk and his<br />
Earthlings was Enlil plotting.&quot; Marduk settled some of the Igigi and<br />
their half-Nibiran, half--Adapite issue (&quot;Children of the Rocketships<br />
they were called&quot;) in Babylon; he and Sarpanit stayed with others in<br />
Lebanon. By 100,000 years ago, some of these &quot;Children of the<br />
Rocketships&quot; settled in &quot;the far eastlands, lands of high<br />
mountains.&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 202; 1985,<br />
The Wars of Gods and Men: 346]<br />
<br />
Enlil ordered his successor Ninurta to counter the spread of<br />
Marduk's Earthlings. &quot;'The Earth by Earthlings inherited will be,'<br />
Enlil to Ninurta said. 'Go, the offspring of Ka-in find, with them a<br />
domain of your own prepare'&quot; To counter Marduk's threat, Ninurta<br />
recruited the descendants of Ka-in. He showed them how to build<br />
balsam rafts. They crossed the seas to the Western Hemisphere, where<br />
Ninurta taught them tin and gold mining, smelting and refining.<br />
[Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 203]<br />
<br />
ENKI BEGATS NOAH<br />
<br />
Enki lusted for Batanash, wife of his son Adapa's descendant,<br />
Lu-Mach, Workmaster of Earthlings in Edin. Enlil had ordered Lu-<br />
Mach to enforce work quotas and reduce rations for the Earthlings he<br />
directed. The Earthlings grumbled and they threatened Lu-Mach. Enki<br />
sent Lu-March to Marduk in Babylon to learn city-building and sent<br />
Batanash to Ninmah at the Medical/Science complex of Shurubak, &quot;from<br />
the angry Earthling masses protected and safe to be. Thereafter Enki<br />
his sister Ninmah in Shurubak was quick to visit. On the roof of a<br />
dwelling where Batanash was bathing Enki by her loins took hold, he<br />
kissed her, his semen into her womb he poured.&quot; From this encounter,<br />
she bore Ziusudra (Noah).<br />
<br />
When Lu-Mach returned to Edin, &quot;to him Batanash the son<br />
showed. White as the snow his skin was.... Like the skies were his<br />
eyes, in a brilliance his eyes were shining.&quot; Lu-Mach complained, &quot;A<br />
son unlike an Earthling to Batanash was born.... Is one of the Igigi<br />
his father?&quot; Batanash swore &quot;None of the Igigi is the boy's father.&quot;<br />
Lu-Mach's father Matushal assured him Ziusudra was destined to help<br />
Earhlings survive the Ice Age Earth was entering.<br />
<br />
While Ninmah loved and cared for Ziusudra and Enki taught him to read<br />
Adapa's writings, drought, plague and starvation stalked the<br />
Earthlings. [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 204 -205]<br />
Enki and Ninmah proposed teaching Earthlings medicine for plague, sea-<br />
fishing and pond and canal building for drought and famine.<br />
<br />
Enlil (Yahweh), however, was still enraged at Enki for<br />
creating the Earthling hybrids. Enlil was also furious at Enki's son<br />
Marduk, who was recruiting the hybrid line descended from the the<br />
daughters of Adapa whom the astronauts had abducted at Marduk's<br />
wedding to the Earthling Sarpanit. Marduk was conditioning this<br />
hybrid population to serve him for the time when he and the<br />
astronauts who had taken hybrid women must remain on Earth, the time<br />
when enough gold had been sent to Nibiru to shield the homeplanet's<br />
atmosphere and the other Nibirans would return home. So Enlil<br />
forbade any help for the Earthlings. &quot;Let the Earthlings by hunger<br />
and pestilence perish,&quot; decreed Enlil. To speed the demise of the<br />
Earthlings, Enlil specifically ordered Enki to block Earthlings'<br />
access to ocean fish.<br />
<br />
The Earthlings at Shurubak, where Ziusudra lived under Enki<br />
and Ninmah's tutilage, sent Ziusudra to Enki for help. Enki<br />
suggested the Earthlings protest Enlil's anti-Earthling policy and<br />
boycott worship of and service to their Nibiran lords, but said he<br />
couldn't openly ignore Enlil's order and help the Earthlings.<br />
<br />
Covertly, however, Enki fed Earthlings from his corn stores,<br />
trained them in sea fishing and gave them access to the sea. When<br />
Enlil accused Enki of defying his decree that humans be allowed to<br />
perish, Enki lied. He said the humans acted without his knowledge.<br />
Enlil planned for the final destruction of Earthlings and the end to<br />
Nibiran occupation of Earth [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of<br />
Enki: 206; 1978, The 12th Planet, pages 292 -294].<br />
<br />
Each 3,600 year revolution of Nibiru to the region of Solaris<br />
created ever more violent disturbances on Nibiru, the sun (huge solar<br />
flares) Mars (Lahmu) and Earth. On Earth, Nergal reported from the<br />
south tip of Africa that the Antarctic ice sheet was sliding to the<br />
ocean and would, next approach of Nibiru, slide into the sea and<br />
cause wave reverberations that would engulf most of Earth.<br />
<br />
GALZU KEEPS ANUNNAKI LEADERS ON MISSION EARTH<br />
<br />
Anu and the Counsel on Nibiru beamed Earth: &quot;'For evacuating<br />
Earth and Lahmu prepare.' In the Abzu [Zimbabwe] the gold mines shut<br />
down; therefrom the Anunnaki [colonists on Earth from Nibiru] to the<br />
Edin came; ... smelting and refining ceased, all gold to Nibiru was<br />
lofted. Empty, for evacuating ready, a fleet of celestial chariots<br />
[interplanetary spaceships] to Earth returned.&quot; One spaceship<br />
brought the mysterious white-haired Galzu (Great Knower) with a<br />
sealed message from Anu to Enki, Enlil and Ninmah [Sitchin, Z.,<br />
2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 208].<br />
<br />
&quot;Enlil the seal of Anu examined; unbroken and authentic it<br />
was, its encoding trustworthy. 'For King and Council Galzu speaks.<br />
his words are my commands.' So did the message of Anu state. 'I am<br />
Galzu, Emissary Plenipoteniary of King and Council, to Enlil,'&quot; he<br />
said.<br />
<br />
Plenipoteniary Galzu summonsed Enlil's elder sister and<br />
brother, Ninmah and Enki. Galzu told Ninmah, &quot;'Of the same school and<br />
age we are.' This Ninmah could not recall: the emissary was as young<br />
as a son, she was as his olden mother.&quot; Galzu told Ninmah she aged<br />
and he hadn't because she'd been so long on Earth. She and her<br />
brothers had been on Earth so long that they'd die if they returned<br />
to Nibiru, where their bodies could not survive the homeplanet's<br />
netforce.<br />
<br />
&quot;The three of you on Earth will remain; only to die to Nibiru<br />
you will return.&quot; Ninmah and her brothers must orbit Earth in their<br />
rockets when the antarctic icesheet slipped into the ocean and waves<br />
washed over the planet. When the waters calmed, the Leaders were to<br />
return to Earth, the only place they could survive.<br />
<br />
King Anu's order continued, &quot;To each of the other Anunnaki, a<br />
choice to leave or the calamity outwait must be given. The Igigi<br />
[astronauts] who Earthlings espoused must between departure and<br />
spouses choose. No Earthling, Marduk's Sarpanit included, to Nibiru<br />
to journey is allowed. For all who stay and what happens see, in<br />
celestial chariots they safety must seek.&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The<br />
Lost Book of Enki: 209 - 211].<br />
<br />
Enlil convened the Anunnaki Council, which consisted of the<br />
Leaders' sons and grandchildren and the Igigi commanders. He said he<br />
decided the Earthlings must drown in the deluge.<br />
<br />
Enki protested, &quot;'A wonderous Being by us was created, by us<br />
saved it must be,' Enki to Enlil shouted.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Enlil roared back,&quot;'To Primitive Workers you gave to them<br />
knowing you endowed. The powers of the Creator of All into your hands<br />
you have taken. With fornication Adapa you conceived , Understanding<br />
to his line you gave. His offspring to the heavens you have taken,<br />
our wisdom with them you shared. Every rule you have broken,<br />
decisions and commands you ignored. Because of you a Civilized<br />
Earthling brother [Abael] a brother [Ka-in] murdered. Because of<br />
Marduk your son the Igigi like him with Earthlings intermarried.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Enlil demanded Enki and all swear not to tell the Earthlings<br />
of the impending inundation. Enki refused; he and Marduk stamped out<br />
of the Council. But Enki was still reluctant to openly defy Enlil.,<br />
who, after all, had drawn command of Earth Mission [Sitchin, Z.,<br />
2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 212 -214].<br />
<br />
Enlil brought the Council back to order. Astronauts with<br />
Adapite wives and children, he decreed, must move to the peaks above<br />
wave level. When the deluge engulfed Earth, repatriating colonists<br />
would rocket to Nibiru. &quot;On Earth shall Enki, Ninmah, and I--as well<br />
as our sons, daughters and their descendants--will orbit Earth till<br />
the Earthlings drown and the waters recede.&quot;.<br />
<br />
In preparation for the flood, Enki and Ninmah buried their<br />
records and computer programs deep in the Iraqi soil. They prepared<br />
genetic banks of Earth's creatures to save from coming flood. &quot;Male<br />
and female essences and life-eggs they collected, of each kind two by<br />
two ... they collected for safekeeping while in Earth circuit to be<br />
taken, thereafter the living kinds to recombine. The day of the<br />
deluge they waited.&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki:<br />
216].<br />
<br />
GALZU HELPS ENKI SAVE ZIUSUDRA &amp; EARTHLINGS<br />
<br />
The Story: Enlil, Earth's Nibiran Commander, convened the<br />
Anunnaki Council, the leaders' sons and grandchildren and the Igigi<br />
astronaut commanders. He ordered all to conceal news of the deluge<br />
to come from the Earthlings who, he ruled, must drown. He warned<br />
astronauts with Adapite wives and descendants to flee to the peaks<br />
above the flood. &quot;Colonists will repatriate to Nibiru while Enki,<br />
Ninmah and your Commander, I Enlil, our kids and grandchildren will<br />
orbit till the Earthlings are exterminated in the waters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Enki dreamed Galzu said &quot;Into your hands Fate take, for the<br />
Earthlings the Earth inherit. Summon your son Ziusudra, without<br />
breaking the oath [swearing not to tell humans] to him the coming<br />
calamity reveal. A boat that the watery avalanche can withstand, a<br />
submersible one, to build him tell, the likes of which on this tablet<br />
to you I am showing. Let him in it save himself and his kinfolk and<br />
the seed of all that is useful, be it plant or animal, also take.<br />
That is the will of the Creator of All.&quot;<br />
<br />
Enki woke and pondered his dream. When he got out of bed,<br />
much to his amazement, he kicked an actual tablet-- where none had<br />
been before he slept--next to his bed. He searched his home and<br />
grounds for Galzu but Galzu's was not there, nor had anyone seen him,<br />
except Enki, in the dream.<br />
<br />
The appearance of the tablet--a physical object--following a<br />
dream or trance encounter with a representative of a higher power--<br />
Galzu in this instance-- is what Sitchin calls a Twightlight Zone<br />
miracle.<br />
<br />
&quot;That night to the reed hut where Ziusudra was sleeping Enki<br />
stealthily went. The oath not breaking, the lord Enki not to Ziusudra<br />
but to the hut's wall [computer bank?] spoke from behind the reed<br />
wall. When Ziusudra by the words was awakened, to him Enki<br />
said, &quot;Reed hut, a calamitous storm will sweep, the destruction of<br />
Mankind it will be. This is the decision of the assembly by Enlil<br />
convened. 'Abandon thy house, build a boat. Its design and<br />
measurements on a tablet....A boatguide [Enki's son, Ninagal] to you<br />
will come. To a safe haven the boatguide will navigate you. By you<br />
shall the seed of Civilized Man survive. Not to you Ziusudra, have I<br />
spoken, but to the reed wall did I speak.'&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The<br />
Lost Book of Enki: abridged from pages 220 -222]<br />
<br />
13,000 years ago, &quot;in the Whiteland, at the Earth's bottom,<br />
off its foundation, the [Antarctic] icesheet slipped. By Nibiru's<br />
netforce it was pulled into the south sea. A tidal wave arose,<br />
northward spreading. The boat of Ziusudra the tidal wave from its<br />
moorings lifted. Though completely submerged, not a drop of water<br />
into it did enter. For forty days, waves and storms swept Earth,<br />
downing everything on the planet except those on mountaintops and in<br />
Ziusudra's boat&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: abridged<br />
from page 227].<br />
<br />
Surfacing, Ningal raised sail and steered to Mt Arrata, where<br />
Ziusudra built a huge fire as a signal and roasted lamb as an<br />
offering to Enki. Enki and Enlil descended in helicopters<br />
(Whirlwinds) from their rocketships. &quot;When Enlil the survivors saw,<br />
Ningal among them, &quot;`Every Earthling had to perish, he with fury<br />
shouted'; at Enki with anger he lunged, to kill his brother with bare<br />
hands he was ready.&quot; Ningal radioed Ninmah and Ninurta to bring<br />
their copters down quick.<br />
<br />
&quot;`He is no mere mortal, my son he is,' Enki to Ziusudra<br />
pointing. `To a reed wall I spoke, not Ziusudra' Enki said.&quot; Enki,<br />
joined by Ninmah and Ninurta, revealed his dream vision. He told<br />
Enlil of the instructions and tablet Galzu gave him. Together, Enki,<br />
Ninurta and Nimah convinced Enlil &quot;The survival of mankind the will<br />
of the Creator of All must be.&quot; [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book<br />
of Enki: abridged from pages 228 - 229].<br />

There is never any real effort put into explaining why this is the reality. Only stories and suggestive observations of past events etc.</div>

<br />
The past 100 years alone have shown us that as a species we are very capable of revitalizing ourselves.  Our technological advancements are simply amazing if you explore the scope of it all.  Certainly, the debate will arise whether these advancements were of our own doing or did we have intervention.  Looking back to the time of the Sumerian's, we can recognize that from a technological point of view, we are infants today.  The technology available to the Sumerian's far exceeded that of today.  If we are to accept the Sumerian Cuneiform and Tablets at face value, we open a whole new world of understanding.  The late Carl Sagan, famous for his 13-part TV series Cosmos, explored this very concept in his book, &quot;Intelligent Life in the Universe&quot;.  He indicated Earth had likely been visited by extraterrestrials. He states: &quot;Sumer was an early--perhaps the first civilization the contemporary sense on the planet Earth. It was founded in the forth millennium B.C. or earlier. We don't know where the Sumerians came from. I feel that if the Sumerian civilization is depicted by the descendants of the Sumerians themselves to be of non-human origin, the relevant legends should be examined carefully.&quot; (Page 456).  More from Sagan:<br />
<br />
&quot;Some years ago, I came upon a legend which more nearly fulfills some of our criteria for a genuine contact myth. It is of special interest because it relates to the origin of Sumerian civilization. Sumer was an early -- perhaps the first -- civilization in the contemporary sense on the planet Earth. It was founded in the fourth millennium BC, or earlier. We do not know where the Sumerians came from; their language was strange . . . . <br />
<br />
Taken at face value, the legend suggests that contact occurred between human beings and a non-human civilization of immense powers on the shores of the Persian Gulf, perhaps near the site of the ancient Sumerian city of Eridu, and in the fourth millennium BC or earlier. There are three different but cross-referenced accounts of the Apkallu dating from classical times. Each can be traced back to Berosus, a priest of Bel-Marduk, in the city of Babylon, at the time of Alexander the Great.&quot;<br />

I would elaborate more, but I simply believe like others that all the different races once lived out in space and are attempting to do so again.  How the different races ended up on Earth is somehow lost.  Possibly because a war waged in space in which the only survivors were children is mostly likely why nobody knew anything to make note of such.  What if the different landmasses on Earth, including our oceans might of came from the sole survivors home worlds.  After all isn't Alabama's red soil very similar to Mars?</div>

			"articleBody": "The Anunnaki's Story of Earth's Creation\n\nForget about all you heard from your Bible's Story of Creation!\n\nExtrapolations from Zacheria Sitchin's Lost Book of Enki: Memoirs and\nProphesies of an Extraterrestrial God\nSasha Lessin, Ph.D. sashalessinphd@...\n\nSix thousand years ago, astronaut\/pioneers from the planet\nNibiru dictated Enuma elish--the Creation Epic--to the Sumerians. The\nCreation Epic says our Sun, a solitary star at this time in its\nhistory(1), first created a planet the Nibirans called Tiamat. Tiamat\nwas the proto-Earth. It orbited Sun counterclockwise.\n\nNext, the Sun, called Apsu, created Mercury and propelled\nMercury with water and gold to Tiamat. Venus and Mars, Jupiter and\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune formed as pairs and orbited the Sun\ncounterclockwise too. Tiamat lacked a partner-planet, but one of her\nmoons, Kingu, enlarged. Kingu was about to become Tiamat's partner\nplanet and orbit the Sun, rather than Tiamat.\n\nBut, four billion years ago, before Kingu could attain\nplanetary orbit around the sun, Nibiru entered the Solar System\nclockwise and split off a piece of Neptune. That chunk of Neptune\nbecame its moon, Triton. Triton, unlike other moons in the System,\norbits Neptune clockwise. As Nibiru passed through the Solar System,\nit lost three moons, tore four moons from Uranus and tilted Uranus'\norbit. Then Nibiru ripped eleven moons from Tiamat and pulled Gaga,\nSaturn's largest moon, into clockwise orbit (between Neptune and\nUranus) where Gaga is now Pluto.\n\nSome of Nibiru's moons hit Tiamat, creating the Pacific Basin\nin what was left of Tiamat. That intact remainder of Tiamat is Earth.\nIn the Pacific, waters and life-seeds of Nibiru and Tiamat evolved\ntogether. The shards of Tiamat (from the Pacific gouge Nibiru's moon\nmade) are Asteroids and comets. Nibiru's gravity took all Tiamat's\nmoons but Kingu. Nibiru's invasion left Kingu lifelessly orbiting\nEarth. Tiamat's other moons became satellites of Nibiru.\n\nNibiru stabilized into a clockwise orbit (equal to 3,600\norbits of Earth around the Sun).\n\nIn the Creation Epic, the Sumerians knew and wrote of an\nadvanced civilization on a planet in a different solar system. They\nhad the concept of a pulsar, the star around which Nibiru had orbited\nbefore that star collapsed. The Niburan astronauts, the Lords, had\ntheir Sumerian scribes write--only lately being confirmed by our\nscientists--of the composition and movement of the astronomical\nbodies of Solaris' system. The Lords told the Sumerians that there\nwas water on asteroids, comets, Neptune, Uranus, Venus, Mars, Saturn,\nJupiter, also on the rings of Saturn and Saturn's and Jupiter's moons\nas well. Our astronomers recently confirmed what the Lords dictated.\nThe Sumerian Creation Epic lends compelling evidence for the\nextraterrestrial settlement of Earth by Nibirans, the human\nastronauts who came to be regarded as the gods of Earth.\n\nMillennia passed after Nibiru and the solar system achieved\nrelative orbital stability around the Solaris. Life on Nibiru\nevolved, culminated in technologically-sophisticated, long-lived homo\nsapiens, the humans of Nibiru. Nibirans unified, after disastrous\nthermonuclear wars, under a single kingship. But Nibiru was losing\nits atmosphere, critical to heat regulation and survival.\n\n500,000 years ago, King Lahma vacillated over how to deal\nwith the escaping atmosphere. Should he nuke the volcanoes to\nregenerate the atmosphere? Or should he send miners to Solaris'\nAsteroids, where probes registered gold which could be powdered and\nspread as a shield for Nibiru's atmosphere?\n\nPrince Alalu, exasperated by Lahmu's inaction and desperate\nto save Nibiru, pushed Lahma off a tower.\n\nLahma's heir, Anu, agreed at first to Alalu's rule. Alalu\nand Anu sealed their alliance when Anu's firstborn son, Ea\/Enki\n(whose autobiography, compiled by Sitchin, is the principal authority\nfor our tale), married Dimkina, Alalu's Daughter.\n\nEa related how Anu had earlier denied him his bride-to-be,\nhis (Ea's) half-sister Ninmah, when she bore the child of their half-\nbrother, Enlil. Anu simultaneously honored Ea and proclaimed fealty\nto Alalu by offering a compromise successor to the houses of both\nAlalu and Anu via the child Dimkina and Ea will create, the baby\nMarduk.\n\nAlalu nuked the volcanoes, but this failed to re-establish\nNibiru's atmosphere. He also failed to get gold for an atmospheric\nshield from the Asteroids; en route, the rocket of goldminers he sent\ncrashed without survivors. For nine more Nibiran years (nine orbits\nof Nibiru around Solarisâ€“32, 400 Earth years), Alalu's rule gave no\nrelief from atmospheric degredation.\n\nAnu, rightful king by Nibiran tradition, challenged\nAlalu. \"Anu gave battle to Alalu. To hand-to-hand combat, with bodies\nnaked, Alalu he challenged. Alalu in combat was defeated; by acclaim\nAnu was hailed as king.\" (Sitchin, Lost Book of Enki pages 24 - 39)\n\nAlalu stole a missile-armed rocket and blasted from Nibiru to\nEarth. From Earth, he controlled the gold Nibiru needed to survive.\nHe positioned his nukes to blast Nibiru on its next pass by Earth.\nAlalu dangled gold as a carrot and menaced missiles as a stick. To\nAnu on Nibiru he beamed, \"On another world I am, the gold of\nsalvation I have found. The fate of Nibiru is in my hands. To my\nconditions you must give heed!\" [Sitchin, Lost Book of Enki page 60]\n\n\"Return my throne,\" Alalu demanded. But Anu's Foremost Son,\nEnlil, demanded proof of gold on Earth. So Alalu documented his\nproof and transmitted it to the home planet. Enlil distrusted the\nproof. He asked Anu to convene the Nibiru Council. In the Council,\nEnlil and the counselors implored Anu to keep his kingship.\n\nThe scientist Ea, Firstborn Son of Anu, addressed the\nCouncil. Although Ea was Anu's Firstborn Son, Ea was second in\nsuccession to Anu's throne. The first to succeed Anu was Enlil, the\nForemost Son. Enlil was first in succession because his mother,\nAnu's Royal Spouse, Antu, was Anu's half-sister. This made Enlil, not\nEa, Anu's Foremost Son by Nibiru succession rules.\n\nEa, however, though only Firstbornâ€“not Foremost--Son, married\nDamkina, Alalu's Daughter. As Alalu's son-in-law as well as Anu's\nFirstborn, Ea could be an acceptable go-between for both Anu and\nAlalu. Thus all in the Council listened intently to Ea address the\nthreat and promise Alalu was offering them..\n\nEa proposed that he, in person, verify gold on Earth. If\nthere's gold there, Ea said, let Alalu be Earth's King. If the gold\nsaves Nibiru's atmosphere, Anu and Alalu can wrestle for kingship of\nNibiru. \"Let me in a chariot [rocket] to Earth journey, a path\nthrough the Bracelet [Asteroids] with water, not fire [Alalu had used\nnuclear missiles to get through the Asteroids] I shall fashion. On\nEarth, from the waters let me the precious gold to obtain; to Nibiru\nback it will be sent.\" [op.cit: 66] Anu endorsed Ea's plan and sent\nhim with pilot Anzu and fifty male astronauts to Earth. Enlil\nseethed with frustration that Ea pre-empted the heroic mission to\nEarth.\n\nEa, rocketing to Earth in his spaceship, used up his water\nsupplyâ€“needed for the propulsion sysem--blasting Asteroids in his\nway. He landed on Mars to draw water from a lake, then rocketed for\nEarth, \"its gold Nibiru's fate for salvation or doom containing.\"\n[op.cit., 71] The astronauts splashed into the Persian Gulf; there\nAlalu guided them ashore.\n\nEa built a settlement, Eridu, at the head of the Persian\nGulf. From the Gulf, he extracted some gold. He built a plane, and\nwith his personal pilot, Abgal, tested for more gold all over the\nplanet.\n\nAnu beamed orders from Nibiru to Earth. He commanded Ea to\nsend Alalu's ship back to Nibiru with as much gold as possible. In\nAlalu's rocket, Ea and Abgal found seven nuclear missiles. They hid\nthe nukes in a cave.\n\nAnzu, the interplanetary pilot, came to ready Alalu's rocket\nto return to Nibiru. But when he saw the missiles gone from the ship,\nAnzu confronted Ea. \"When we flew to Earth, we used only water\ncannon to blast through the Astroids and we almost killed our engine\nbecause our water was wasted blowing rocks out of our way. So I need\nthe nukes you took from this ship to get through the Asteroids back\nto Nibiru.\"\n\nEa retorted, \"Foresworn is the weapons' use.\" [SItichin, Z.,\n2002, The Lost Book of Enki, page 82]. \"In view of your attitude,\nI'm replacing you as pilot; you stay here on Earth. Abgal, my\npersonal pilot, will take Alalu's ship back to Nibiru. And he'll do\nit with water cannon only. I said no nukes and I mean it.\"\n\nEa programmed a return route through the Asteroids and Abgal\nflew the spacecraft to Nibiru with sample gold to test as an\natmospheric shield there.\n\nOn Nibiru, scientists processed the gold \"to make of it the\nfinest dust, to skyward launch it was hauled away. A Shar [one orbit\nof Nibiru around the Sun, equal to 3,600 Earth years; Nibiruans live\nso long they seem immortal by our standards] did the fashioning last,\na Shar did the testing continue. With rockets was the dust heavenward\ncarried, by crystals' beams was it dispersed. [But] when Nibiru near\nthe Sun came, the golden dust was by its rays disturbed; the healing\nin the atmosphere was dwindled, the breach to bigness returned.\"\n[Sitchin, Z., Lost Book of Enki, page 86] Anu sent Abgal back to\nEarth for more gold.\n\nOn Earth again, Abgal found only a small gold yield, all Ea\ncould mine from the Gulf so far. Ea sent Abgal to Nibiru again with\nthis disappointing yield of gold. Prospecting, Ea found gold, huge\nveins of it, in southeast Africa (Abzu). Jubilant, he announced his\nfind to Nibiru.\n\nBack on Nibiru, Anu and Enlil received Ea's news of vast\nveins of gold. Enlil, angry still that brother Ea leads the Earth\nMission, demanded proof, not just of gold, but of lots of gold. \"Ea\nalready gave false hope that enough gold could come from Earth's\nwaters to save Nibiru's atmosphere.\"\n\nAnu, unhappy with Enlil's constant complaints about Ea, gave\nin. \"Enlil, I'm sending you to Earth; there, you'll be in charge.\nCheck on Ea's find.\n\nWhen Enlil made landfall on Earth, he beamed back that,\ndespite his initial doubts, Earth probably had gold enough to save\nNibiru's atmosphere.\n\nBut the basic rivalry between Ea and Enlil (that plagues\nEarth to this day) surfaced again.*\n\n\"Father Anu,\" Enlil broadcast from Earth to Nibiru, \"Affirm,\nby the law of succession, that I, your son by your own half-sister\nAntu, precedes and has authority over Ea, though, he, your eldest\nson, be.\"\n\n\"Come,\" Enlil implored, \"to Earth in person and deal with\nAlalu, too, who thinks he's king here and says he should rule Nibiru\nas well.\"\n\n\"So, 416, 000 years ago, Anu flew to Earth and drew lots with\nEa and Enlil. At the drawing, Anu decreed, one lot would bestow rule\nover Nibiru; another lot would give its holder rule of Earth and\ncontrol the Persian Gulf headquarters; the last lot would give\nresponsibility for African mining operations and sea transport .\n\n\"By their lots the tasks they divided; Anu to Nibiru to\nreturn, its ruler on the throne to remain. The Edin [Mesopotamia] to\nEnlil was allotted, to be Lord of Command, more settlements to\nestablish, of the skyships and their heros charge to take. Of all the\nlands until they the bar of the seas encounter, the leader to be. To\nEa the seas and the oceans as his domain were granted, lands beyond\nthe bar of the waters by him to be governed, in the Abzu\n[southeastern Africa] to be the master, with ingenuity the gold to\nprocure.'\" [Sitchin, Z., Lost Book of Enki, pages 92 -93]\n\nEnlil's first act was to award Enki his initial settlement,\nEridu, on the Persian Gulf, in perpetuity.\n\nNo sooner did Anu and his sons divide rule of Nibiru and\nEarth, than \"Forward toward Anu Alalu stepped, shouted, `Mastery of\nEarth to me was allotted; that was the promise when the gold finds to\nNibiru I announced! Nor have I the claim to Nibiru's throne\nforsaken.'\" [op.cit. 93] Anu wrestled Alalu. \"Anu on the chest of\nAlalu with his foot pressed down, victory in the wrestling thereby\ndeclaring, `I am King'\"\n\nBut when Anu lifted his foot from Alalu, \"swiftly he the\nmanhood of Anu bit off, the malehood of Anu Alalu did swallow.!\"\n[op.cit.94] Enlil tied Alalu up while Ea gave Anu first-aid. Alalu,\nAnu groaned, will slowly die from his seed.\n\nAnu condemned Alalu to spend his last days on Mars. Anu, on\nhis return trip to Nibiru, dropped Alalu on Mars, with food and\ntools. Anu also left Alalu's kinsman, Anzu--the interplanetary pilot\nEa had discharged, to care for Alalu as he died on Mars.\n\nWhen Anu arrived back on Nibiru, he told the Council his\nplans for gold hunting through the solar system. He ordered\ncontinuous freight rockets to and from Earth. \"Rockets will shuttle\namong way-stations on Mars, Earth's Moon, other planets and\nsatellites between Nibiru and the sun.\n\nNINMAH, ENROUTE TO EARTH, SAVES ANZU ON MARS, STARTS MARSBASE\n\n\"King Anu sent his daughter Ninmah with female health\nofficers to Earth. \"Stop,\" said the King, \"on the way, at Mars. If\nAnzu lives, give him men to set up a base there.\"\n\nOn Mars Ninmah found Alalu and Anzu dead. It was too late\nfor the condemned Alalu, but Ninmah revived Anzu.\nTo commemorate Alalu who discovered the gold that can save Nibiru,\nNinmah and Anzu,\"The image of Alalu upon the great rock mountain with\nbeams they carved\" [Sitchin, Z., The Lost Book of Enki, page 104].\n\nNinmah gave Anzu twenty of the astronauts from her company\nand ordered him to build the first way station for the gold\nfreighters.\n\nEA, NINMAH & ENLIL\n\nLet us pause in the narrative of Ninmah's journey to Mars and\nEarth to explicate her relationship to her half-brothers, Ea\/Enki and\nEnlil.\n\n\"Enki and Enlil and Ninmah...Offspring of Anu the three\nleaders were, by different mothers. Enki was the Firstborn Son; a\nconcubine of Anu's was his mother. Enlil by Antu, the spouse of Anu,\nwas born; the Legal Heir he thus became. Ninmah by another concubine\nwas mothered, a half sister of the two half brothers she\nwas....Greatly beautiful she was, full of wisdom, one quick to learn.\n\n\"Ea, as Enki was then named, by Anu to espouse Ninmah was\nchosen, thereby their offspring son the legal successor thereafter to\nbecome. Ninmah of Enlil, a dashing commander, was enamored; by him\nshe was seduced.... \" [SItichin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki,\npages 112-113] Ea dictates to his scribe. (The rivalry between Ea\nand Enlil--the critical competition that still affects Earth, shows\nhere, as Ea refers to the sexual connection between his fianc Ninmah\nand their half-brother, Commander Enlil, as \"seduction.\")\n\n\"A son from Enlil's seed Ninmah bore, Ninurta.... Anu\nangered; as punishment he Ninmah ever to be a spouse forbade! Ea his\nbride-to-be by Anu's decree abandoned; a princess named Damkina\n[Alalu's daughter] he instead espoused; a son, an heir to them was\nborn, Marduk.\" [Sitichin, 2002, op. cit.]\n\nEa continues, \"A son from Enlil's seed Ninmah bore,\nNinurta.... Anu angered; as punishment he Ninmah ever to be a spouse\nforbade! Ea his bride-to-be by Anu's decree abandoned; a princess\nnamed Damkina [Alalu's daughter] he instead espoused; a son, an heir\nto them was born, Marduk.\" [Sitichin, 2002, op. cit.] Through his\nmother, Marduk carries the heritage of Alalu: a propensity to strive\nendlessly for dominance.\n\nWe return from our genealogical segue to Ninmah's journey to\nEarth. We left her on Mars.\n\nNinmah and Anzu finished Alalu's monument on Mars [The faceâ€“\nAlalu's--NASA photographed, then denied]; she rocketed on to Earth.\n\nAs soon as she made planetfall on Earth, Nimmah showed Enlil\nand Ea seeds she brought. She tells them the seeds will bear a fruit\nfrom which a \"euphoric elixer\" can be made.\n\nEnlil lured Ninmah into his airplane and flies her to his\nhouse \"by the Cedar Forest\" [Lebanon], as a perfect place to plant\nher seeds. \"Once inside, Enlil embraced her, with fervor he kissed\nNinmah, 'Oh my sister, my beloved!' Enlil to her whispered. By her\nloins he grabbed her.\" But \"Into her womb his semen he did not pour.\"\n[op.cit., 108] Though he promised her a healing city and said he'll\nbring their son Ninurta to Earth, she remained sexually aloof from\nEnki.\n\nHurt when Ninmah's rejected him sexually, Enki mooned about\nhis gardens. He watched Sud, Ninmah's gorgeous Assistant Health\nOfficer who'd been assigned to landing platform there in Lebanon,\nbathing in his stream with the other young women from the medical\nteam. Enlil invited Sud to get high on elixir made from seeds Ninmah\nbrought from Nibiru and planted in his garden.\n\n\"Sud drank, Enlil drank too; to her Enlil of intercourse was\nspeaking. Unwilling was the lass....Enlil laughed and embraced her,\nkissed her. His semen into her womb he poured.\n\nTo Ninmah, Sud's commander, the immoral deed was reported.\nEnlil, immoral one. For your deed judgement you shall face. So did\nNinmah to Enlil in anger say. In the presence of fifty Anunnaki\nSeven Who Judge were assembled. On Enlil a punishment decreed: Let\nEnlil from all cities be banished...Let him exiled be. In a\nskychamber they made Enlil leave the Landing Place [Lebanon]; Abgal\nwas his pilot.\" [SItichin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki, pages 113-\n114]\n\nAbgal, remember, was the pilot Ea had promoted from airplane\npilot to rocket pilot Abgal'd helped Enki hide Alalu's nuclear\nmissiles.\n\nENLIL BANISHED FOR RAPE; ABGAL BETRAYS ENIK, SHOWS ENLIL ALALU'S NUKES\n\nAbgal takes Enlil to exile in Africa but shows him the nukes'\ncave there. Abgal says, \"Take the weapons into your possession, with\nthe weapons your freedom obtain!\" [op. cit., 114]\n\nMeanwhile, Sud's pregnant from Enlil's rape. Enki and the\ntribunal ask Sud if she'd marry Enlil if she were his official\nspouse. She agrees to marry Enlil as his royal wife. So the\ntribunal and even Ninmah pardon Enlil and he and Sud marry. Sud's\ngiven the title Ninti and bears Nannar\/Sin, the first Nibiran Royal\nborn on Earth.\n\nEnki tells Ninmah, \"Come with me in the Abzu ... your\nadoration of Enlil abandon.\" In Africa, \"Enki there to her words of\nloving spoke, sweet words he spoke, 'You are still my beloved' to her\nhe said, caressing. He embraced her, he kissed her, she caused his\nphallus to water. Enki his semen into the womb of Ninmah poured.\nGive me a son' he cried.\" [op. cit., 115]\n\nBut she bears him a daughter, then, immediately, another\ndaughter. When he insists on another pregnancy \"Ninmah against Enki\na curse uttered, whatever food he ate was poison in his innards....\nTo distance himself from Nimmah's vulva Enki by raised arm swore;\nfrom her curse Enki was freed. To the Edin Ninmah returned.\" [op.\ncit., 116]\n\nENLIL & ENKI BREED COMPETING LINEAGES WITHIN ANU'S CLAN\n\nEnki's Lineage: Enki sent to Nibiru for his wife, Damkina,\nand their son, MARDUK. With them, and with the children Damkina\nbore him on Earth, Enki built his clan--Marduk's earthborn half-\nbrothers--NERGAL, GIBIL, NINGISHZIDDA\/THOTH and DIMUZI--and their\nprogeny.\n\nEnki's eldest son, Marduk, recall, was grandson of Alalu.\nWhen Alalu seized the Nibiran Throne he bestowed his daughter,\nDamkina, on Anu's son Enki\/Ea. The first son of Damkina and Ea was\nMarduk. Marduk, Anu and Alalu had at the time agreed, would one day\nreign as King of Nibiru. So Marduk, the son of Enki and Damkina, was\nsupposed to be the heir to the Nibiran throne. But Anu deposed and\ncondemned Alalu, sent Enki and Enki's siblings, Ninma and Enlil to\nEarth.\n\nOn Earth, Enki and Enlil bred lineages. Powerful groups of\nkin who competed for power in Operation Gold Dust.\n\nEnlil bred his clan on Earth with his wife, Sud\/Ninti. Their\nsons together-- NANNAR\/SIN and ISHKUR\/ADAD\/TESHUB--reinforced him and\nhis eldest son, NINURTA (Enlil's illicit child with Ninmah) in their\nstruggles with the Enkiites.\n\nBy some 400,000 years ago, Enlil had established seven\nMission Centers (Sippar the Spaceport; Nippur, Mission Control;\nBadtibira, Metalurgical Center; Shurrupak, Med Center).\n\nAnzu commanded 300 Nibirans on Mars Base and in the shuttle\nservice. His men, the Igigi, rocketed gold from Mesopotamia, where\nEnki's ships brought it from Africa. Anzu's men on Mars transferred\nthe gold to spaceships bound for Nibiru. On Nibiru, scientists\npowdered the gold and seeded it into the air. \"Slowly was the breach\nin the heavens healing.\" [op. cit., 117]\n\nThe Igigi, led by Anzu, demanded Enlil grant them better\nworking conditions, more elixer from the fruit Ninmah grew and a rest\nfacility on Earth. Anu beamed orders from Nibiru for Anzu to go to\nEnlil on Earth where Enlil will show Anzu the entire mining operation\nso he'd understand why the Igigi must persevere.\n\nWhen Anzu arrived at Nippur, Enil's Capitol, he found\nCommander Enlil reluctant to cooperate. Enlil's reluctance to\nreceive Anzu reflected the challenge the Igigi's demands and\nespecially the leadership of Anzu, kinsman to the executed Alalu.\nEnlil insisted he, not Anzu gave orders to the Astronauts. Enlil\nbelieved that he alone had authority over the entire Earth operation;\nAnzu and the astronauts should obey, not challenge him.\n\nEa, however, persuaded Enlil to go ahead and explain the gold\nmining, refining and transport system to Anzu. \"Our father, King\nAnu,\" said Enki, \"says to convince Anzu to keep his men on the job.\"\nSo Enlil admitted Anzu to his chambers.\n\nBut when Enlil took off his clothes and set down the key to\nhis control room, Anzu purloined the key. Anzu then snuck in the\ncontrol room and stole the computer crystals that ran the spaceport\nand the astronaut cities in Mesopotamia. He forced Ea's pilot Abgal\nto take him to the spaceport, Shu.ru.pak. There, Anzu's men declared\nhim king of Earth and Mars. He shut down vital services at\nheadquarters (Nibru-ki) and cut communication between Earth and\nNibiru.\n\nNinurta (Enlil and Ninmah's son) shot Anzu down in an\nspectacular air battle. Ninurta then freed Abgal, captured Anzu and\nretrieved the crystals.\n\nThe Seven Who Judge--Ea\/Enki, Damkina\/Ninki, Marduk\/Ra,\nNannar\/Sin, Enlil\/Yawheh, Ninmah and Ninurta--ordered Anzu\nexecuted \"with a killing ray.\"\n\nMarduk, however, sympathized with the Igigi complaint that\nmade them revoltâ€“no R&R facilities on Earth, infrequent rotations\nback to Nibiru, little elixer. \"OK, Marduk,\" Enlil commanded, \"Go to\nMars and take command of the astronauts; do what you must so they\nobey me unconditionally. On Mars, bury Anzu, improve conditions and\nboost morale among the Igigi.\"\n\nNINURTA SUPERCEDES NANNAR AS ENLIL'S SUCCESSOR ON EARTH\n\nSitchin, in The 12th Planet [pages 107 -116] had earlier said\nthe role of Anzu in The Lost Book of Enki's account of the revolt of\nthe Igigi [pages 117 - 121] was actually the role of Nannar, Enlil's\nLegal Heir (Enlil's first son by his legal spouse), as part of his\n(Nannar's) dynastic challenge to Ninurta (Enlil's Firstborn) for\nCommand of Earth. Perhaps Nannar was the power behind Anzu. Nannar\nwas exiled from Ur, not executed. Nonetheless, after Enlil's son\nNinurta defeated the Igigi and executed their leader, Anzu, all the\nNibiran leaders--including Nannar,--pledged to honor Ninurta as\nEnlil's successor on Earth.\n\nBefore, Ninurta was Enlil's successor only on Nibiru; Enlil's\nsuccessor on Earth had been Nannar, his son with Ninmah. Ninurta,\nnow Enlil's \"Foremost Warrior,\" enforced Enlil's rule over the\nentire system of gold extraction, processing, and transportation to\nthe Nibiru. To make sure Ninurta's obeyed, Enlil gave him the IB\nmissile, \"a weapon with fifty killing heads.\" [Sitchin, 1985, The\nWars of Gods and Men, page 102]\n\nENKI RESPONDS TO MINERS' MUTINY, GRAFTS NIBIRAN & HOMO ERECTUS GENES\nTO MAKE PRIMITIVE WORKERS\n\n300,000 years ago, Earth's climate warms dramatically.\n\nIn Africa, Enki leaves mines to Foreman Ennugi and goes\nNorth, to what's now Zimbabwe, Enki and Ningizidda set up a lab for\nEarth Studies, especially homo erectus, a species Enki identifies as\ndestined to evolve in a few million years into homo sapiens sapiens,\nthe species of the Nibirans. Apemen fascinate Enki, with their\nintelligence, but also for their compassion for other animals, which\nthey free from Enki's traps.\n\nBack at the African goldmining center, miners complained that\nEnnugi worked them too hard. Ennugi radioed Enki, who sympathized\nwith the miners. He secretly coached them to entrap Commander Enlil\nand manipulate him to accept a plan he had for the apemen.\n\nFirst, the miners drastically reduced their shipments of gold\nto Ninurta in Badtibira. Enlil sends Ninurta to investigate.\nNinurta and Ennugi hear miner-complaints. \"They were backbiting and\nlamenting, in the excavations they were grumbling. Unbearable is the\ntoil.\" Enki, sympathizes with the miners and tells Ninurta to invite\nEnlil to the mines and see how the miners suffer.\n\n\nWhen Enlil and his Visier, Nusku, arrive, \"'Let us unnerve\nEnlil'...mine-working heros shouted. 'Of the heavy work let him\nrelieve us. Let us proclaim war, with hostilities let us gain\nrelief.' To their tools they set fire, fire to their axes they\nput.\" They hold Mine Boss Ennugi hostage and, with tools as torches,\nsurround the house Enlil occupies.\"\n\nEnlil radios Anu to shuttle to Earth and execute the miners'\nleaders and their instigator (implying Enki). Anu arrives in Africa\nand conducts an inquiry. But no miner reveals leaders or\ninstigator. Anu also sympathizes with the miners, so Ninurta\nrequests new miners from Nibiru and wants better equipment.\n\nEnki tells Ningishzidda, \"Let us create a Lulu, a primitive\nworker, the hardship to take over, let the Being the toil of the\nAnunnaki [astronaut-pioneers] carry on his back.... The Being that we\nneed, it already exists. All that we have to do is put on it the\nmark of our essence [ie, our genes], thereby a Lulu, a Primitive\nWorker shall be created! [The Lost Book of Enki, pages 124 -127]\n\nEnki, Earth's Lord, showed the apemen to Enlil, Earth's\nCommander and Ninurta, Enlil's Foremost Warrior,\nsays, \"Ningishziddha, my son, their fashioning essence [DNA\nstructure] has tested; akin to ours it is, like two serpents it is\nentwined. When with our life essence shall be combined, our mark\nupon them shall be, a Primitive Worker shall be created. Our\ncommands will he understand. Our tools he will handle, the toil in\nthe excavations he shall perform, to the Anunnaki in the Abuzu\n[Africa] relief shall come.\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of\nEnki, page 130]\n\nEnlil objected to Enki's plan. 'Don't create a\nNibiran\/Apeman slave class here on Earth,' Enlil reminded Enki, \"On\nour planet [Nibiru], slavery has long ago been abolished, tools are\nslaves, not other beings.\" [Sitchin, ibid.] Ninurta added that to\nget gold better, Enki should make tools, not slaves. Enki\nrepied, 'Earthlings we'll create'll be \"helpers,\" not slaves.'\n\nEnlil still protested: hybrid cloning was forbidden in\nthe \"Rules Of Planet To Planet Journeying\" Enki's response 'the\nteam won't create a new species; Erectus is our the genetic\nancestor. He evolves into us--Homo Sapiens, Sapiens--the humans of\nNibiru; we'll just speed him along a few million years.' *\n\nThe brother rivals, Enki and Enlil, beamed their dispute to\nAnu and the Council on Nibiru. Each brother had his say on whether\nEnki's team should develop hybrid workers. Anu and the council\nruled, \"Gold must be obtained. Let the Being be fashioned! The\nCouncil decided....Forsake the Rules of Planetary Journeys, let\nNibiru be saved.\" [Sitchin, op. cit., page 132]\n\nEnki and Ningishzidda had intercourse with apewomen, When no\npregnancies followed, Enki and Ningishzidda used their seed to\nfertilize apewoman ova in test tubes and surgically implant the\nresultant zygotes in apewomen. But the hybrid babies born of the\napewomen lacked vision, hand dexterity or internal functioning.\nNinmah overcame some of the deficiencies when she added copper and\nclay of Earth to the hybrid zygotes' lab environment.\n\nNimah and Enki created test-tube zygotes for primitive worker\nexperiments [Sitchin, Z., The 12th Planet, page 352]. Even with her\nimprovements, the resulting Earthling lacked speech capacity.\n\nEnki implanted a test-tube-grown zygote formed from his\nsperm and an apewoman ovum in Ninmah's womb, rather than the womb of\nan apewoman, to see if the baby Ninmah bore would speak. \"In the\nclay vessel the admixture they made, the oval of an Earth female with\nAnunnaki male essence they put together. The fertilized egg into the\nwomb of Ninmah by Enki was inserted. There was conception. To a\nmale child Ninmah birth was giving. Enki the boy child held in his\nhands, the image of perfection was he. He slapped the newborn on his\nhindparts; the newborn uttered proper sounds. \" He could speak. \"He\nhanded the newborn to Ninmah. 'My hands have made it!' victoriously\nshe shouted.\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki, pages 138 -\n139.]\n\nTHE HYBRID ASTRONAUT\/ERECTUS MALE HAS FORESKIN, WHICH THE ASTRONAUTS\nLACK\n\nThe baby, Adamu [One Who Like Earth's Clay Is], looked like a\ndark red blood-colored, black-haired Nibiru child in every way except\nhis penis. \"They looked at its malehood; odd was its shape, by a\nskin was its forepart surrounded, unlike that of Anunnaki malehood it\nwas. 'Let the Earthling from us Anunnaki by this foreskin be\ndistinguished.' So was Enki saying.\" [Sitchin, op. cit. page 139]\n\nOnce she had Adamu, the prototype for the primitive worker,\nNinmah sent for seven women from her Medical Corps in Shurubak to be\nwomb-mothers to Adamu's clones. \"'His essence alone as a mold shall\nbe!,' so was Enki saying.\" [Sitchin, op. cit. page 141] Ninmah\nassembled her volunteers, prepared the zygotes and pledged unity with\nthe Earthlings they'dl create.\n\"In seven vessels of the clay of Abzu made, Ninmah ovals of the two-\nlegged females placed. The life essences of Adamu she extracted bit\nby bit in the vessels she it inserted. Then in the malepart of Adamu\nan incision she made, a drop of blood to let out. 'Let this a Sign\nof Life be; that Flesh and Soul have combined let it forever\nproclaim.' She squeezed the malepart for blood, one drop in each\nvessel to the admixture she added. 'In this clay's admixture,\nEarthling with Anunnaki shall be bound. To a unity shall the two\nessences, one of Heaven, one of Earth, together be brought.' In the\nwombs of the birth-giving heroines the fertilized ovals were\ninserted.\" [Sitchin, ibid.]\n\nTo duplicate Adamu, Ninmah implanted test-tube hybrid\nzygotes from Erectus eggs fertilized by Nibiran sperm in the wombs of\nseven female astronauts from Ninmah's Medical Corps. All the\nresultant seven hybrids were male.\n\nNingishzidda created a zygoteâ€“Nibiran Ovum fertilized by\nErectus sperm--to develop into a female hybrid who could breed. He\nimplanted this zygote in Ninti, Enki's spouse. The hybrid Ninti bore\nand delivered by caesarian, was female, Ti-Amat [Mother of Life], a\nsandy-blonde.\n\nNingishizzida cloned Ti-Amat's essence into seven test-tube\nzygotes and implanted them in the same Med Corps women who bore the\nhybrid males. All of the surrogate mothers carried female hybrids,\nagain delivered by caesarian. Enki put the seven female and the\neight male hybrids together. The hybrids copulated frequently, but\nthe females didn't conceive.\n\nNinmah objected. \"Surrogacy to create hybrids is too hard on\nmy Med Officers, and can't, in any case, make enough hybrids to work\nthe mines.\n\nThe astronauts laboring in the mines and the gold shuttle\nstaff threatened mutiny if Enki and Ningishziddha fail to deliver\nenough of the promised workers to relieve them of manual labor.\nUnder this pressure, Ningishziddha conducted research at Ninmah's\nMedical Center in Shurubak.\n\nNingishziddha compared the genetic structure of breeding\nNibirans and those of Adamu and Ti-Amat and found the genes in the\nNibiran genotype that allowed reproduction. Nibiran females had a\nrecessive XY chomomsomal allele in their genotype whereas Ti-Amat had\nonly XX.\n\nNingishzidda anesthetized Enki, Ninmah and Ti-Amat.\nThen \"from the rib of Enki the life essence he extracted; into the\nrib of Adamu the life essence he inserted. From the rib of Ninmah\nthe life essence he extracted; into the rib of Ti-Amat the life\nessence he inserted. He proudly declared, 'To their Tree of Life two\nbranches have been added, with procreating powers their life essences\nare now entwined.'\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki, page\n148]\n\nEnki, Ninmah and Ningishziddha kept their alteration of Ti-\nAmat secret and let her and Adamu wander in Enki's orchard in the\nEdin, the mouth of the Persian Gulf, while she gestated. Ti-Amat\nmaked leaf-aprons for herself and Adamu.\n\nENLIL EXPELS ADAMU & TI-AMAT FROM EDEN TO AFRICA\n\n\nEnlil noticed the aprons and demanded explanation. Enki\nconfessed; Enlil was enraged. \"The last bit of our life essence to\nthese creatures you have given, to be like us in procreation knowing,\nperchance our [millions of years] life cycles on them to\nbestow.\" \"My lord Enlil,\" Ningishziddha was saying, \"knowing for\nprocreation they were given, the branch of Long Living, to their\nessence tree was not.\" \"Then let them be where they are needed,\"\nEnlil with anger said. \"To the Abzu [Africa] away from the Edin, let\nthem be expelled.\" [Sitchin, op. cit. page 149]\n\nSitchin writes that Enki's genetic team was speeding up\nhominid evolution that would have occurred anyway. \"Modern man would\nhave undoubtedly evolved on Earth just as he had done on Nibiru, both\nhaving come from the same 'seed of life.' \" Enki and company sped\nour evolution by one to fortty million years. [Genesis Revisited,\npages 165 -166]\n\nENKI BEGATS HIGHER EARTHLING HYBRIDS ON EARTHLING SLAVE GIRLS\n\nHybrid Earthling slaves proliferated Enki's Africa and, as\ntheir numbers grew, were re-introduced to Mesopotamia, there to labor\nfor the Nibiran lords.\n\nBut the hybrids also foraged for food all over Mesopotamia\nand created food shortages for their lords. To alleviate the\nshortages they caused, Enki planned to uplevel the Earthlings'\nintelligence. With enhanced intelligence, Earthlings could tend\nplants and domestic animals.\n\nIn his African reserve, Enki impregnated two beautiful young\nhybrid Earthlings. Both women conceived. One bore a boy whom Enki\nnamed Adapa. The other Earthling bore a girl he called Titi. Enki\nhid the fact that he fathered Adapa and Titi.\nAdapa and Titi mated; Titi bore twins, Ka-in and Abael.\n\nEnki raised Adapa, educating him as the son he was (albeit\nclandestine). Enki taught Adapa plantation, herd and estate\nmanagement. Then Enki brought more Earthlings from Africa to\nMesopotamia and had Adapa train them to serve the Nibiran\ncolonists.\n\nAdapa became \"a busybody, in charge of the services for which\nthe primitive workers were brought over to the Edin; he supervised\nthe bakers, assures water supplies, oversees the fishing for Eridu\n[Enki's estate on the Persian Gulf] and tends offerings\" [Sitchin,\nZ., 1995, Divine Encounters, page 51].\n\nAdapa begged Enki to give him the substances of Nibiru to\nallow him, like the Nibirans, to live for hundreds of thousands of\nyears.\n\nEnki used a device similar to the U.S.'s HAARP laser\nbatteries to halt the wind that blows up the Gulf from the South so\nAdapa could, on a south-sailing vessel, voyage secretly down the\nPersian Gulf.\n\nTales of Adapa's brilliance had already reached King Anu on\nNibiru. When he heard that Enki manipulated Gulf weather to send\nAdapa on his mysterious voyage, Anu sent his vizier Ilabrat to Earth\nto fetch Adapa to Nibiru.\n\nComplying, Enki also sent his two unmarried Earth-born sons,\nNingishzidda and Dumuzi with Adapa to Nibiru to meet their\ngrandfather, King Anu, and perhaps find Nibiran brides.\n\nOn Niburu, Anu questioned Adapa about the craft and the\nmission he'd been on when Enki halted the Gulf wind back on Earth.\nNingishzidda, who'd taken DNA samples from Adapa and knew Adapa must\nbe his nephew, the son of Enki, slipped Grandfather Anu a sealed\ntablet from Enki. In the tablet, Enki confessed fathering Adapa and\nTiti with Earthling hybrids and asked Anu to send Adapa back to Earth\nto generate more hybrids, to father more Civilized Man.\n\nEnki's tablet asked Anu to deny Adapa food or elixirâ€“the\nBread of Life and the Water of Lifeâ€“that would make Adapa and his\nprogeny immortal. The Earthlings, an unprecedented new civilized\nspecies were, Anu realized, his genetic descendents via his son Enki;\ndenying them immortality would keep them quarantined on Earth a long\ntime.\n\nDUMUZU STAYS ON NIBIRU TO LEARN HUSBANDRY, NINGISHZIDDA\nRETURNS TO EARTH WITH ADAPA & SEEDS\n\nKing Anu gave Ningishzidda grain seeds for Earth and told him\nto take the seeds and Adapa back to Earth. The King told\nNingishzidda to become Adapa's tutor and work with Enki. \"You and\nEnki, Ningishzidda, shall be the teachers of Civilized Man.\"\n\nAnu ordered Dumuzi to stay on Nibiru and learn domestic\nanimal husbandry till Nibiru next approached Earth (in one shar--\n3,600 years). When Nibiru neared the Inner Solar System again,\nDumuzi would return to Earth with female goats and sheep and a sperm\nbank for them. [Sitchin, Z., 1995, Divine Encounters, pages 49 - 65;\n2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 173 -174]\n\nKAI-IN AND ABAEL\n\nMarduk, Enki's eldest son, took charge of Abael and his\nanimal husbandry project; livestock was to be a project of the Enki\nlineage. Ninurta, Enlil's eldest son and foremost warrior, tutored\nKa-in in farming. Agriculture was to be a project of the Enlil\nlineage.\n\nDumuzi brought to Earth grain seeds for Ninurta and Ka-in,\none of the twins of Adapa and Titi, to develop. Dumuzi also brought\nfemale sheep and goats as well as the \"essence seeds\" for these\nanimals for Marduk and Ka-in's twin Abael to nurture.\n\nAt a \"Celebration for Firsts,\" Ka-in, guided by Ninurta,\npresented a sample of his first grain. Abael, guided by Marduk,\npresented his first lambs to Enlil and to Enki. Though Enki was both\nmaternal and paternal grandfather of twins Ka-in and Abael, he made\nmuch of Abael's offering and the meat and wool that would soon be\navailable, but says nothing of Ka-in's offering of grain, for Ka-in\nhas been co-opted by Ninurta. Ka-in became sullen. \"By the lack of\nEnki's blessing greatly was he aggrieved\"\n\nThe twins quarreled for an entire winter about whose\ncontributionâ€“Ka-in's grains and fish-abundant canals or Abael's meat\nand wool--contributed most. \"When summer began, it was not raining,\nthe meadows were dry, the pastures dwindled. Into the fields of his\nbrother Abael his flocks drove, from the furrows and canals to drink\nwater. By this Ka-in was angered.\" The twins fought with fists till\nKa-in blugeoned Abael with a stone, then sat and sobbed. [Sitchin,\nZ., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki, page 183- 184].\n\nKA-IN'S LINE\n\nEnki brought his grandson, Ka-in, to Eridu to be judged by\nThe Seven Who Judge (Enlil, Ninki, Ninurta and Nannar from the Enki\nLineage, Ninmah, and Enki, Ninti and Marduk from the Enki Lineage).\nMarduk, Abael's mentor, demanded the Judges order Ka-in, protege of\nhis rival Ninurta, executed. But Marduk's father Enki revealed he,\nEnki, was Ka-in's grandfather, so Ka-in is Marduk's grandnephew.\nEnki told Marduk that Ka-in's survival was critical to generate\ngenetically superior Earthling laborers for field, pasture and\nmines \"If Ka-in too shall be extinguished, satiation [of food\nsupplies] to an end would come, mutinies will be repeated.\"\n\nThe Seven ruled \"Eastward to a land of wandering for his evil\ndeed Ka-in must depart. Eastward to a land of wandering for his evil\ndeed Ka-in must depart\".Ka-in and \"his generations shall be\ndistinguished\" By Ningishzidda was the life essence [genotype] of Ka-\nin altered: his face a beard could not grow***.....With his sister\nAwan as a spouse Ka-in from the Edin departed.\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002,\nThe Lost Book of Enki, pages 186 - 187].\n\nThey wandered in the wilderness to the east. When Adapa was\non his deathbed, Ninurta fetched Ka-in to Edin in his\nrocketship. \"The eyesight of Adapa having failed, for recognition of\nhis sons' faces he touched. The face of Ka-in was beardless\" Adapa\ntold Ka-in, \"For your sin of your birthright you are deprived, but of\nyour seed seven nations will come. In a realm set apart they shall\nthrive, distant lands they shall inhabit. But having your brother\nwith a stone killed, by a stone will be your end.\" Ninurta returned\nKa-in to the wilds east of Edin where \"in a distant realm Ka-in had\nsons and daughters\" Ninurta, \"for them a city [Nud, also called Dun,\nDunnu and Nu.dun] built, and as he was building, by a falling stone\nwas he [Ka-in] killed.**** They planted grain and founded and ruled\nthe city of Nud (Ka-in's successors for the next four generations\nwere murdered by their sons. For the next three generations, each\nruler of Nud ascended to rule after marrying his sister and murdering\nhis parents.\n\nKa-in's son's son's son (great grandson), Enoch, who succeeded Ka-in\nin the fourth generation of Ka-in's descendents, married two of his\nown sisters, Adah and Zillah. One of Adah's sons, Jabal, and his\nfollowers lived in tents and raised cattle. Jabal's brother Jubal,\nbegat a line of musicans who played lyre and flute music. Lamech's\nother wife, Zillah, bore Tubal-Cain, who was a smith, \"an artificer\nof gold, copper and iron.\" [Sitchin, Z., 1885, The Wars of Gods and\nMen pages111 -112; 2002,The Lost Book of Enki:, pages 181-193].\n\nADAPA AND TITI'S OTHER PROGENY AND THEIR ISSUE\n\nAdapa left behind the descendants of thirty sons and thirty\ndaughters he and Titi begat. Adapa's descendants divided these\ngenetic descendants of Enki among them as proteges and taught them\nwriting, mathematics, well-digging, body oil preparation, harp and\nflute mastery and the preparation of elixir of the Inbu fruits.\nAdapa's descendants were also taught how to use bitumens for furnaces\nfor gold smelting and refining. Enlil's son, Nannar, taught them\nceremonies to worship their Nibiran lords. \"Of the rites of worship\nof the Anunnaki [Those who from Sky Descended, i.e., Nibirans] that\nthe beginning was.\"\nThe hybrids the Nibirans taught each identified with their respective\nNibiran teachers. Enki taught astronomy to one of his hybrid\ndescendants, Enkime. Enki's son Marduk rocketed Enkime to the Moon\nand Marsbase, then sent him to the spaceport at Sippar, to be Prince\nof Earthlings under Nannar's son, Utu\/Shamash, who was in charge\nthere. Lu-Mach, a descendant of Enkime, was appointed workmaster of\nthe Earthlings in Edin, \"the quotas to enforce, the rations to\nreduce.\" But \"in his days conditions on Earth became harsher; the\ntoilers in field and meadow raised complaints\" [Sitchin, Z., 1885,\nThe Wars of Gods and Men pages 111 -112; 2002,The Lost Book of Enki:,\npages 188-193].\n\nClimatic, magnetic and astronomical disruptions damaged\nMarsbase and forced the Anunnaki leaders, Enki, Ninmah and Enlil, to\nmeet. Face-to-face, they worried that they, unlike the other\ncolonists who rotated from Nibiru, were aging. Enki observed \"Old on\nEarth we became, but those on Earth born are even older sooner.\"\n\nTo deal with the celestial crisis, the leaders sent Ninurta,\nthe son of Enlil and Ninmah \"to the Land Beyond the Seas [Andes?] in\nthe mountainland a Bond Heaven-Earth [transmission tower] to\nestablish.\" They sent Ninurta's rival, Enki's son Marduk, to\nevaluate damage at Marsbase. They told the rulers of South Africa,\nEnki's son Nergal and Nergal's wife Ereshkigal (Enlil's son\nNannar\/Sin's daughter) to run new instruments at Africa's south tip\n[Cape Agulhas?] to monitor the space and Earth disturbances.\n[Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 195]\n\nMarduk told his parents he wanted to marry an Earthling,\nSarpanit, daughter of Marduk's Earthling protg, Enkime (a\ndescendant of Enki's partially-Earthling son, Adapa). Marduk's\nmother, Ninti, warned Marduk that if he married Sarpanit \"to Nibiru\nwith his spouse he would never go. His princely rights on Nibiru he\nforever will forsake. To this Marduk with a bitter laugh responded:\nMy rights on Nibiru are nonexixtent. Even on Earth my rights as\nfirstborn have been trampled\" [by Enlil and his heir, Ninurta, who\nwere given Earth commands]. Marduk vowed to become master of Earth.\n\nFurious, Enlil beamed Anu on Nibiru stop Marduk and Sarpanit\nfrom marrying. Anu and his counselors ruled, \" On Nibiru Adapa, the\nmaiden's progenitor could not stay....Therefore to return to Nibiru\nwith her, Marduk must forever be be barred.... Marduk marry can, but\non Nibiru a prince he shall no more be.\" Enlil let Marduk and\nSarpanit announce their wedding at Eridu, Enki's place on the Persian\nGulf. But Enlil also ordered that Marduk and Sarpnit, after their\nwedding would be banished to his own domain, Egypt, within Enki's\nsphere of influence (Abzu\/Africa). \"A great multitude of Civilized\nEarthlings in Eridu assembled,.... Young Anunnaki [Nibiran Colonists\nand their pure progeny], Igigi from Lahmu [Mars] in great numbers\ncame\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 198 - 199] , using\nMarduk's wedding as an opportunity to assemble as part of their plan\nto capture brides of their own.\n\nASTRONAUTS ABDUCT EARTH BRIDES AT MARDUK'S WEDDING, THREATEN EARTH'S\nDESTRUCTION UNLESS ANUNNAKI LEADERS RATIFY THEIR UNIONS WITH THE\nWOMEN\n\n200 Igigi-- astronauts-- occupied the landing platform in\nLebanon (the Cedar Mountains), then flew to Edin and mix with the\ncrowd of Adapa's descendants and Nibiran colonists at Marduk's\nwedding. After the ceremony, each astronaut seized one Earthling\nmaiden. They took the 200 women back to Lebanon and \"into a\nstronghold the place they made, to the leaders a challenge they\nissued...'The Adapite daughters to marry we wish. Your blessing to\nthis you must give, else by fire all on Earth destroy we will.\"\n[Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 201]\n\nMarduk, who commanded the Igigi, championed their abduction\nmarriages. Enlil fumed; \"In his heart things against Marduk and his\nEarthlings was Enlil plotting.\" Marduk settled some of the Igigi and\ntheir half-Nibiran, half--Adapite issue (\"Children of the Rocketships\nthey were called\") in Babylon; he and Sarpanit stayed with others in\nLebanon. By 100,000 years ago, some of these \"Children of the\nRocketships\" settled in \"the far eastlands, lands of high\nmountains.\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 202; 1985,\nThe Wars of Gods and Men: 346]\n\nEnlil ordered his successor Ninurta to counter the spread of\nMarduk's Earthlings. \"'The Earth by Earthlings inherited will be,'\nEnlil to Ninurta said. 'Go, the offspring of Ka-in find, with them a\ndomain of your own prepare'\" To counter Marduk's threat, Ninurta\nrecruited the descendants of Ka-in. He showed them how to build\nbalsam rafts. They crossed the seas to the Western Hemisphere, where\nNinurta taught them tin and gold mining, smelting and refining.\n[Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 203]\n\nENKI BEGATS NOAH\n\nEnki lusted for Batanash, wife of his son Adapa's descendant,\nLu-Mach, Workmaster of Earthlings in Edin. Enlil had ordered Lu-\nMach to enforce work quotas and reduce rations for the Earthlings he\ndirected. The Earthlings grumbled and they threatened Lu-Mach. Enki\nsent Lu-March to Marduk in Babylon to learn city-building and sent\nBatanash to Ninmah at the Medical\/Science complex of Shurubak, \"from\nthe angry Earthling masses protected and safe to be. Thereafter Enki\nhis sister Ninmah in Shurubak was quick to visit. On the roof of a\ndwelling where Batanash was bathing Enki by her loins took hold, he\nkissed her, his semen into her womb he poured.\" From this encounter,\nshe bore Ziusudra (Noah).\n\nWhen Lu-Mach returned to Edin, \"to him Batanash the son\nshowed. White as the snow his skin was.... Like the skies were his\neyes, in a brilliance his eyes were shining.\" Lu-Mach complained, \"A\nson unlike an Earthling to Batanash was born.... Is one of the Igigi\nhis father?\" Batanash swore \"None of the Igigi is the boy's father.\"\nLu-Mach's father Matushal assured him Ziusudra was destined to help\nEarhlings survive the Ice Age Earth was entering.\n\nWhile Ninmah loved and cared for Ziusudra and Enki taught him to read\nAdapa's writings, drought, plague and starvation stalked the\nEarthlings. [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 204 -205]\nEnki and Ninmah proposed teaching Earthlings medicine for plague, sea-\nfishing and pond and canal building for drought and famine.\n\nEnlil (Yahweh), however, was still enraged at Enki for\ncreating the Earthling hybrids. Enlil was also furious at Enki's son\nMarduk, who was recruiting the hybrid line descended from the the\ndaughters of Adapa whom the astronauts had abducted at Marduk's\nwedding to the Earthling Sarpanit. Marduk was conditioning this\nhybrid population to serve him for the time when he and the\nastronauts who had taken hybrid women must remain on Earth, the time\nwhen enough gold had been sent to Nibiru to shield the homeplanet's\natmosphere and the other Nibirans would return home. So Enlil\nforbade any help for the Earthlings. \"Let the Earthlings by hunger\nand pestilence perish,\" decreed Enlil. To speed the demise of the\nEarthlings, Enlil specifically ordered Enki to block Earthlings'\naccess to ocean fish.\n\nThe Earthlings at Shurubak, where Ziusudra lived under Enki\nand Ninmah's tutilage, sent Ziusudra to Enki for help. Enki\nsuggested the Earthlings protest Enlil's anti-Earthling policy and\nboycott worship of and service to their Nibiran lords, but said he\ncouldn't openly ignore Enlil's order and help the Earthlings.\n\nCovertly, however, Enki fed Earthlings from his corn stores,\ntrained them in sea fishing and gave them access to the sea. When\nEnlil accused Enki of defying his decree that humans be allowed to\nperish, Enki lied. He said the humans acted without his knowledge.\nEnlil planned for the final destruction of Earthlings and the end to\nNibiran occupation of Earth [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of\nEnki: 206; 1978, The 12th Planet, pages 292 -294].\n\nEach 3,600 year revolution of Nibiru to the region of Solaris\ncreated ever more violent disturbances on Nibiru, the sun (huge solar\nflares) Mars (Lahmu) and Earth. On Earth, Nergal reported from the\nsouth tip of Africa that the Antarctic ice sheet was sliding to the\nocean and would, next approach of Nibiru, slide into the sea and\ncause wave reverberations that would engulf most of Earth.\n\nGALZU KEEPS ANUNNAKI LEADERS ON MISSION EARTH\n\nAnu and the Counsel on Nibiru beamed Earth: \"'For evacuating\nEarth and Lahmu prepare.' In the Abzu [Zimbabwe] the gold mines shut\ndown; therefrom the Anunnaki [colonists on Earth from Nibiru] to the\nEdin came; ... smelting and refining ceased, all gold to Nibiru was\nlofted. Empty, for evacuating ready, a fleet of celestial chariots\n[interplanetary spaceships] to Earth returned.\" One spaceship\nbrought the mysterious white-haired Galzu (Great Knower) with a\nsealed message from Anu to Enki, Enlil and Ninmah [Sitchin, Z.,\n2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 208].\n\n\"Enlil the seal of Anu examined; unbroken and authentic it\nwas, its encoding trustworthy. 'For King and Council Galzu speaks.\nhis words are my commands.' So did the message of Anu state. 'I am\nGalzu, Emissary Plenipoteniary of King and Council, to Enlil,'\" he\nsaid.\n\nPlenipoteniary Galzu summonsed Enlil's elder sister and\nbrother, Ninmah and Enki. Galzu told Ninmah, \"'Of the same school and\nage we are.' This Ninmah could not recall: the emissary was as young\nas a son, she was as his olden mother.\" Galzu told Ninmah she aged\nand he hadn't because she'd been so long on Earth. She and her\nbrothers had been on Earth so long that they'd die if they returned\nto Nibiru, where their bodies could not survive the homeplanet's\nnetforce.\n\n\"The three of you on Earth will remain; only to die to Nibiru\nyou will return.\" Ninmah and her brothers must orbit Earth in their\nrockets when the antarctic icesheet slipped into the ocean and waves\nwashed over the planet. When the waters calmed, the Leaders were to\nreturn to Earth, the only place they could survive.\n\nKing Anu's order continued, \"To each of the other Anunnaki, a\nchoice to leave or the calamity outwait must be given. The Igigi\n[astronauts] who Earthlings espoused must between departure and\nspouses choose. No Earthling, Marduk's Sarpanit included, to Nibiru\nto journey is allowed. For all who stay and what happens see, in\ncelestial chariots they safety must seek.\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The\nLost Book of Enki: 209 - 211].\n\nEnlil convened the Anunnaki Council, which consisted of the\nLeaders' sons and grandchildren and the Igigi commanders. He said he\ndecided the Earthlings must drown in the deluge.\n\nEnki protested, \"'A wonderous Being by us was created, by us\nsaved it must be,' Enki to Enlil shouted.'\"\n\nEnlil roared back,\"'To Primitive Workers you gave to them\nknowing you endowed. The powers of the Creator of All into your hands\nyou have taken. With fornication Adapa you conceived , Understanding\nto his line you gave. His offspring to the heavens you have taken,\nour wisdom with them you shared. Every rule you have broken,\ndecisions and commands you ignored. Because of you a Civilized\nEarthling brother [Abael] a brother [Ka-in] murdered. Because of\nMarduk your son the Igigi like him with Earthlings intermarried.'\"\n\nEnlil demanded Enki and all swear not to tell the Earthlings\nof the impending inundation. Enki refused; he and Marduk stamped out\nof the Council. But Enki was still reluctant to openly defy Enlil.,\nwho, after all, had drawn command of Earth Mission [Sitchin, Z.,\n2002, The Lost Book of Enki: 212 -214].\n\nEnlil brought the Council back to order. Astronauts with\nAdapite wives and children, he decreed, must move to the peaks above\nwave level. When the deluge engulfed Earth, repatriating colonists\nwould rocket to Nibiru. \"On Earth shall Enki, Ninmah, and I--as well\nas our sons, daughters and their descendants--will orbit Earth till\nthe Earthlings drown and the waters recede.\".\n\nIn preparation for the flood, Enki and Ninmah buried their\nrecords and computer programs deep in the Iraqi soil. They prepared\ngenetic banks of Earth's creatures to save from coming flood. \"Male\nand female essences and life-eggs they collected, of each kind two by\ntwo ... they collected for safekeeping while in Earth circuit to be\ntaken, thereafter the living kinds to recombine. The day of the\ndeluge they waited.\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki:\n216].\n\nGALZU HELPS ENKI SAVE ZIUSUDRA & EARTHLINGS\n\nThe Story: Enlil, Earth's Nibiran Commander, convened the\nAnunnaki Council, the leaders' sons and grandchildren and the Igigi\nastronaut commanders. He ordered all to conceal news of the deluge\nto come from the Earthlings who, he ruled, must drown. He warned\nastronauts with Adapite wives and descendants to flee to the peaks\nabove the flood. \"Colonists will repatriate to Nibiru while Enki,\nNinmah and your Commander, I Enlil, our kids and grandchildren will\norbit till the Earthlings are exterminated in the waters.\"\n\nEnki dreamed Galzu said \"Into your hands Fate take, for the\nEarthlings the Earth inherit. Summon your son Ziusudra, without\nbreaking the oath [swearing not to tell humans] to him the coming\ncalamity reveal. A boat that the watery avalanche can withstand, a\nsubmersible one, to build him tell, the likes of which on this tablet\nto you I am showing. Let him in it save himself and his kinfolk and\nthe seed of all that is useful, be it plant or animal, also take.\nThat is the will of the Creator of All.\"\n\nEnki woke and pondered his dream. When he got out of bed,\nmuch to his amazement, he kicked an actual tablet-- where none had\nbeen before he slept--next to his bed. He searched his home and\ngrounds for Galzu but Galzu's was not there, nor had anyone seen him,\nexcept Enki, in the dream.\n\nThe appearance of the tablet--a physical object--following a\ndream or trance encounter with a representative of a higher power--\nGalzu in this instance-- is what Sitchin calls a Twightlight Zone\nmiracle.\n\n\"That night to the reed hut where Ziusudra was sleeping Enki\nstealthily went. The oath not breaking, the lord Enki not to Ziusudra\nbut to the hut's wall [computer bank?] spoke from behind the reed\nwall. When Ziusudra by the words was awakened, to him Enki\nsaid, \"Reed hut, a calamitous storm will sweep, the destruction of\nMankind it will be. This is the decision of the assembly by Enlil\nconvened. 'Abandon thy house, build a boat. Its design and\nmeasurements on a tablet....A boatguide [Enki's son, Ninagal] to you\nwill come. To a safe haven the boatguide will navigate you. By you\nshall the seed of Civilized Man survive. Not to you Ziusudra, have I\nspoken, but to the reed wall did I speak.'\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The\nLost Book of Enki: abridged from pages 220 -222]\n\n13,000 years ago, \"in the Whiteland, at the Earth's bottom,\noff its foundation, the [Antarctic] icesheet slipped. By Nibiru's\nnetforce it was pulled into the south sea. A tidal wave arose,\nnorthward spreading. The boat of Ziusudra the tidal wave from its\nmoorings lifted. Though completely submerged, not a drop of water\ninto it did enter. For forty days, waves and storms swept Earth,\ndowning everything on the planet except those on mountaintops and in\nZiusudra's boat\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki: abridged\nfrom page 227].\n\nSurfacing, Ningal raised sail and steered to Mt Arrata, where\nZiusudra built a huge fire as a signal and roasted lamb as an\noffering to Enki. Enki and Enlil descended in helicopters\n(Whirlwinds) from their rocketships. \"When Enlil the survivors saw,\nNingal among them, \"`Every Earthling had to perish, he with fury\nshouted'; at Enki with anger he lunged, to kill his brother with bare\nhands he was ready.\" Ningal radioed Ninmah and Ninurta to bring\ntheir copters down quick.\n\n\"`He is no mere mortal, my son he is,' Enki to Ziusudra\npointing. `To a reed wall I spoke, not Ziusudra' Enki said.\" Enki,\njoined by Ninmah and Ninurta, revealed his dream vision. He told\nEnlil of the instructions and tablet Galzu gave him. Together, Enki,\nNinurta and Nimah convinced Enlil \"The survival of mankind the will\nof the Creator of All must be.\" [Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book\nof Enki: abridged from pages 228 - 229].\n\n* Sitchin, Z., 2002, The Lost Book of Enki, 1976, The 12th Planet;\n1980, The Stairway to Heaven; 1985, The Wars of Gods and Men; 1990,\nGenesis Revisited; 1990, The Lost Realms; 1993, When Time Began;\n1995, Divine Encounters; 1998, The Cosmic Code; Freer, N., 2000,\nBreaking the Godspell.
