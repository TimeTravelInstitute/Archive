<br />
Copy begins&gt;<br />
There are TWO forthcoming events - one certain, one possible - that have been confused in many published reports because they have not been fully understood, therefore our article originally published in 1993 has been rewritten and expanded in an effort to dispel many misconceptions of what is really going on. Either of these events is sure to create PANIC amongst the general population, therefore it is important to be prepared and lessen the impact on yourself and your family or riends. <br />
<br />
Event No 1 - Entry into the Photon Belt <br />
<br />
Our solar system journeys through the universe in a 26,200 year cycle, its path crossing what is popularly termed the Milky Way at right angles twice during that period. Every 13,000 years or so therefore planet Earth comes into a space/time overlap or period of NULL-TIME ..... an electromagnetic no-zone or energy vacuum, with complete absence of electromagnetic fields and the temporary suspension of the planetary grid system. When the pendulum reaches the destructive pause at the end of its swing, this is one of the results. This cosmic cloud is called the PHOTON Belt, the Milky Way or Monasic* Ring, and ushers in an era of Light (2,000 years of Enlightenment) after a much longer period of [biblical] darkness. We are now poised to enter this Photon Belt, and there is nothing we can do to avoid it. It is the ending of a cycle. Understand it without fearing it. <br />
<br />
UPDATE: Summer 2002<br />
Our latest information is that a way has been made for the planet to enter this Photon Belt (we are well into it right now, apparently) with protection against these negative possibilities, however, we leave this record as it was in case the information we now have is faulty ........ There are powers that control the outcome, and they seem to have stepped in to do so. <br />
<br />
[* a Sanskrit word meaning the faculty of mental perception that receives impressions from the senses and transmits them to the soul ('Atman')] <br />
<br />
Electrons are neutralised during this period and therefore the laws of electricity lapse - there will be absolutely NO electrical activity during this period, not even from batteries. The effects will be far-reaching. <br />
<br />
To fully comprehend the situation it is necessary to have an understanding of electricity, light and its function and projection. <br />
<br />
For those who truly understand physics (a la Walter Russell), a space/time overlap is when electromagnetic-magnetohydrodynamic changes begin to take place prior to or just before entering this null-zone and this moves what we might call the Life Zone of gravitational compression into a larger graviton spectrum. It will let your mind adapt more easily to a new frequency, this new type of light coming in, and it's going to allow you a much lighter compression so that you can come into knowing and more understanding much more easily. The final process of the time/space overlap will be an interfacing of two evolutionary structures. This is a touching or integration in some experiences between this third and fourth dimension of experience and an experience of the fifth. <br />
<br />
Our solar system is moving into a new position in the universe, and in so doing traverses this Photon Belt. The stars will appear to &quot;fall from the sky&quot; - as we pass them by, for it is our solar system which is moving, not these stars. The following 2,000 years represent an era of &quot;Light&quot; - no night-time as we know it, as well as the next Ice-Age (but this latter change will be gradual, not instantaneous). We will be pulled more into the orbiting system of Pleiades where we shall have at least two suns. <br />
<br />
Reports on this subject appeared in 1962, 1981 and 1992, and came from both traditional scientific sources (space research) as well as the oral traditions of Australian aboriginals, the Mayans and the North American Indians. Its influence began to be felt upon this planet as early as 1962 as we entered the fringes of the Photon Belt. This time period also heralded a period of great &quot;UFO&quot; activity. Entry into the Photon Belt has always been associated with ease of space travel - historically, space travellers arrived during the era of passage through the Photon Belt, or Earth inhabitants moved on. <br />
<br />
By the early '90s the effects began to be much more noticeable, and polaroid photographs often produced unexpected 'sparkles' of light - the result of photons or gamma rays being picked up as they infiltrated the earth's atmosphere. <br />
<br />
The Photon Belt was known prior to this, of course, but the information was not released for public consumption. There are many references to it in ancient texts, including the Bible. Very little real knowledge is permitted to filter down to the masses. Check for instance The Book of Revelation ..... &quot;There will be no sun, moon or stars.&quot; <br />
<br />
The &quot;Ozone Hole&quot; problem and alleged effect of ultraviolet rays is in fact a cover-up of the dangers which entry into this Photon Belt presents - these photons are invisible penetrating rays of light which can be extremely damaging, just like X-rays. <br />
<br />
Earth will be a place created for those who make the transition, and this is most likely to happen during the null-zone, when everyone is responding to the correct vibration frequency so that it will be easier for the armada of more evolved beings to lift us from this planet to the more beautifully created place where we will have more balance and harmony to continue - ie, in the fourth dimension. Some of us, on a higher level of understanding, will go to a higher dimension than the fourth. Those who do not make the transition will experience death of the physical body; those who do will have a much lighter (less dense) physical body. <br />
<br />
Because of the reduced solar radiation the temperature can be expected to become cooler and ice-caps will extend to a lattitude of about 40 degrees in both hemispheres - this is why recorded 'Ice'Ages' seem to last 2,000 years. It is interesting to note that the world communication centres and fixed satellites, U.S. military bases and experimental sightings are within the 'safe' zone. Note however that, as the earth is supposed to 'slurp to one side' the current position of lands should be quite different at that time, so it cannot be said that these places WILL be in a 'safe' zone. Read the works of Edgar Cayce and others regarding future climates in North America and elsewhere. The poles will be quite far from their present positions. <br />
<br />
Timing <br />
<br />
As this Belt is continually contracting and expanding, it is rather difficult to be specific about the exact timing of the event. There were reports in 1992 that this could take place in July of that year, but the information stemmed from government sources, who were deliberately confusing the issue. A satellite was to be released at that time to set alight the Van Allen Belts, which encircle our planet, where nuclear radiation from Earth had accumulated, causing a similar effect [see Event No 2]. <br />
<br />
The most likely date for this event is towards the close of the millenium. As it appears to be connected to the transition from the third to fourth dimension, the period 1999 to 2001 is a probable point in time - by that time the Earth's population may be only a fraction of what it is today, due to depopulation, therefore many of the problems foreseen and outlined here in the Guidelines for action will not be applicable as our present economic, political and spiritual state will have been drastically altered by then. [May 2001: there have been changes to the planned timing: currently it is estimated by scientists as August 2003: the Schumann Resonance, the earth's heartbeat, used to be 8.8 - it is now 12.1 - and when it reaches 13 .... the Null or Zero Point is reached.] <br />
<br />
Following this event will be 40 years without rain. Nostradamus said of the year 1999: &quot;and it will rain no more, but in 40 years, it will be normal.&quot; Now we have a more definite sense of timing. <br />
<br />
According to Eric von Daniken in his book Chariots of the Gods, there is a tribe in South America which was given an object by the 'Sky People' thousands of years ago. They were to keep this object clean, listen to it and ..... when it hums like a thousand swarms of bees we will be returning, they said. This cosmic alarm clock started humming about 1978. <br />
<br />
Effect of Entry <br />
<br />
There are TWO possible scenarios. <br />
<br />
Should Earth reach this PHOTON Belt before our Sun does, the sky will appear to be on fire and there would be three days and three nights of blinding light. Welders' goggles would be needed to protect eyes from this light, as it would burn out the retinal nerves, and this would continue for 110 - 120 hours. This is a cold light, therefore there would be no heat. But there could be radiation, so one should remain indoors. <br />
<br />
If the Sun reaches the Belt first there will be a similar period of immediate and total darkness, without the sun rising. All molecules will become excited and atomic structures will change at this point in time and all life-forms will have a certain luminescence about them, creating their own light system. <br />
<br />
Signs of the approach of the Photon Belt are said to be strange lighting effects or colors in the sky, a perception of less light - even in midsummer, and a gradual darkening of the planet itself, with final entry into total darkness taking 15 - 20 minutes. <br />
<br />
Some plane crashes and 'balls of lightning' can be attributed to or result from these particles of blinding light. Likewise, many instances of cities going off the grid, electricity shutdown, radar system malfunctions (at airports, for instance) stem from entry into the fringes of the Photon Belt. [Often they are man-made ] <br />
<br />
The Earth's grid system will be nullified (this is a natural energy pattern which criss-crosses the globe - and is used by both military and extra-terrestrial craft). There will also be tremendous physical jolting, which will cause earthquakes and other geophysical events, consequently destroying communications, including transportation, which will in turn create food and other shortages. <br />
<br />
Living creatures will feel a jolt of energy upon entry into the belt, and many physical bodies will not stand up to this electrical charge. It will be akin to putting one's finger in a live light socket. There are three types of bodies on this planet - corporeal, atmospherian and etherian: this will be our change from corporeal to atmospherian, for those who are ready and can take it. It will happen as stated in the Bible - 'Ye shall be changed to immortality without the separation of death in the twinkling of an eye.&quot; Animal life will react by early hibernation. <br />
<br />
It is interesting to note the biblical reference to THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS OF DARKNESS. We can find no reference in any ancient or modern text to the people of Earth being permanently blinded, and for this reason we would infer that preparation should be for total darkness rather than blinding light. But it might be wise to have these welders' goggles available as a precautionary measure, as there are other dangers. [see Event No.2] <br />
<br />
Photon energy is the energy of the future. It was being used in the early '90s for high-speed transportation in the form of the AURORA aircraft, which flies at close to the speed of light, and is completely silent in flight. This was covered in the May 1993 issue of Popular Science as well as elsewhere, but whether it was American or Russian in origin was still a question. <br />
<br />
Event No.2 - Ignition of the Van Allen Belt <br />
<br />
Scientists had warned that, if nuclear testing did not end by the early '80s, radiation would commence to fall back down on earth by the year 1993. Someone had the 'bright' idea of resolving the matter by burning up this radiation by using linear beam weapons. Fortunately the satellite despatched to do this in July 1992 failed just thirty minutes before ignition time. [Intervention by Higher Powers..... ] <br />
<br />
If this experiment had succeeded, the light would have been so intense that no-one would have been able to go out of doors for three days unless they wore welders' goggles, and there would be massive blindness everywhere on the planet. Many people did in fact purchase welders' goggles at that time (and they may still be necessary, as further similar attempts are made). <br />
<br />
In May 1992 it was reported that an army of satellites had been launched in order to drain-off photons from the Photon belt, and thereby delay entry, but again this appears to have been a cover-up of the activities referred to above. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UPDATE: February 2003<br />
&quot;There are many darkside rumors concerning the fate of the Columbia Space Shuttle on February 1st. The Columbia mission was one of very evil intent. The Shuttle was carrying a payload of a very powerful nuclear bomb intended to be detonated to start Nuclear World War III. Using scalar technology the Forces of Light imploded the nuclear bomb, disintegrated the shuttle craft, and neutralized the radio-active fall-out. Had the bomb exploded as intended, the explosion would have ignited the Van Allen belt, a protective layer of intense radiation particles that surrounds our earth. The light from such an ignition would have caused immediate blindness to all people whose eyes were unprotected. The result of this explosion would have burned the entire surface of our planet and left it looking like planet Mars. Our evil government and other world controllers planned to be in their underground cities when this occurred. &quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
Guidelines for action<br />
when EARTH meets the PHOTON BELT<br />
or<br />
the VAN ALLEN BELT is ignited<br />
[Hopefully you will have to hang on to these instructions for quite some time yet!]<br />
To counter the effect of this brilliant light (either from entry into the Photon Belt or ignition of the Van Allen Belt) one should obtain welders' goggles fitted with a #15 lens - this may be difficult to obtain, therefore we recommend rectangular flip-front goggles with the standard #5 lens plus an extra #10 lens which can be added on top of the existing lens to give adequate protection. This then gives a clear view with the front flipped up; and affords protection when lowered. <br />
<br />
Prior to anticipated date, ventilate well all rooms in the residence or office as OXYGEN is of prime importance. Remove possible pollutants and do not plan to carry out painting or redecoration work around this time. Keep welders' goggles handy, at home or in the office, as well as a headache remedy. <br />
<br />
Should an increase in the intensity of daylight be noticed, immediately darken all windows in the house after first putting on welders' goggles with the dark lens flipped upwards, so that one can still see clearly indoors. Retreat to the centre of the building, or below ground-level. At this point everyone should be confined to the building. <br />
<br />
With the total failure of electricity, public services will fail - communications, telephone, water and power are dependent upon electricity - as are gas pumps, public lighting, radio and TV. One must be entirely independent - and isolated. The confusion and lack of services will continue well beyond the 120 hour period: prepare for at least ONE WEEK of emergency operations. Illumination will be limited to propane lamps or candlelight (see Note 8 below). <br />
<br />
Cancel all travel plans for that time period - air, sea and land transportation systtems ALL depend upon electricity. Automobiles are dependent too upon an electrical battery (even when the fuel tank is FULL!) and will cease to function, creating chaos on the streets. The only means of transportation will be a bicycle - but even it will have no possible means of illumination (remember, TOTAL darkness prevails) other than propane or candlelight. <br />
<br />
[A similar effect was experienced in the State of Utah on July 18th, 1994, when all traffic stopped on Interstate 15 near Farmington, a northern suburb of Salt Lake City, except for an older vehicle - without electronic ignition (prior to 1983) - which weaved its way past all other stalled vehicles: but if its battery had failed, it would have suffered the same fate. It was reported that at that particular moment four helicopters were seen hovering over the freeway: when vehicles restarted about an hour later, these same helicopters were seen flying off in formation, so this was obviously a high level experiment. This is the same effect as a UFO has when it approaches a vehicle.] <br />
<br />
[We should also mention another event which would permanently disable all electronic systems: EMP or electromagnetic pulse - the result of the above-ground burst of a neutron bomb.] <br />
<br />
KEEP OFF THE STREETS!! Plan a program at home which will keep everyone as occupied as possible for at least three days. There could be widespread activity during this period which would affect the public in general. Darkness can also be a time for dark deeds. This could vary from political activity to criminal acts, so security should be a high priority. In the case of blinding light, many will still move around - blinded by rage - and will be dangerous. <br />
<br />
Ensure premises are secure at all times. Security systems will not be working. This is prime time for vandalism and crime in general, so ensure that one has a means of identifying without any shadow of a doubt who might be at the door - or play it safe and allow NO ENTRY whatsoever. Let close friends know of the arrangement. <br />
<br />
The complete lack of heat should not be an insurmountable problem unless the event occurs in winter, and should be overcome with extra clothing. Bodies also give off some heat. It has not been accurately projected what the effect would be of three days without normal daytime (solar) heating, but assume that there will be a considerable drop in temperature. Ensure nevertheless that there is ALWAYS an adequate supply of fresh air, despite any cold. Woodstoves would be most advantageous for both heating and cooking, if a supply of fuel is readily available. Be sure to check or extinguish open fires before going to sleep. <br />
<br />
Light and heat can be supplied by candles but it is more important to note that most candles give off undesirable fumes. Ensure that what you use are 100% beeswax candles. Propane or butane can be used in a well-ventilated area for lighting, cooking and heating purposes, but one might be well-advised to do without cooked foods over this period. <br />
<br />
NOTE: Pure beeswax candles are non-allergenic, burn 20 to 30 times longer than traditional</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">Ok... Ive being studying alot on this 'photon belt' business. On many different sites, their information is varyied, and in some cases it contradicts. One site is saying it will bring the death and destruction of all life on earth, when the polar ice caps melt, and cover the earth, the earth will be cleansed. <br />
<br />
Another is saying 'Dont be scared, it will only 'awaken' your metaphysical and spiritual abilities, and only those who can accept the light, and who are not corrupted by greed and hate will evolve, and live, and others will implode and die.&quot; <br />
<br />
Im struggling to comprehend this anicdote. I dont know what it is, some sources are trying to explain it in a spiritual, others in a scientific, but all different sources are very inconsistent.  Information is always altered, one site said we entered the belt in 1988, another said we entered it in 2003, another sayin we are going to enter it in 2004. And when different sources are saying different things about one topic, it starts to get fishy.. <br />
<br />
It's scary stuff though... Especially the part where it says the human existence will come to an end, and the cycle will repeat. But it does make sense, cause every thing runs in order, in a cycle, everything is in a circle. There is no ending, it goes for ever, it repeats etc...<br />
<br />
However, I dont really have an opinion on it, i guess if it happens it happens.</div>

Advice:When you're up there, your singing infront of people who really,..... in some cases want to hear what you're singing.<br />
<br />
They want to hear what you are, what you're singing about.You can't hold back.<br />
<br />
You've got to sing the very best that you know how, you've got to give it your best and blow their socks off!.<br />
<br />
This is the hallmark of a very good singer, or musician.</div>

			"articleBody": "Photon belt story, us link, due to storrage space at TTI, not full article:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.geocities.com\/newageinternational\/PhotonBelt.html\n\nEd Note;Not the full article, use link at this time period:\n\nCopy begins>\nThere are TWO forthcoming events - one certain, one possible - that have been confused in many published reports because they have not been fully understood, therefore our article originally published in 1993 has been rewritten and expanded in an effort to dispel many misconceptions of what is really going on. Either of these events is sure to create PANIC amongst the general population, therefore it is important to be prepared and lessen the impact on yourself and your family or riends. \n\nEvent No 1 - Entry into the Photon Belt \n\nOur solar system journeys through the universe in a 26,200 year cycle, its path crossing what is popularly termed the Milky Way at right angles twice during that period. Every 13,000 years or so therefore planet Earth comes into a space\/time overlap or period of NULL-TIME ..... an electromagnetic no-zone or energy vacuum, with complete absence of electromagnetic fields and the temporary suspension of the planetary grid system. When the pendulum reaches the destructive pause at the end of its swing, this is one of the results. This cosmic cloud is called the PHOTON Belt, the Milky Way or Monasic* Ring, and ushers in an era of Light (2,000 years of Enlightenment) after a much longer period of [biblical] darkness. We are now poised to enter this Photon Belt, and there is nothing we can do to avoid it. It is the ending of a cycle. Understand it without fearing it. \n\nUPDATE: Summer 2002\nOur latest information is that a way has been made for the planet to enter this Photon Belt (we are well into it right now, apparently) with protection against these negative possibilities, however, we leave this record as it was in case the information we now have is faulty ........ There are powers that control the outcome, and they seem to have stepped in to do so. \n\n[* a Sanskrit word meaning the faculty of mental perception that receives impressions from the senses and transmits them to the soul ('Atman')] \n\nElectrons are neutralised during this period and therefore the laws of electricity lapse - there will be absolutely NO electrical activity during this period, not even from batteries. The effects will be far-reaching. \n\nTo fully comprehend the situation it is necessary to have an understanding of electricity, light and its function and projection. \n\nFor those who truly understand physics (a la Walter Russell), a space\/time overlap is when electromagnetic-magnetohydrodynamic changes begin to take place prior to or just before entering this null-zone and this moves what we might call the Life Zone of gravitational compression into a larger graviton spectrum. It will let your mind adapt more easily to a new frequency, this new type of light coming in, and it's going to allow you a much lighter compression so that you can come into knowing and more understanding much more easily. The final process of the time\/space overlap will be an interfacing of two evolutionary structures. This is a touching or integration in some experiences between this third and fourth dimension of experience and an experience of the fifth. \n\nOur solar system is moving into a new position in the universe, and in so doing traverses this Photon Belt. The stars will appear to \"fall from the sky\" - as we pass them by, for it is our solar system which is moving, not these stars. The following 2,000 years represent an era of \"Light\" - no night-time as we know it, as well as the next Ice-Age (but this latter change will be gradual, not instantaneous). We will be pulled more into the orbiting system of Pleiades where we shall have at least two suns. \n\nReports on this subject appeared in 1962, 1981 and 1992, and came from both traditional scientific sources (space research) as well as the oral traditions of Australian aboriginals, the Mayans and the North American Indians. Its influence began to be felt upon this planet as early as 1962 as we entered the fringes of the Photon Belt. This time period also heralded a period of great \"UFO\" activity. Entry into the Photon Belt has always been associated with ease of space travel - historically, space travellers arrived during the era of passage through the Photon Belt, or Earth inhabitants moved on. \n\nBy the early '90s the effects began to be much more noticeable, and polaroid photographs often produced unexpected 'sparkles' of light - the result of photons or gamma rays being picked up as they infiltrated the earth's atmosphere. \n\nThe Photon Belt was known prior to this, of course, but the information was not released for public consumption. There are many references to it in ancient texts, including the Bible. Very little real knowledge is permitted to filter down to the masses. Check for instance The Book of Revelation ..... \"There will be no sun, moon or stars.\" \n\nThe \"Ozone Hole\" problem and alleged effect of ultraviolet rays is in fact a cover-up of the dangers which entry into this Photon Belt presents - these photons are invisible penetrating rays of light which can be extremely damaging, just like X-rays. \n\nEarth will be a place created for those who make the transition, and this is most likely to happen during the null-zone, when everyone is responding to the correct vibration frequency so that it will be easier for the armada of more evolved beings to lift us from this planet to the more beautifully created place where we will have more balance and harmony to continue - ie, in the fourth dimension. Some of us, on a higher level of understanding, will go to a higher dimension than the fourth. Those who do not make the transition will experience death of the physical body; those who do will have a much lighter (less dense) physical body. \n\nBecause of the reduced solar radiation the temperature can be expected to become cooler and ice-caps will extend to a lattitude of about 40 degrees in both hemispheres - this is why recorded 'Ice'Ages' seem to last 2,000 years. It is interesting to note that the world communication centres and fixed satellites, U.S. military bases and experimental sightings are within the 'safe' zone. Note however that, as the earth is supposed to 'slurp to one side' the current position of lands should be quite different at that time, so it cannot be said that these places WILL be in a 'safe' zone. Read the works of Edgar Cayce and others regarding future climates in North America and elsewhere. The poles will be quite far from their present positions. \n\nTiming \n\nAs this Belt is continually contracting and expanding, it is rather difficult to be specific about the exact timing of the event. There were reports in 1992 that this could take place in July of that year, but the information stemmed from government sources, who were deliberately confusing the issue. A satellite was to be released at that time to set alight the Van Allen Belts, which encircle our planet, where nuclear radiation from Earth had accumulated, causing a similar effect [see Event No 2]. \n\nThe most likely date for this event is towards the close of the millenium. As it appears to be connected to the transition from the third to fourth dimension, the period 1999 to 2001 is a probable point in time - by that time the Earth's population may be only a fraction of what it is today, due to depopulation, therefore many of the problems foreseen and outlined here in the Guidelines for action will not be applicable as our present economic, political and spiritual state will have been drastically altered by then. [May 2001: there have been changes to the planned timing: currently it is estimated by scientists as August 2003: the Schumann Resonance, the earth's heartbeat, used to be 8.8 - it is now 12.1 - and when it reaches 13 .... the Null or Zero Point is reached.] \n\nFollowing this event will be 40 years without rain. Nostradamus said of the year 1999: \"and it will rain no more, but in 40 years, it will be normal.\" Now we have a more definite sense of timing. \n\nAccording to Eric von Daniken in his book Chariots of the Gods, there is a tribe in South America which was given an object by the 'Sky People' thousands of years ago. They were to keep this object clean, listen to it and ..... when it hums like a thousand swarms of bees we will be returning, they said. This cosmic alarm clock started humming about 1978. \n\nEffect of Entry \n\nThere are TWO possible scenarios. \n\nShould Earth reach this PHOTON Belt before our Sun does, the sky will appear to be on fire and there would be three days and three nights of blinding light. Welders' goggles would be needed to protect eyes from this light, as it would burn out the retinal nerves, and this would continue for 110 - 120 hours. This is a cold light, therefore there would be no heat. But there could be radiation, so one should remain indoors. \n\nIf the Sun reaches the Belt first there will be a similar period of immediate and total darkness, without the sun rising. All molecules will become excited and atomic structures will change at this point in time and all life-forms will have a certain luminescence about them, creating their own light system. \n\nSigns of the approach of the Photon Belt are said to be strange lighting effects or colors in the sky, a perception of less light - even in midsummer, and a gradual darkening of the planet itself, with final entry into total darkness taking 15 - 20 minutes. \n\nSome plane crashes and 'balls of lightning' can be attributed to or result from these particles of blinding light. Likewise, many instances of cities going off the grid, electricity shutdown, radar system malfunctions (at airports, for instance) stem from entry into the fringes of the Photon Belt. [Often they are man-made ] \n\nThe Earth's grid system will be nullified (this is a natural energy pattern which criss-crosses the globe - and is used by both military and extra-terrestrial craft). There will also be tremendous physical jolting, which will cause earthquakes and other geophysical events, consequently destroying communications, including transportation, which will in turn create food and other shortages. \n\nLiving creatures will feel a jolt of energy upon entry into the belt, and many physical bodies will not stand up to this electrical charge. It will be akin to putting one's finger in a live light socket. There are three types of bodies on this planet - corporeal, atmospherian and etherian: this will be our change from corporeal to atmospherian, for those who are ready and can take it. It will happen as stated in the Bible - 'Ye shall be changed to immortality without the separation of death in the twinkling of an eye.\" Animal life will react by early hibernation. \n\nIt is interesting to note the biblical reference to THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS OF DARKNESS. We can find no reference in any ancient or modern text to the people of Earth being permanently blinded, and for this reason we would infer that preparation should be for total darkness rather than blinding light. But it might be wise to have these welders' goggles available as a precautionary measure, as there are other dangers. [see Event No.2] \n\nPhoton energy is the energy of the future. It was being used in the early '90s for high-speed transportation in the form of the AURORA aircraft, which flies at close to the speed of light, and is completely silent in flight. This was covered in the May 1993 issue of Popular Science as well as elsewhere, but whether it was American or Russian in origin was still a question. \n\nEvent No.2 - Ignition of the Van Allen Belt \n\nScientists had warned that, if nuclear testing did not end by the early '80s, radiation would commence to fall back down on earth by the year 1993. Someone had the 'bright' idea of resolving the matter by burning up this radiation by using linear beam weapons. Fortunately the satellite despatched to do this in July 1992 failed just thirty minutes before ignition time. [Intervention by Higher Powers..... ] \n\nIf this experiment had succeeded, the light would have been so intense that no-one would have been able to go out of doors for three days unless they wore welders' goggles, and there would be massive blindness everywhere on the planet. Many people did in fact purchase welders' goggles at that time (and they may still be necessary, as further similar attempts are made). \n\nIn May 1992 it was reported that an army of satellites had been launched in order to drain-off photons from the Photon belt, and thereby delay entry, but again this appears to have been a cover-up of the activities referred to above. \n\n\n\nUPDATE: February 2003\n\"There are many darkside rumors concerning the fate of the Columbia Space Shuttle on February 1st. The Columbia mission was one of very evil intent. The Shuttle was carrying a payload of a very powerful nuclear bomb intended to be detonated to start Nuclear World War III. Using scalar technology the Forces of Light imploded the nuclear bomb, disintegrated the shuttle craft, and neutralized the radio-active fall-out. Had the bomb exploded as intended, the explosion would have ignited the Van Allen belt, a protective layer of intense radiation particles that surrounds our earth. The light from such an ignition would have caused immediate blindness to all people whose eyes were unprotected. The result of this explosion would have burned the entire surface of our planet and left it looking like planet Mars. Our evil government and other world controllers planned to be in their underground cities when this occurred. \" \n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGuidelines for action\nwhen EARTH meets the PHOTON BELT\nor\nthe VAN ALLEN BELT is ignited\n[Hopefully you will have to hang on to these instructions for quite some time yet!]\nTo counter the effect of this brilliant light (either from entry into the Photon Belt or ignition of the Van Allen Belt) one should obtain welders' goggles fitted with a #15 lens - this may be difficult to obtain, therefore we recommend rectangular flip-front goggles with the standard #5 lens plus an extra #10 lens which can be added on top of the existing lens to give adequate protection. This then gives a clear view with the front flipped up; and affords protection when lowered. \n\nPrior to anticipated date, ventilate well all rooms in the residence or office as OXYGEN is of prime importance. Remove possible pollutants and do not plan to carry out painting or redecoration work around this time. Keep welders' goggles handy, at home or in the office, as well as a headache remedy. \n\nShould an increase in the intensity of daylight be noticed, immediately darken all windows in the house after first putting on welders' goggles with the dark lens flipped upwards, so that one can still see clearly indoors. Retreat to the centre of the building, or below ground-level. At this point everyone should be confined to the building. \n\nWith the total failure of electricity, public services will fail - communications, telephone, water and power are dependent upon electricity - as are gas pumps, public lighting, radio and TV. One must be entirely independent - and isolated. The confusion and lack of services will continue well beyond the 120 hour period: prepare for at least ONE WEEK of emergency operations. Illumination will be limited to propane lamps or candlelight (see Note 8 below). \n\nCancel all travel plans for that time period - air, sea and land transportation systtems ALL depend upon electricity. Automobiles are dependent too upon an electrical battery (even when the fuel tank is FULL!) and will cease to function, creating chaos on the streets. The only means of transportation will be a bicycle - but even it will have no possible means of illumination (remember, TOTAL darkness prevails) other than propane or candlelight. \n\n[A similar effect was experienced in the State of Utah on July 18th, 1994, when all traffic stopped on Interstate 15 near Farmington, a northern suburb of Salt Lake City, except for an older vehicle - without electronic ignition (prior to 1983) - which weaved its way past all other stalled vehicles: but if its battery had failed, it would have suffered the same fate. It was reported that at that particular moment four helicopters were seen hovering over the freeway: when vehicles restarted about an hour later, these same helicopters were seen flying off in formation, so this was obviously a high level experiment. This is the same effect as a UFO has when it approaches a vehicle.] \n\n[We should also mention another event which would permanently disable all electronic systems: EMP or electromagnetic pulse - the result of the above-ground burst of a neutron bomb.] \n\nKEEP OFF THE STREETS!! Plan a program at home which will keep everyone as occupied as possible for at least three days. There could be widespread activity during this period which would affect the public in general. Darkness can also be a time for dark deeds. This could vary from political activity to criminal acts, so security should be a high priority. In the case of blinding light, many will still move around - blinded by rage - and will be dangerous. \n\nEnsure premises are secure at all times. Security systems will not be working. This is prime time for vandalism and crime in general, so ensure that one has a means of identifying without any shadow of a doubt who might be at the door - or play it safe and allow NO ENTRY whatsoever. Let close friends know of the arrangement. \n\nThe complete lack of heat should not be an insurmountable problem unless the event occurs in winter, and should be overcome with extra clothing. Bodies also give off some heat. It has not been accurately projected what the effect would be of three days without normal daytime (solar) heating, but assume that there will be a considerable drop in temperature. Ensure nevertheless that there is ALWAYS an adequate supply of fresh air, despite any cold. Woodstoves would be most advantageous for both heating and cooking, if a supply of fuel is readily available. Be sure to check or extinguish open fires before going to sleep. \n\nLight and heat can be supplied by candles but it is more important to note that most candles give off undesirable fumes. Ensure that what you use are 100% beeswax candles. Propane or butane can be used in a well-ventilated area for lighting, cooking and heating purposes, but one might be well-advised to do without cooked foods over this period. \n\nNOTE: Pure beeswax candles are non-allergenic, burn 20 to 30 times longer than traditional",
