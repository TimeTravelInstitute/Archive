								<div class="bbWrapper">The ancient traditions and scriptures from different continents talk about a <br />
<br />
race of serpent beings endowed with superhuman powers. The scriptural and <br />
<br />
folkloric resources are used to present more complete picture of them and <br />
<br />
their ancient and recent interaction with humans.<br />
<br />
There has been an unprecedented increase of interest in UFO and <br />
<br />
paranormal issues in official media. Some consider this to be a result of <br />
<br />
leaks from the intelligence community. The fact is that there has been wide <br />
<br />
and profound change of public attitude in this regard. An example of this is <br />
<br />
how the alien image underwent a significant change during the years, from the <br />
<br />
ridiculed &quot;little green men&quot; of the cartoons in the early fifties to the <br />
<br />
classical &quot;grays&quot; as benevolent &quot;space brothers&quot; in seventies. Later, however, <br />
<br />
they have become more and more malicious and associated with the phenomena of <br />
<br />
cattle mutilation and human abduction. This picture is probably the one most <br />
<br />
often associated with the word &quot;aliens&quot; nowadays.<br />
<br />
But in the past few years there appeared a new type of aliens: the <br />
<br />
&quot;reptilians&quot; (also called &quot;reptoids,&quot; &quot;sauroids&quot; etc.). The media and market <br />
<br />
became flooded by reptile/dragon/dinosaur characters. The entertainment <br />
<br />
industry made them almost omnipresent, from children toys and cartoons to most <br />
<br />
successful movies. This phenomena is analyzed to some extent in the file The <br />
<br />
Cult of the Serpent and others. Several &quot;alien files&quot; available on the internet present a compilation of manifold information about aliens <br />
<br />
in earth's history, presence and possible future as well as many of the <br />
<br />
related incidents regarding space and underground explorations. They also <br />
<br />
include quotations from various scriptures including the Bible and the Vedas. <br />
<br />
The term &quot;Veda,&quot; literally &quot;knowledge,&quot; the indologists usually apply <br />
<br />
to the four Vedas: Rg, Sama, Yajur and Atharva. However, in broader sense, it <br />
<br />
is also used for the related literature as the Puranas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, <br />
<br />
Itihasas etc. The fact that in these files the reptilians are associated with the Nagas of <br />
<br />
the ancient Vedic tradition is one of the reasons I have decided to write this <br />
<br />
article. <br />
<br />
Saurian Connection: Historical Background of the Serpent<br />
<br />
The snake (serpent spirit) has been a symbol of wisdom, eternity, healing, <br />
<br />
mystery, magical power, and holiness throughout most of the ancient <br />
<br />
non-western world. Its symbol is used today in medicine, and other healing <br />
<br />
professions, and its live descendants are hailed as sacred and used in <br />
<br />
everything from cancer drugs to sex potions. Serpent was worshiped in ancient <br />
<br />
Babylon, Mexico, Egypt, as well as many other places all over the world.<br />
<br />
The following passage is written by Soror Ourania (from &quot;Thelemix and Therion <br />
<br />
Rising&quot;) from the Gnostic point of view.<br />
<br />
&quot;The word Naga is rooted in Sanskrit and means &quot;serpent.&quot; &lt;Further meanings <br />
<br />
from the Sanskrit-English Dictionary by Monier Monier-Williams: m. &quot;not <br />
<br />
moving,&quot; a mountain (in Atharva Veda); the number 7 (because of the 7 <br />
<br />
principal mountains; any tree or plant (in Mahabharata); the sun.&gt; In the East <br />
<br />
Indian pantheon it is connected with the Serpent Spirit and the Dragon Spirit. <br />
<br />
It has an equivalence to the Burmese Nats, or god-serpents. In the Esoteric <br />
<br />
Tradition it is synonymous for Adepts, or Initiates. In India and Egypt, and <br />
<br />
even in Central and South America, the Naga stands for one who is wise.<br />
<br />
&quot;The &lt;buddhist philosopher&gt; Nagarjuna of India, for example, is shown with an <br />
<br />
aura, or halo, of seven serpents which is an indication of a very high degree <br />
<br />
of Initiation. The symbolism of the seven serpents, usually cobras, are also <br />
<br />
on Masonic aprons or certain systems in the Buddhist ruins of Cambodia <br />
<br />
(Ankhor) and Ceylon. The great temple-builders of the famous Ankhor Wat were <br />
<br />
considered to be the semi-divine Khmers. The avenue leading to the Temple is <br />
<br />
lined with the seven-headed Naga. And even in Mexico, we find the &quot;Naga&quot; which <br />
<br />
becomes &quot;Nagal.&quot; In China, the Naga is given the form of the Dragon and has a <br />
<br />
direct association with the Emperor and is known as the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;... <br />
<br />
while in Egypt the same association is termed &quot;King-Initiate.&quot; The Chinese are <br />
<br />
even said to have originated with the Serpent demi-gods and even to speak <br />
<br />
their language, Naga-Krita. For a place that has no serpents, Tibet, they are <br />
<br />
still known in a symbolic sense and are called &quot;Lu!&quot; (Naga). Nagarjuna called <br />
<br />
in Tibetan, &lt;becomes&gt; Lu-trub.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the Western traditions we find the same ubiquity for the Naga, or Serpent. <br />
<br />
One simple example is the Ancient Greek Goddess, Athena. She is known as a <br />
<br />
warrior Goddess as well as the Goddess of Wisdom; her symbol being the Serpent <br />
<br />
as displayed on her personal shield. Of course, in Genesis the Serpent is a <br />
<br />
Naga who instructs the new infant (humanity) in what is called the Knowledge <br />
<br />
of Good and Evil. The Christian church has, unfortunately transformed the <br />
<br />
Initiate-Teacher into a tempting and negative demon-character. An apocryphal <br />
<br />
tradition says that Apollonius of Tyana, while on a visit to India, was taught <br />
<br />
by the &quot;Nagas&quot; of Kashmir. (See The Life of Apollonius, by Philostratos) It is <br />
<br />
felt by many scholars of the Western Tradition that the life of Apollonius was <br />
<br />
taken from the New Testament, or that the narratives of the New Testament have <br />
<br />
been taken from the life of Apollonius. This is felt because of the undisputed <br />
<br />
and clear similarities of construction of that particular narrative.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naga is one of a handful of rare words surviving the loss of the first <br />
<br />
universal language. In Buddhism, Wisdom has always been tied, symbolically, to <br />
<br />
the figure of the Serpent. In the Western Tradition it can be found as used by <br />
<br />
the Christ in the Gospel of Saint Matthew (10:16), &quot;Be ye therefore wise as <br />
<br />
serpents, and harmless as doves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In all mythological language the snake is also an emblem of immortality. Its <br />
<br />
endless representation with its tail in its mouth (Ouroboros), and the <br />
<br />
constant renewal of its skin and vigor, enliven the symbols of continued youth <br />
<br />
and eternity.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Serpent's reputation for positive medicinal and/or life-preserving <br />
<br />
qualities have also contributed to the honors of the Serpent as STILL seen by <br />
<br />
the employment of the caduceus &lt;staff around which two snakes are wrapped&gt;. To <br />
<br />
this very day, the Hindus are taught that at the end of every Universal <br />
<br />
Manifestation (Kalpa) all things are re-absorbed into Deity during the <br />
<br />
interval between &quot;creations.&quot; He reposes upon the Serpent Shesha (Duration) <br />
<br />
who is called Ananta, or Endless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indoeuropean (Slavic) folklore<br />
<br />
The Slavic folklore often mentions snakes as the guards of treasures hidden <br />
<br />
underground or in caves closely following the Vedic tradition. Some of the <br />
<br />
snakes are said to possess a crown which is an interesting detail as we will <br />
<br />
see later.<br />
<br />
Although one may be tempted to discount the folklore as unreliable source <br />
<br />
there is certain evidence which seems to support it.<br />
<br />
Czech herpetologist Jiri Hales writes in his book &quot;Moji pratele hadi (&quot;My <br />
<br />
friends, the snakes&quot;) about his travels around eastern Slovakia in '70 in <br />
<br />
search of unusually great snakes and mentions several interesting accounts he <br />
<br />
heard from the local people. One even involves a military unit which was <br />
<br />
called to destroy an alleged 15 ft long snake. (Snakes of such length are <br />
<br />
unknown in this part of the world.) Another account pertains to a ranger who <br />
<br />
noticed a number of snakes in the forest crawling in one direction and out of <br />
<br />
curiosity followed them. Thus he has come upon a great &quot;snake king&quot; with a <br />
<br />
crown on his head surrounded by many snakes. Scared, he quickly left that <br />
<br />
place. Other accounts involve small children who claimed to play with great <br />
<br />
snakes and even communicate with them. Hales concludes that these accounts are <br />
<br />
credible as they include many details which a layman could not possibly make <br />
<br />
up without personal experience.<br />
<br />
North America: Hopi tribal tradition<br />
<br />
The Hopi legend is that there were two races, the children of the feather who <br />
<br />
came from the skies, and the children of the reptile who came from under the <br />
<br />
earth. The children of the reptile chased the Hopi Indians out of the earth. <br />
<br />
These evil under-grounders were also called Two Hearts.<br />
<br />
The Hopi Indian Legend of Creation tells of three different beginnings. One <br />
<br />
story says that Hopi have arisen from an underground paradise through an <br />
<br />
opening called Sipapu. The underground paradise was wondrous with beautiful <br />
<br />
clear skies and plentiful food sources &lt;cf bila-svarga&gt;. It was because of the <br />
<br />
existence of those called Two Hearts, the bad ones, that refuge was sought in <br />
<br />
the upper world by the Hopi, the peaceful ones. The underworld was not <br />
<br />
destroyed but was only sealed up to prevent the Two Hearts from rising upon to <br />
<br />
the surface world.<br />
<br />
The second story tells of the descent of the Hopi from the Blue Star of a <br />
<br />
constellation called the Seven Sisters. One version tells of their travel to <br />
<br />
earth on the back of Enki, the eagle. Grandfather, the Great Spirit, allowed <br />
<br />
the first man to select his home from the many stars of the universe. Enki <br />
<br />
told first man of his home earth, and brought him to visit. First man's <br />
<br />
exploration of the earth convinced him that this was where he wanted his <br />
<br />
children to be born and to grow. First Man returned to the heavens to tell <br />
<br />
Grandfather of his decision. Grandfather was pleased and granted to first man <br />
<br />
the right to call earth his home. First man soon returned to the green place <br />
<br />
or Sakwap with his family shortly afterwards. (Many of the hero stories <br />
<br />
throughout time and through many different cultures refer to a valiant group <br />
<br />
of seven.)<br />
<br />
These two legends remind of the story of Kashyapa Muni and his two wives, <br />
<br />
Kadru, the mother of serpents, and Vinata, the mother of Garuda, the divine <br />
<br />
eagle, mentioned later.<br />
<br />
Western Africa<br />
<br />
The Legend of Da<br />
<br />
The world was created by Nana-Buluku, the one god, who is neither male nor <br />
<br />
female. In time, Nana-Buluku gave birth to twins, Mawu and Lisa, and it is <br />
<br />
they who shaped the world and control it still, with their fourteen children, <br />
<br />
the Vodou, or lesser gods.<br />
<br />
In the beginning, before Mawu had any children, the Rainbow Serpent, Da, <br />
<br />
already existed - created to serve Nana-Buluku. The creator was carried <br />
<br />
everywhere in Da's mouth. Rivers, mountains, and valleys twine and curve <br />
<br />
because that is how the Rainbow Serpent Da moves. Wherever they stopped for <br />
<br />
the night, mountains arose, formed from the serpent's dung. That is why if you <br />
<br />
dig down deep into a mountain, you find riches.<br />
<br />
Now, when Nana-Buluku had finished creating, it was obvious that the earth <br />
<br />
just couldn't carry everything - all the mountains, trees, peoples, and <br />
<br />
animals. So, to keep the earth from capsizing, the creator asked Da to coil <br />
<br />
beneath it to cushion it - like the pads the African women and girls wear on <br />
<br />
their heads when they are carrying a heavy load.<br />
<br />
Because Da cannot stand heat, the creator made the ocean for the serpent to <br />
<br />
live in. And there Da has remained since the beginning of time, with his tail <br />
<br />
in his mouth. Even though the water keeps Da cool, he sometimes shifts around <br />
<br />
trying to get comfortable, and that's what causes earthquakes.<br />
<br />
Nana-Buluku tasked the red monkeys who live beneath the sea to keep Da fed, <br />
<br />
and they spend their time forging the iron bars that are the serpent's food. <br />
<br />
But sooner or later the monkey's supply of iron is bound to run out, and then <br />
<br />
Da will have nothing to eat. Famished with hunger, he will start to chew on <br />
<br />
his own tail, and then his writhings and convulsions will be so terrible that <br />
<br />
the whole earth will tilt, overburdened as it is with people and things, and <br />
<br />
slip into the sea.<br />
<br />
This legend mentions the serpent serving the creator god. This serpent <br />
<br />
resembles Ananta Shesha, who serves Vishnu as a bed and supports the universal <br />
<br />
structure. They are both situated at the bottom of the universe on the great <br />
<br />
ocean called Garbhodaka.<br />
<br />
Scandinavia<br />
<br />
The Norse Ragnarok involves the destruction of the earth and the abodes of the <br />
<br />
Norse demigods (called Asgard). It is said that during Ragnarok the world is <br />
<br />
destroyed with flames by a being called Surt, who lives beneath the lower <br />
<br />
world (appropriately called Hel) and was involved in the world's creation. By <br />
<br />
comparison, the Bhagavata Purana (3.11.30) states that at the end of Brahma's <br />
<br />
day, &quot;the devastation takes place due to the fire emanating from the mouth of <br />
<br />
Sankarshana.&quot; Sankarshana (Ananta Shesha) is a plenary expansion of Krishna <br />
<br />
who is &quot;seated at the bottom of the universe&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 3.8.3), <br />
<br />
beneath the lower planetary systems.<br />
<br />
In the Norse lore there can be found more connections to the Vedic tradition <br />
<br />
but they go beyond the present topic.<br />
<br />
Tibet<br />
<br />
Tibetan Buddhist perspective of the Nagas comes from Cho-Yang's &quot;Year of Tibet <br />
<br />
Edition&quot;:<br />
<br />
&quot;Among all the creatures of the six realms, humans are the most fortunate, and <br />
<br />
have the best opportunity for attaining the ultimate achievement. Gods and <br />
<br />
demi-gods dwell in immeasurable happiness, exhausting the fruits of their <br />
<br />
positive karma, and are too distracted with worldly pleasure to seek <br />
<br />
liberation from cyclic existence. Hungry ghosts and hell beings are too <br />
<br />
disturbed with suffering and animals are too dumb. Humans, who enjoy both <br />
<br />
pleasure and pain are the only ones who can seek liberation. (...)<br />
<br />
&quot;Unseen forces are believed to be as numerous as those we can see: in every <br />
<br />
pond, forest, tree, house, dwell creatures big and small, important and humble <br />
<br />
which occasionally appear to humans in various forms, as well as in visions <br />
<br />
and in dreams.<br />
<br />
&quot;All these creatures are believed to be ruled by the protectors of the ten <br />
<br />
directions. These deities include gods from the Hindu pantheon such as Brahma <br />
<br />
and Indra. They are gods, and though they are immensely powerful and believed <br />
<br />
to control all the forces of the universe they are not beyond the wheel of <br />
<br />
cyclic existence and thus cannot be an object of refuge for humans aspiring <br />
<br />
for liberation. They may or may not be sympathetic to the Buddhist doctrine, <br />
<br />
but their help and cooperation can be cultivated and is considered essential, <br />
<br />
since they control all other non-human creatures, gods, demi-gods and ghosts. <br />
<br />
Tantric rituals always include an offering to them at the beginning to assure <br />
<br />
their non-interference.<br />
<br />
&quot;The creatures dwelling in individual places are called Sa-dag or land owners, <br />
<br />
or guardian deities. They belong to the realm of demi-gods or ghosts - not all <br />
<br />
ghosts are miserable creatures, some are wealthy and powerful demons. They may <br />
<br />
appear to people as ghosts, demons, or in dreams in an infinite variety of <br />
<br />
forms, including the human one and may either help or harm depending on their <br />
<br />
disposition. Many of the creatures in lakes, ponds and rivers are nagas, or <br />
<br />
serpent beings who belong to the animal realm. They sometimes appear in the <br />
<br />
form of snakes, or as half snakes and half humans with elaborate jeweled <br />
<br />
crowns. They are believed to be infinitely wealthy and to owe their present <br />
<br />
form to a previous life of unethical generosity. &lt;Comment: This is called <br />
<br />
bhogonmukhi-sukrti, or pious activities that bestow material opulence. They <br />
<br />
are of godless nature but involve kindness to other beings, with a view toward <br />
<br />
material happiness.&gt;<br />
<br />
&quot;Human activity is bound to encroach on the well-being of living creatures <br />
<br />
including those of other realms. Coming to a plot of land and inadvertently <br />
<br />
building a house, cutting trees or mining and digging natural resources will <br />
<br />
upset nagas and sa-dags just as it does animals and insects in such a <br />
<br />
situation. It is said that sa-dags and nagas equate the unauthorized use of <br />
<br />
land and natural resources they occupy to pilfering their personal <br />
<br />
possessions. The weaker ones among them will undergo great hardship or die <br />
<br />
off, while the more powerful will react with anger and strike back at the <br />
<br />
offenders, inflicting disease, death, and sudden catastrophe. They will not <br />
<br />
necessarily strike at the humans having committed the harm, as most cannot <br />
<br />
identify the actual offenders, but at any human they see, and innocent people <br />
<br />
may fall ill or die for no apparent reason, or the whole area be affected with <br />
<br />
epidemics or cases of leprosy.<br />
<br />
&quot;The following story was related by a Dema Locho Rinpochey, from Drepung, and <br />
<br />
occurred in the 1950s in Tibet. One day, one of the monks who was responsible <br />
<br />
for having the trees in the debating square watered, developed a large sore on <br />
<br />
his thigh. Suspecting it was caused by harm from nagas, he asked Rinpochey to <br />
<br />
consult an oracle in a nearby village - a nun who was possessed by nagas - to <br />
<br />
find out the cause of his illness. The naga, speaking through the oracle <br />
<br />
admitted having caused the harm: 'Yes, it was I who struck at that monk.' When <br />
<br />
Rinpochey asked the reason, it replied: 'I was angry at humans for other <br />
<br />
reasons and I saw this monk's luck was down and that he was vulnerable, so I <br />
<br />
caused him to develop this sore'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans are most vulnerable to nagas and sa-dags when their luck is low, as it <br />
<br />
is said that any weakness is immediately apparent to these other-worldly <br />
<br />
creatures. In order to avert unlucky circumstances which may bring one harm, <br />
<br />
people hang up strings of different prayer flags bearing the image of a horse. <br />
<br />
The 'wind-horse' or Lung-ta is the symbol of one's luck. The Tibetan <br />
<br />
expression 'His wind-horse is running' or 'is broken' refers to this luck, and <br />
<br />
the prayer flags fluttering in the wind, a tradition of Bon origin, is <br />
<br />
believed to give the upper hand to one's wind-horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since humans cannot survive without some form of land exploitation and <br />
<br />
building, Tibetans take certain measures to prevent unnecessary mishaps. While <br />
<br />
the hanging of prayer flags is like a general preventive measure, that of <br />
<br />
avoiding harm which has no direct cause, more particular measures are sought <br />
<br />
when any kind of digging is involved. Whenever choosing a site for building, <br />
<br />
whether for a mandala, temple or house, a lama is consulted as to the method <br />
<br />
by which the nagas and sa-dag on the site might be appeased and treated. The <br />
<br />
lama will know something about them either through dreams, divination or <br />
<br />
clairvoyance. According to Buddhist tantric practice, there are other ways of <br />
<br />
performing rituals. These are: peaceful, increasing, forceful and wrathful. <br />
<br />
The methods that apply to pacifying creatures of other realms are peaceful and <br />
<br />
wrathful, and the rituals used are extremely varied, in type as well as in <br />
<br />
tradition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally, in either case, a ritual based on sutra called Tashi Sojong is <br />
<br />
performed, to bring good luck and please the dwellers. If performing tantric <br />
<br />
rituals, the lama will offer tormas to the sa-dag or nagas abiding on the <br />
<br />
land. Tormas are conical-shaped offering cakes which have been blessed in <br />
<br />
three ways by a highly realized being by mantras, where they are purified from <br />
<br />
any defilements of ordinariness, by meditational stabilization, by which they <br />
<br />
are made infinite and by gestures, or mudras, which ensure that the recipient <br />
<br />
is satisfied. The idea of this ritual is to offer gifts to the sa-dag and <br />
<br />
nagas in exchange for use of their land. It is a deal, a give and take <br />
<br />
situation like selling a house, and if the 'sellers' are satisfied, things <br />
<br />
will proceed smoothly. There are some situations, however, where the land may <br />
<br />
be owned by particularly powerful sa-dags, who will not want to give in to <br />
<br />
humans and will do their utmost to create obstacles and harm. Such places are <br />
<br />
known as 'rough'. The spirits and demons inhabiting them will be unyielding in <br />
<br />
their views and generally delight in causing harm to human trespassers causing <br />
<br />
illness and bad dreams. If the lama examining the land sees such a situation, <br />
<br />
he will either declare the site unfit for building, or deal with the situation <br />
<br />
using the wrathful method.<br />
<br />
&quot;Through the possibilities are vast, the most commonly used wrathful method <br />
<br />
for clearing a site from negative forces, is the 'throwing of ritual cakes' <br />
<br />
which is like using a bomb to send harmful creatures to another existence. The <br />
<br />
motivation of the lama is one of compassion, and knowing that the purpose of <br />
<br />
the project is beneficial one and that the being causing the harm is <br />
<br />
accumulating negative karma, he will actually help it by transferring its <br />
<br />
consciousness to another realm where it will be of less harm to other beings. <br />
<br />
Only a person with a higher level of realization is qualified to perform such <br />
<br />
a ritual.<br />
<br />
&quot;When obstacles are removed, the Lu Thaye, a very powerful naga believed to be <br />
<br />
constantly moving under the ground is dealt with. Sudden digging would disturb <br />
<br />
him, but his movements in a particular spot can be plotted astrologically, and <br />
<br />
a spot on the plot can be found where no part of his body would be present at <br />
<br />
the time of the first, symbolic digging. This would be followed by offerings <br />
<br />
of ritual cakes to pacify him. This done, the building could proceed without <br />
<br />
further interference.<br />
<br />
&quot;In some cases, sa-dags and nagas not only take offense at encroachment on <br />
<br />
their land, but at harm inflicted on certain animals they feel are their own. <br />
<br />
The following is a story which took place about eighty years ago in a remote <br />
<br />
area of Kham. The head of a group of nomads, feeling he was above the law <br />
<br />
against hunting wild animals which prevailed in his land, one day decided to <br />
<br />
go shooting. He went off with his rifle and spotted a beautiful stag. He aimed <br />
<br />
at it, and saw something like a golden stirrup between its antlers. He put <br />
<br />
down his rifle and stared, but could see nothing. He aimed and put down his <br />
<br />
rifle two or three times, seeing the stirrup appear and disappear, hesitated, <br />
<br />
and finally shot. The stag was hit by the bullet but escaped, leaving a trail <br />
<br />
of blood. That night, the man returned home, unable to find the carcass of the <br />
<br />
animal he had hoped to kill and suddenly became very ill. As he lay dying, he <br />
<br />
related to his kin the incident with the stag, regretting he had shot it and <br />
<br />
mumbling he should have known better, seeing such an unusual object as a <br />
<br />
golden stirrup between its antlers. He died that very night and his family <br />
<br />
concluded he was the victim of a revengeful sa-dag to whom either the stag <br />
<br />
belonged to or of which he had taken the form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Incense and vase-offering rituals, which were routinely performed by the <br />
<br />
Tibetan government and also by private individuals and lamas were not only <br />
<br />
meant as a remedy in case of drought or other calamities, but also as a <br />
<br />
regular preventive measure to bring about positive conditions. Non-human <br />
<br />
creatures were known for their liking of fragrant smells, and the tradition of <br />
<br />
sang-so, which was originally practised by the Bon to appease and please local <br />
<br />
deities, was later practised by Buddhists for the same purpose. In the case of <br />
<br />
vase-offering rituals, vases were filled with different precious metals and <br />
<br />
cereals, blessed by mantras, meditative stabilization and gestures and placed <br />
<br />
in lakes or other places throughout the country where nagas were known to <br />
<br />
dwell, as a boon to them. These gifts could be likened to presents offered by <br />
<br />
the king of one country to that of another, aimed at pleasing the recipients <br />
<br />
who reciprocated with timely rain, pure water and a disease free environment. <br />
<br />
They had ways of showing their liking in particular ways. Dema Locho Rinpochey <br />
<br />
recalls a time when Drepung Loseling college decided to renovate a small <br />
<br />
retreat house on one of their estates, a few hours from Lhasa. The place had a <br />
<br />
spring and was known for its important naga and sa-dag population. The college <br />
<br />
called on Rinpochey to perform a ritual to keep the nagas out of the way <br />
<br />
during the time of the restoration work. This involved attracting them into a <br />
<br />
mirror which was transformed, by the lama's concentration, into a very <br />
<br />
pleasant abode in which they were asked to remain, as honoured guests, until <br />
<br />
their usual dwelling was once more fit to stay in. Rinpoche also offered a <br />
<br />
bathing ritual to the spring, purifying any defilements it would have <br />
<br />
undergone during the work. He said that the next morning, the caretaker <br />
<br />
pointed out that the water was much more abundant than usual, a sign that the <br />
<br />
nagas who dwelled in it were pleased.&quot;<br />
<br />
Middle East<br />
<br />
&quot;The possibility that an ancient reptilian-saurian race may exist below the <br />
<br />
surface of this planet is not an idea which is relatively new. This infernal <br />
<br />
yet physical race has been referred to in spiritual and historical records <br />
<br />
which date back to the beginning of time. Ancient Hebrew history, for <br />
<br />
instance, records that our human ancestors were not the only intelligent, <br />
<br />
free-will beings who inhabited the ancient world. Genesis chapter 3 refers to <br />
<br />
the &quot;Serpent,&quot; which according to many ancient Hebrew scholars was identified <br />
<br />
with a hominoid or bi-ped reptilian being. The ancient Hebrew word for <br />
<br />
&quot;Serpent&quot; is &quot;Nachash&quot; (which according to Strong's Comprehensive and other <br />
<br />
Biblical concordances contained in itself the meanings: Reptile, Enchantment, <br />
<br />
Hissing, Whisper, Diligently Observe, Learn by Experience, Incantation, Snake, <br />
<br />
etc. all of which may be descriptive of the serpent-sauroid race which we have <br />
<br />
been referring to). The original &quot;Nachash&quot; was not actually a &quot;snake&quot; as most <br />
<br />
people believe, but actually an extremely intelligent, cunning creature <br />
<br />
possessed with the ability to speak and reason. It also stood upright as we've <br />
<br />
said, as did many of it's descendants, the small &quot;saurian&quot; predators which <br />
<br />
ambled about on two legs.&quot; (from &quot;The Cult of the Serpent&quot; file, edited by <br />
<br />
Branton)<br />
<br />
In the book of Genesis Elohim punished the Serpent for deceiving Eve by <br />
<br />
ordering him to crawl on his stomach from that time on. They (Elohim) also <br />
<br />
created enmity between human and serpent race.<br />
<br />
The book of Revelation describes eschatological accounts when the enmity <br />
<br />
between human and serpent race escalates into an open conflict: &quot;...And there <br />
<br />
was war in heaven: Michael fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought <br />
<br />
and his angels... and the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called <br />
<br />
the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world...&quot; (Rev. 12<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite16" alt=":love:" title="Love    :love:" />)<br />
<br />
There are other interesting biblical references to serpents and dragons in <br />
<br />
Psalms 44:19, 74:13, 148<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite16" alt=":love:" title="Love    :love:" />, Issaiah 13:22, etc.<br />
<br />
India: Nagas of the Underworld<br />
<br />
The Nagas are a race of serpent beings. Most often they manifest themselves <br />
<br />
with half-man, half-serpent bodies, although sometimes they assume the shape <br />
<br />
of a dragon, or appear in the guise of a cobra. They can take many different <br />
<br />
forms including snakes, humans with snake tails and normal humans, often <br />
<br />
beautiful maidens. A precious gem is embedded in their heads endowing them <br />
<br />
with supernatural powers including invisibility. Some are demoniac, some <br />
<br />
neutral or sometimes helpful.<br />
<br />
Nagas are divided into four classes: heavenly, divine, earthly or hidden, <br />
<br />
depending upon their function in guarding the heavenly palace, bringing <br />
<br />
rainfall, draining rivers or guarding treasures.<br />
<br />
In Burma, the Nagas combine elements of the dragon, snake and crocodile. They <br />
<br />
have guarded and protected several royal Burmese personages. They also give <br />
<br />
rubies to those they favor.<br />
<br />
They inhabit lakes and rivers, but their real domain is a vast underground <br />
<br />
region called Bila-svarga, or subterranean heavens. There they guard great <br />
<br />
amounts of jewels and precious metals. Here they dwell with their seductive <br />
<br />
mates, the Naginis who sometimes seduce humans.<br />
<br />
One such account is to be found for example in the Mahabharata. Arjuna, the <br />
<br />
son of King Pandu, was &quot;abducted&quot; by Ulupi, the Naga princess who enamored <br />
<br />
him, into the parallel realm in the river Ganges near Hardwar. After spending <br />
<br />
a night with her and begetting a son called Iravan, he returned back. This <br />
<br />
incident is also mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana 9.22.32. R. Thompson in his <br />
<br />
book &quot;Alien Identities&quot; uses this account to give an example of parallel <br />
<br />
dimensions.<br />
<br />
The Mahabharata story follows:<br />
<br />
&quot;When his residence was thus crowded with divinity, the darling son of Pandu <br />
<br />
and Kunti then went down into the Ganges water, to be consecrated for holy <br />
<br />
rite. Taking his ritual bath and worshiping his forefathers, Arjuna, happy to <br />
<br />
take his part in the rite of fire, was rising out of the water, O king, when <br />
<br />
he was pulled back in by Ulupi, the virgin daughter of the serpent king, who <br />
<br />
could travel about at her will and was now within those waters. Holding onto <br />
<br />
him, she pulled him down into the land of the Nagas, into her father's house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arjuna then saw in the most honorable house of the Naga king, whose name was <br />
<br />
Kauravya, a carefully attended fire. Dhananjaya Arjuna, son of Kunti, took <br />
<br />
over the duty of the fire, and without hesitation he made the offering and <br />
<br />
satisfied the sacred flames. Having done the duty to the fire, the son of <br />
<br />
Kunti then said laughingly to the daughter of the Naga king, &quot;Why have you <br />
<br />
acted so boldly, O shy and beautiful woman? What is the name of this opulent <br />
<br />
land? Who are you and whose daughter are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ulupi said: &quot;There is a serpent named Kauravya, born in the family of <br />
<br />
Airavata. I am his daughter, O Partha, and my name is Ulupi, lady of the <br />
<br />
snakes. I saw you, Kaunteya, when you went down into the waters to take your <br />
<br />
ritual bath, and I was stunned by Cupid. O Kuru child, now that the god of <br />
<br />
love has stirred me up so, you must welcome me, for I have no one else, and I <br />
<br />
have given myself to you in a secluded place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arjuna said: &quot;Dharmaraja Yudhisthira has instructed me to practice celibacy <br />
<br />
for twelve months, and I agreed; thus I am not my own master. I would like to <br />
<br />
please you, but I have never spoken an untruth. How can I avoid a lie and also <br />
<br />
please you, snake woman? If it could be done without hurting my religious <br />
<br />
principles, then I would do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ulupi said: &quot;I understand, son of Pandu, how you are wandering the earth, and <br />
<br />
how your elder brother has instructed you to practice celibacy: &quot;There will be <br />
<br />
a mutual accord that if any one of us mistakenly intrudes upon the others <br />
<br />
during their time with Drupada's daughter, then he must remain in the forest <br />
<br />
for twelve months as a celibate brahmacari.&quot; That was the agreement you all <br />
<br />
made. But this exile you agreed upon is in regards to Draupadi. You all <br />
<br />
accepted the religious vow to be celibate in relation to her, and so your <br />
<br />
religious vow is not violated here with me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your eyes are very big and handsome, and it is your duty to rescue those who <br />
<br />
are in pain. Save me now, and there will be no breach of your religious <br />
<br />
principles. And even if there is some very subtle transgression of your <br />
<br />
religious principles, then let this be religious rule, Arjuna, that you gave <br />
<br />
me back my life. My lord, accept me as I have accepted you, for it will be an <br />
<br />
act approved by decent people; And if you will not accept me, then know that I <br />
<br />
am a dead woman. O strong-armed one, practice the greatest virtue, which is <br />
<br />
the act of giving life. I come to you now for shelter, for you are an ideal <br />
<br />
man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaunteya, you always take care of the poor and helpless people, and I have <br />
<br />
gone straight to you for shelter and am crying out in pain. I beg you, for my <br />
<br />
desire is so strong. Therefore you must please me by giving yourself; it is <br />
<br />
proper for you to make me a satisfied woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sri Vaisampayana said: &quot;Thus addressed by the virgin daughter of the serpent <br />
<br />
lord, the son of Kunti, basing his actions on the religious law, did for her <br />
<br />
all that she desired. The fiery hero Arjuna spent the night in the palace of <br />
<br />
the Naga king, and when the sun rose he too rose up from Kauravya's abode.&quot;<br />
<br />
Similar story is recorded in the Harivansha, which is the addendum to the <br />
<br />
Mahabharata. Yadu, the founder of the Yadava family, went for a trip to the <br />
<br />
sea, where he was carried off by Dhumavarna, king of the serpents, to the <br />
<br />
capital of the serpents. Dhumavarna married his five daughters to Yadu, and <br />
<br />
from them sprang seven distinct families of people.<br />
<br />
Kumudvati, the Naga princess, married Kusha, the son of Rama, as described in <br />
<br />
the scripture Raghuvansha.<br />
<br />
The following account touches upon the issue of underground hominoid-sauroid <br />
<br />
conflicts.<br />
<br />
The Vishnu Purana speaks about the Gandharvas, descendants of sage Kashyapa <br />
<br />
and his wife Muni. Therefore they are also called Mauneyas. (According to <br />
<br />
Hindu Dictionary by Manurishi Foundation, the Mauneyas are a class of <br />
<br />
Gandharvas, who dwell beneath the earth, and are sixty millions in number.) <br />
<br />
They were fighting with the Nagas in the subterranean regions, whose dominions <br />
<br />
they seized and whose treasures they plundered. The Naga chiefs appealed to <br />
<br />
Vishnu for relief, and He promised to appear in the person of Purukutsa, son <br />
<br />
of King Mandhata, to help them. Thereupon the Nagas sent their sister Narmada <br />
<br />
to this Purukutsa, and she conducted him to the regions below, where he <br />
<br />
destroyed the Gandharvas. (According to the Ramayana similar Gandharvas were <br />
<br />
defeated by Bharata, the brother of Rama, and Hanuman.) The ninth khanda of <br />
<br />
the Bhagavata Purana also briefly mentions this story.<br />
<br />
The Bhagavata Purana narration is based on the incident which happened to King <br />
<br />
Pariksit. He was cursed by a young brahmana to die within seven days as a <br />
<br />
result of a snakebite. The boy thought the king had offended his father, who <br />
<br />
did not welcome the king in his ashrama being absorbed in deep meditation. <br />
<br />
Thus the king left after putting a dead snake on sage's shoulder. The king <br />
<br />
decided to accept the curse as a will of providence and sat down at the bank <br />
<br />
of Ganges to prepare for his death. At that time the great young sage Shuka, <br />
<br />
the son of Vyasa, arrived there and the king asked him to explain the most <br />
<br />
important knowledge meant for a person about to die. Thus the sage started to <br />
<br />
narrate the great Purana. As a result the king attained self-realization.<br />
<br />
His son Janamejaya, however, became angry at the serpents and to revenge his <br />
<br />
father's death he started a great sacrifice meant to destroy all the serpents <br />
<br />
but later he stopped it to please the sage Astika, their relative. (Astika's <br />
<br />
father was the sage Jaratkaru who married Manasa, the sister of the Naga king <br />
<br />
Vasuki.) The whole story is narrated in the Mahabharata, Adi Parva.<br />
<br />
The origin of the Naga race is described in the Mahabharata, Adi Parva:<br />
<br />
&quot;Long ago, in the godly millennium, Prajapati Daksha had two brilliant and <br />
<br />
sinless daughters, amazing sisters who were gifted with great beauty. Named <br />
<br />
Kadru and Vinata, they both became wives of the primordial sage Kashyapa, a <br />
<br />
husband who was equal in glory to the Prajapati. Being pleased with his <br />
<br />
religious wive, Kashyapa, with much happiness, offered them both a boon. <br />
<br />
Hearing of Kashyapa's joyful intention to let them choose an extraordinary <br />
<br />
boon, the two excellent women felt an incomparable joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kadru chose to create one thousand serpent sons, all of equal strength, and <br />
<br />
Vinata hankered to have two sons who would exceed all of Kadru's sons in <br />
<br />
stamina, strength, valor, and spiritual influence. Her husband awarded her <br />
<br />
only one and a half of these desired sons, knowing that she could not have <br />
<br />
more. Vinata then said to Kashyapa, &quot;Let me have at least one superior son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vinata felt that her purpose was satisfied and that somehow both sons would <br />
<br />
be of superior strength. Kadru too felt her purpose fulfilled, since she would <br />
<br />
have one thousand sons of equal prowess. Both wives were delighted with their <br />
<br />
boons. Then Kashyapa, that mighty ascetic, urging them to carry their embryos <br />
<br />
with utmost care, retired to the forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;After a long time Kadru produced one thousand eggs, O leader of brahmanas, <br />
<br />
and Vinata produced two eggs. Their delighted assistants placed the two <br />
<br />
sisters' eggs in moist vessels, where they remained for five hundred years. <br />
<br />
When the years had passed, the sons of Kadru hatched from their eggs, but from <br />
<br />
Vinata's two eggs her two sons were not to be seen. That austere and godly <br />
<br />
woman, anxious to have children, was ashamed. Thus Vinata broke open one egg <br />
<br />
and saw therein her son. Authorities say that the upper half of the child's <br />
<br />
body was fully developed, but the lower half was not yet well formed.&quot;<br />
<br />
This son was Aruna, the charioteer of Surya, the sun god. His brother was the <br />
<br />
powerful Garuda, divine eagle, who became the carrier of Vishnu. Garuda is an <br />
<br />
avowed enemy of serpents who are his food. Krishna mentions him among the most <br />
<br />
prominent representatives of His power: &quot;Among the Daitya demons I am the <br />
<br />
devoted Prahlada, among subduers I am time, among beasts I am the lion, and <br />
<br />
among birds I am Garuda.&quot; (Bhagavad-gita 10.30)<br />
<br />
Nilamata Purana, the ancient history of Kashmir, is centered around the <br />
<br />
original inhabitants of Kashmir, the Nagas. In the verses 232-233 it mentions <br />
<br />
their capital: &quot;O Naga, the dwelling of the Nagas is the city named Bhogavati. <br />
<br />
Having become a Yogi that Naga-chief (Vasuki) dwells there as well as here. <br />
<br />
But with his primary body, Vasuki, protecting the Nagas, shall live in <br />
<br />
Bhogavati. O sinless one, you (also) dwell here constantly.&quot; Bhogavati is also <br />
<br />
mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana 1.11.11. Its another name is Putkari.<br />
<br />
Bhagavata Purana gives the following description of Bila-svarga, the <br />
<br />
subterranean regions compared for their opulence to heaven (5.24.7-15):<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear King, beneath this earth are seven other planets, known as Atala, <br />
<br />
Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala and Patala. I have already <br />
<br />
explained the situation of the planetary systems of earth. The width and <br />
<br />
length of the seven lower planetary systems are calculated to be exactly the <br />
<br />
same as those of earth.<br />
<br />
&quot;In these seven planetary systems, which are also known as the subterranean <br />
<br />
heavens &lt;bila-svarga&gt;, there are very beautiful houses, gardens and places of <br />
<br />
sense enjoyment, which are even more opulent than those in the higher planets <br />
<br />
because the demons have a very high standard of sensual pleasure, wealth and <br />
<br />
influence. Most of the residents of these planets, who are known as Daityas, <br />
<br />
Danavas and Nagas, live as householders. Their wives, children, friends and <br />
<br />
society are all fully engaged in illusory, material happiness. The sense <br />
<br />
enjoyment of the demigods is sometimes disturbed, but the residents of these <br />
<br />
planets enjoy life without disturbances. Thus they are understood to be very <br />
<br />
attached to illusory happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear King, in the imitation heavens known as bila-svarga there is a great <br />
<br />
demon named Maya Danava, who is an expert artist and architect. He has <br />
<br />
constructed many brilliantly decorated cities. There are many wonderful <br />
<br />
houses, walls, gates, assembly houses, temples, yards and temple compounds, as <br />
<br />
well as many hotels serving as residential quarters for foreigners. The houses <br />
<br />
for the leaders of these planets are constructed with the most valuable <br />
<br />
jewels, and they are always crowded with living entities known as Nagas and <br />
<br />
Asuras, as well as many pigeons, parrots and similar birds. All in all, these <br />
<br />
imitation heavenly cities are most beautifully situated and attractively <br />
<br />
decorated.<br />
<br />
&quot;The parks and gardens in the artificial heavens surpass in beauty those of <br />
<br />
the upper heavenly planets. The trees in those gardens, embraced by creepers, <br />
<br />
bend with a heavy burden of twigs with fruits and flowers, and therefore they <br />
<br />
appear extraordinarily beautiful. That beauty could attract anyone and make <br />
<br />
his mind fully blossom in the pleasure of sense gratification. There are many <br />
<br />
lakes and reservoirs with clear, transparent water, agitated by jumping fish <br />
<br />
and decorated with many flowers such as lilies, kuvalayas, kahlaras and blue <br />
<br />
and red lotuses. Pairs of cakravakas and many other water birds nest in the <br />
<br />
lakes and always enjoy in a happy mood, making sweet, pleasing vibrations that <br />
<br />
are very satisfying and conducive to enjoyment of the senses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since there is no sunshine in those subterranean planets, time is not divided <br />
<br />
into days and nights, and consequently fear produced by time does not exist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many great serpents reside there with gems on their hoods, and the effulgence <br />
<br />
of these gems dissipates the darkness in all directions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since the residents of these planets drink and bathe in juices and elixirs <br />
<br />
made from wonderful herbs, they are freed from all anxieties and physical <br />
<br />
diseases. They have no experience of grey hair, wrinkles or invalidity, their <br />
<br />
bodily lusters do not fade, their perspiration does not cause a bad smell, and <br />
<br />
they are not troubled by fatigue or by lack of energy or enthusiasm due to old <br />
<br />
age.<br />
<br />
&quot;They live very auspiciously and do not fear death from anything but death's <br />
<br />
established time, which is the effulgence of the Sudarshana chakra of the <br />
<br />
Supreme Personality of Godhead.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the Sudarshana disc enters those provinces, the pregnant wives of the <br />
<br />
demons all have miscarriages due to fear of its effulgence.&quot;<br />
<br />
5.24.29-31:<br />
<br />
&quot;The planetary system below Talatala is known as Mahatala. It is the abode of <br />
<br />
many-hooded snakes, descendants of Kadru, who are always very angry. The great <br />
<br />
snakes who are prominent are Kuhaka, Taksaka, Kaliya and Susena. The snakes in <br />
<br />
Mahatala are always disturbed by fear of Garuda, the carrier of Lord Vishnu, <br />
<br />
but although they are full of anxiety, some of them nevertheless sport with <br />
<br />
their wives, children, friends and relatives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beneath Mahatala is the planetary system known as Rasatala, which is the <br />
<br />
abode of the demoniac sons of Diti and Danu. They are called Panis, <br />
<br />
Nivata-kavacas, Kaleyas and Hiranya-puravasis &lt;those living in Hiranya-pura&gt;. <br />
<br />
They are all enemies of the demigods, and they reside in holes like snakes. <br />
<br />
From birth they are extremely powerful and cruel, and although they are proud <br />
<br />
of their strength, they are always defeated by the Sudarshana chakra of the <br />
<br />
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who rules all the planetary systems. When a <br />
<br />
female messenger from Indra named Sarama chants a particular curse, the <br />
<br />
serpentine demons of Mahatala become very afraid of Indra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beneath Rasatala is another planetary system, known as Patala or Nagaloka, <br />
<br />
where there are many demoniac serpents, the masters of Nagaloka, such as <br />
<br />
Shankha, Kulika, Mahashankha, Shveta, Dhananjaya, Dhrtarashtra, Shankhacuda, <br />
<br />
Kambala, Ashvatara and Devadatta. The chief among them is Vasuki. They are all <br />
<br />
extremely angry, and they have many, many hoods - some snakes five hoods, some <br />
<br />
seven, some ten, others a hundred and others a thousand. These hoods are <br />
<br />
bedecked with valuable gems, and the light emanating from the gems illuminates <br />
<br />
the entire planetary system of bila-svarga.&quot;<br />
<br />
Divine connection<br />
<br />
Serpents have their special place in most spiritual traditions (as already <br />
<br />
shown above) where they symbolize either good or evil. In the Vedic tradition <br />
<br />
they are inherently related to some of its most important personages.<br />
<br />
Shiva<br />
<br />
Shiva (&quot;auspicious One&quot;), is one of the members of the trimurti (Brahma, <br />
<br />
Vishnu and Shiva). He is in charge of the material mode of ignorance <br />
<br />
(tamo-guna) bringing destruction of the universe:<br />
<br />
&quot;Yamaraja said: My dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but <br />
<br />
factually I am not. Above me, and above all the other demigods, including <br />
<br />
Indra and Candra, is the one supreme master and controller. The partial <br />
<br />
manifestations of His personality are Brahma, Visnu and Siva, who are in <br />
<br />
charge of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this universe. He is <br />
<br />
like the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth. The <br />
<br />
entire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a rope in <br />
<br />
its nose.&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 6.3.12)<br />
<br />
His position is between the living beings (jiva-tattva) and the Supreme Lord, <br />
<br />
Vishnu (vishnu-tattva), in the category of his own, shiva-tattva.<br />
<br />
Shiva is usually depicted in painting and sculpture as white or ash-colored, <br />
<br />
with a blue neck (from holding in his throat the poison thrown up at the <br />
<br />
churning of the cosmic ocean, which threatened to destroy humankind), his hair <br />
<br />
arranged in a coil of matted locks (jatamakuta) and adorned with the crescent <br />
<br />
moon and the Ganges (he allowed her to trickle through his hair). He has three <br />
<br />
eyes, the third eye bestowing inward vision but capable of burning destruction <br />
<br />
when focused outward. He wears a garland of skulls and a serpent around his <br />
<br />
neck and carries in his two (sometimes four) hands a deerskin, a trident, a <br />
<br />
small hand drum, or a club with a skull at the end.<br />
<br />
His paraphernalia symbolizes: moon - time measurement in months, three eyes - <br />
<br />
tri-kala-jna (&quot;knower of three phases of time - past, present, and future&quot;), <br />
<br />
snake around the neck - time measurement in years, necklace of skulls with <br />
<br />
snakes - changing of ages and begetting and annihilating of mankind. His <br />
<br />
association with the serpents is obvious from his epithets: Nagabhushana, <br />
<br />
Vyalakalpa (&quot;having serpents as ornaments&quot;), Nagaharadhrik (&quot;wearing <br />
<br />
serpent-necklaces&quot;), Nagaraja, Nagendra, Nagesha (&quot;king of Nagas&quot;), Nakula <br />
<br />
(&quot;mongoose,&quot; one who is immune from the serpent venom), Vyalin (&quot;one who <br />
<br />
possesses snakes&quot;), etc. Shiva is the main object of worship at Benares under <br />
<br />
the name Vishveshvara (&quot;master of the universe&quot;).<br />
<br />
One of his features is time (Bhagavad-gita 11.32: &quot;Time I am,&quot; Bhagavata <br />
<br />
Purana 3.5.26-27, Brahma-samhita 5.10), the separating factor between the <br />
<br />
material and spiritual world (Bhagavata Purana 3.10.12) and a medium to <br />
<br />
perceive the Lord's influence (Bhagavata Purana 3.26.16).<br />
<br />
Shiva's female consort is known under various names as Uma, Sati, Parvati, <br />
<br />
Durga, Kali, and Shakti. The divine couple, together with their sons - the <br />
<br />
six-headed Skanda and the elephant-headed Ganesha - are inhabiting the Mount <br />
<br />
Kailasa in the Himalayas as well as the Mahesha-dhama on the border of the <br />
<br />
material world (Devi-dhama) and the spiritual world (Vaikuntha or Hari-dhama).<br />
<br />
In the Brahma-samhita he is said to be another form of Maha-Vishnu, and is <br />
<br />
compared to a yogurt. Yogurt is nothing but milk, yet it is not milk. As <br />
<br />
yogurt is prepared when milk is mixed with a culture, the form of Shiva <br />
<br />
expands when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in touch with material <br />
<br />
nature. Since Shiva and Vishnu are aspects of one God, Shiva occurs as one of <br />
<br />
Vishnu's names listed in the Vishnu-sahasranama.<br />
<br />
The original father, Krishna, says, aham bija-pradah pita: &quot;I am the <br />
<br />
seed-giving father.&quot; That pita (father) is Lord Shiva, Shambhu, and material <br />
<br />
nature (goddess Durga) is considered the mother. By their sexual union are all <br />
<br />
conditioned souls inserted into the material nature. The impregnation of <br />
<br />
material nature is wonderful because at one time innumerable living beings are <br />
<br />
conceived. Bhago jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate (Shvetashvatara <br />
<br />
Upanishad 5.9). In this way Shiva is connected with both creation and <br />
<br />
destruction. Because of his marginal position between material and spiritual <br />
<br />
realm he is seemingly full of contradictions but these are reconciled on the <br />
<br />
transcendental level.<br />
<br />
Ananta Shesha<br />
<br />
Some of the Nagas are many-headed. Ananta, also called Shesha, the king of the <br />
<br />
Nagas, has unlimited heads. According to the Bhagavata Purana 5.25.3, He is <br />
<br />
the source of Rudra, an expansion of Shiva. When Krishna lists the most <br />
<br />
prominent representatives of His power, He says, ananta casmi naganam - &quot;among <br />
<br />
the Nagas I am Ananta&quot; (Bhagavad-gita 10.29).<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear Lord, at the end of each millennium &lt;here Brahma's life&gt; the Supreme <br />
<br />
Personality of Godhead Garbhodakashayi Vishnu dissolves everything manifested <br />
<br />
within the universe into His belly. He lies down on the lap of Shesha Naga, <br />
<br />
from His navel sprouts a golden lotus flower on a stem, and on that lotus Lord <br />
<br />
Brahma is created. I can understand that You are the same Supreme Godhead. I <br />
<br />
therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 4.9.14)<br />
<br />
Ananta is called Shesha as He is the residue or remainder of the universe <br />
<br />
during cosmic dissolutions. He is elaborately described in the Bhagavata <br />
<br />
Purana, 5th khanda, chapter 25. Ultimately He will destroy the world: &quot;At the <br />
<br />
time of the final devastation of the complete universe &lt;the end of the <br />
<br />
duration of Brahma's life&gt;, a flame of fire emanates from the mouth of Ananta <br />
<br />
(...). (Bhagavata Purana 2.2.26)<br />
<br />
Sage Patanjali, the author of Yoga-sutras, is considered by some to be an <br />
<br />
incarnation of Shesha. He is the author of the Mahabhashya, the celebrated <br />
<br />
commentary on the Grammar of Panini, and a defense of that work against the <br />
<br />
criticisms of philosopher Katyayana. His name allegedly represents that he <br />
<br />
fell as a small snake from heaven into the palm of Panini (pata - fallen, <br />
<br />
anjali - palm).<br />
<br />
South Indian Vaishnava philosopher and spiritual leader Ramanuja (11th <br />
<br />
century) is also considered an incarnation of Shesha.<br />
<br />
Balarama<br />
<br />
&quot;The foremost manifestation of Krishna is Sankarshana, who is known as Ananta. <br />
<br />
He is the origin of all incarnations within this material world. Previous to <br />
<br />
the appearance of Lord Krishna, this original Sankarshana will appear as <br />
<br />
Baladeva, just to please the Supreme Lord Krishna in His transcendental <br />
<br />
pastimes.&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 10.1.24)<br />
<br />
&quot;According to expert opinion, Balarama, as the chief of the original quadruple <br />
<br />
forms, is also the original Sankarshana. Balarama, the first expansion of <br />
<br />
Krishna, expands Himself in five forms: (1) Maha-Sankarshana, (2) <br />
<br />
Karanabdhishayi, (3) Garbhodakashayi, (4) Kshirodakashayi, and (5) Shesha. <br />
<br />
These five plenary portions are responsible for both the spiritual and <br />
<br />
material cosmic manifestations. In these five forms Lord Balarama assists Lord <br />
<br />
Krishna in His activities. The first four of these forms are responsible for <br />
<br />
the cosmic manifestations, whereas Shesha is responsible for personal service <br />
<br />
to the Lord. Shesha is called Ananta, or unlimited, because He assists the <br />
<br />
Personality of Godhead in His unlimited expansions by performing an unlimited <br />
<br />
variety of services. Shri Balarama is the servitor Godhead who serves Lord <br />
<br />
Krishna in all affairs of existence and knowledge. Lord Nityananda Prabhu, who <br />
<br />
is the same servitor Godhead, Balarama, performs the same service to Lord <br />
<br />
Gauranga by constant association.&quot; (Chaitanya Charitamrta, Adi-lila 5.10, <br />
<br />
purport by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada)<br />
<br />
Balarama appeared as Krishna's older brother and took part in Krishna's <br />
<br />
childhood pastimes in Vrindavana. He is the first direct expansion of Krishna. <br />
<br />
Balarama only had one wife, Revati, daughter of King Raivata, and by her He <br />
<br />
had two sons, Nishatha and Ulmuka. He is represented as having fair <br />
<br />
complexion, and clad in a dark-blue vest (nilavastra). His special weapons are <br />
<br />
the club (khetaka or saunanda), the plow (hala), and the pestle (musala). Thus <br />
<br />
He is called Phala, Hala, Halayudha (&quot;plow-armed&quot;), Halabhrit, Langali <br />
<br />
(&quot;plow-bearer&quot;), Sankarshana (&quot;one who attracts everything&quot;), Musali <br />
<br />
(&quot;pestle-holder&quot;). As he has a palm for a banner, he is called Taladhvaja. He <br />
<br />
represents guru-tattva, the principle of spiritual master.<br />
<br />
&quot;May the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Dhanvantari <br />
<br />
relieve me from undesirable eatables and protect me from physical illness. May <br />
<br />
Lord Rsabhadeva, who conquered His inner and outer senses, protect me from <br />
<br />
fear produced by the duality of heat and cold. May Yajna protect me from <br />
<br />
defamation and harm from the populace, and may Lord Balarama as Shesha protect <br />
<br />
me from envious serpents.&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 6.8.18)<br />
<br />
&quot;The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Freed from all sinful reactions are <br />
<br />
those who rise from bed at the end of night, early in the morning, and fully <br />
<br />
concentrate their minds with great attention upon My form; your form; this <br />
<br />
lake; this mountain; the caves; the gardens; the cane plants; the bamboo <br />
<br />
plants; the celestial trees; the residential quarters of Me, Lord Brahma and <br />
<br />
Lord Shiva; the three peaks of Trikuta Mountain, made of gold, silver and <br />
<br />
iron; My very pleasing abode &lt;the ocean of milk&gt;; the white island, <br />
<br />
Shvetadvipa, which is always brilliant with spiritual rays; My mark of <br />
<br />
Shrivatsa; the Kaustubha gem; My Vaijayanti garland; My club, Kaumodaki; My <br />
<br />
Sudarshana disc and Pancajanya conchshell; My bearer, Garuda, the king of the <br />
<br />
birds; My bed, Shesha Naga; My expansion of energy the goddess of fortune; <br />
<br />
Lord Brahma; Narada Muni; Lord Shiva; Prahlada; My incarnations like Matsya, <br />
<br />
Kurma and Varaha; My unlimited all-auspicious activities, which yield piety to <br />
<br />
he who hears them; the sun; the moon; fire; the mantra omkara; the Absolute <br />
<br />
Truth; the total material energy; the cows and brahmanas; devotional service; <br />
<br />
the wives of Soma and Kashyapa, who are all daughters of King Daksha; the <br />
<br />
Rivers Ganges, Sarasvati, Nanda and Yamuna &lt;Kalindi&gt;; the elephant Airavata; <br />
<br />
Dhruva Maharaja; the seven rshis; and the pious human beings.&quot; (Bhagavata <br />
<br />
Purana 8.4.17-24)<br />
<br />
Although Garuda enmity toward serpents is known from this verse it is clear <br />
<br />
that both Garuda and Shesha Naga are servants of the Lord Vishnu, or Krishna.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
Although this overview of the position of a Serpent in different traditions is <br />
<br />
far from exhaustive the conspicuous similarity of accounts from different <br />
<br />
cultural contexts hints that the Vedic tradition spread in the distant past <br />
<br />
over large parts of the world. This is also supported by the tradition itself.<br />
<br />
In this article we have traced the Serpent in various traditions, places and <br />
<br />
contexts which ultimately lead us to the transcendental realm. On this level <br />
<br />
the duality of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; ceases to exist as everything is of absolute <br />
<br />
nature. This puts an end to the Serpent controversy.<br />
