<br />
<br />
Roel, here is something of &quot;divine nature&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
No one can dispute the fact that the Bible is the most amazing book ever to be written. It has been translated into more languages, it has been read more times, and it has more copies in print than any other book in the history of mankind. No other book has touched as many lives, no other work of history or science has remained relevant for such a tremendous length of time. And I say relevant, because no one has ever proven it a fake.  <b>EVER!  </b>  So many people claim and claim that it is a myth, yet no one can even put a dent in it. Moses wrote the Pentateuch nearly 3500 years ago. Scientific evidence is surfacing today that endorses the claims made in the Bible.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point is, the Bible was  <b>&quot;divinely inspired&quot;. </b>  No human has ever written a book that has even come close to achieving one mere percent of the success the Bible has.  <b>That's a fact!</b>   <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
<br />
Let me add the  <b>&quot;Bible Code&quot; </b>  that unlocks a deeper symbolic and spiritual meaning behind the literal words of the text, was placed there by a supernatural act,  <b>UNBEKNOWN TO THE MEN WHO ACTUALLY PENNED THE TEXT.</b></div>

</div>Why not? Personally I think it's a worthless piece of junk. It's at its best a asorted collection of fairytales, myths and historical events. It contains historical flaws and contradictions. The only thing I find amazing about the bible is the fact that so many people live by its word. Sure it's the best selling book ever, but that does not mean I have to like it. Celine Dion is said to be the best selling artist, but I sure in hell ain't playing her music all day  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

Hi Roel,<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

			I don't understand how you, with your scientific background, can agree.

	</div>
</div>Perhaps the source of disagreement lies more in the definition of &quot;divine&quot; than it does anything else?  If you are terribly scarred by discussions of a classical view of God, then perhaps we simply need to view &quot;divine&quot; as being a higher level system to our 3x3 Matrix Universe of Massive SpaceTime?  Try to erase the connotations you ascribe to God from tired religious metaphors and teachings, and instead view it, scientifically, as a SYSTEM that is at the next highest level of context from the SYSTEM that we are immersed in.<br />
As to why I agree:  Something I have been trying to get across to you, Roel, is the concept of balance between extremes. ALL systems within our universe exhibit such balance, for it is the very basis of Conservation of Energy and Momentum laws.  Therefore, all of this evidence points to balance in how we develop beliefs as being not only reasonable, but required for us to evolve.  Blind faith in a God that is going to take care of everything is stupid. Blind faith in science, such that one always demands proof before one can accept the possibility of something being true, is just as stupid. They are both extremist views, and the universe does not operate well at such extremes. The &quot;right answer&quot; is a balance between the two.  That is the path that I take. I accept, and utilize, principles of BOTH science and spirituality, because I see them as two complementary (balancing) means to achieve the same result.  If you cling to only science, Roel, and completely reject spirituality, I am afraid that you are just as bad as people who reject science and cling to only the &quot;wisdom&quot; of their chosen religion.  Extremism, in ALL its forms, is on its way out.<br />
<br />

</div>Again, it is the meaning behind the word that matters.  Please give me your feedback on viewing &quot;divine&quot; as being nothing more than a higher level of context beyond the universe we live in.  What if this was how we viewed &quot;divine&quot;?  Would it not make sense, especially within the context of how we see natural laws structured in our universe (i.e. our universe is a giant &quot;system of systems&quot;)?<br />

			There is something which you call &quot;divine&quot; for no apparent reason and then you say it's being scientifically validated now. That's the worst example of science I've seen since kindergarten.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>The reason is not apparant to you because you have not yet accepted the fact that our universe acts in a manner to balance extremes. Ignoring &quot;divine&quot; and continuing my &quot;higher level system context&quot;... I  <i>KNOW</i> there is a higher-level system context to what we perceive as our universe.  The reason I know is because ALL EVIDENCE from our scientific inquiries tells us that &quot;stuff&quot; is self-similar, fractally-organized systems embedded within larger systems. Can you point to ANY evidence that would suggest this is not true?  You cannot.  All things are connected, and any one thing you point to is a &quot;subsystem&quot; of some larger system.  And so, scientifically, if I ponder our entire universe as a whole, the evidence suggests that there is a higher-level context (an &quot;external system&quot;) which actually controls and affects the system of our universe.  Call it divine?  If you must.... I just like the higher level system view.<br />
Kindergarten science? C'mon Roel!  I know you better than that!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" />  The concepts I am describing above are well-founded in systems engineering.  And the raw facts are that scientific inquiry has been, and continues, to validate the DEEPER scientific meanings inherent in the material from many religious and mystic traditions.  As I mentioned before with respect to Dark Energy... the dogmatic scientists of even 10 years ago would have said &quot;there is NO evidence for any sort of mysterious force that controls the universe.&quot;  And those same scientists are now beginning to change their tune.  Why?  EVIDENCE!<br />
<br />
<br />
You really might want to open your horizons, Roel.  I understand your aversion to the &quot;old stories&quot; of religions and how they tried to control people.  Anyone with a scientific view of things WOULD have such an aversion.  Hell, that is the same aversion that caused me to renounce my Catholic faith.  But that does NOT mean that ALL of the material from any given faith is hogwash.  As I have also said before: The first book of Genesis is actually a treatise on advanced physics, once you clear away the &quot;storybook&quot; elements.<br />

God is housed in a computer at this day level.<br />
<br />
<br />
So in-part, what we are perceiving as God, is modulated by other agencies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not this government, but other realms.<br />

What is to say that in later time, since more than likely people are parts of the God manufacturing structure, that  God does not move his presence to another office?</div>

</div>Hey Ray, I do agree with you on this but I see where Roel is coming from too. I think some of the posts above are refering to an all mighty power that has a direct bearing on our souls existance. I can't dispute that there very well may be a greater system than the ones we perceive and I think my existance is a subsystem of that system and would not be possible without that system. However, I tend to disagree with the notion that any part of a greater system is going to judge me once I have died and I don't see why it should be refered to as devine. If a greater system exists then I tend to believe it is balanced but I doubt it would be balanced by an ultimate &quot;good&quot; and an ultimate &quot;bad&quot;, that's just to simple... and I know for sure it would not offer 13 virgins (or whatever that is)  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /></div>

<br />
I've been reading &quot;Conversations with God&quot; by Neale Donald Walsch.  The &quot;God&quot; in his book compared spirituality with religion.  In spirituality, critical thinking is encouraged as you constantly discover Who You Are and Who You Want To Be.  Change is a part of this equation.<br />
<br />
<br />
  With religion, there is a belief in fundamental, unchanging truths.  What is required is the acceptance of long established beliefs.  Critical thinking is *NOT* desired because the religion can not survive if people are always coming up with new truths that may conflict with what has always been believed.  The idea is -- These truths have been found, these were found by holy men a long time ago, so just accept these and end your search, anything else is merely the work of the devil.<br />
<br />
<br />
  While there are certainly some spiritual gems in the Bible, I too shudder about those worshipping this manmade golden idol they've made out of it.</div>

			Perhaps the source of disagreement lies more in the definition of &quot;divine&quot; than it does anything else?
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Well, perhaps. Let me put it this way: I don't think a higher form of intelligence responsible for our existence.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">

			As to why I agree: Something I have been trying to get across to you, Roel, is the concept of balance between extremes.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I understand what you're trying to get across. I was surprised by the fact that you agreed that there's evidence for &quot;the divine&quot;, while there isn't. Now again, I'm not saying science is capable of explaining everything. I just don't see why we have to explain the unknown by calling it god, or the divine.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">

			Blind faith in science, such that one always demands proof before one can accept the possibility of something being true, is just as stupid.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>When you put it that way: yes. But to me there is no reason to believe that there is such thing as a god or any other form of higher intelligence. I've never seen, heard of felt anything that would suggest its existence. It's not my &quot;blind faith in science&quot; that keeps me from believing. I can accept the <b>possibility</b> of something being true without having any evidence, but in my opinion the next step should always be finding evidence to confirm that it actually is true.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			If you cling to only science, Roel, and completely reject spirituality, I am afraid that you are just as bad as people who reject science and cling to only the &quot;wisdom&quot; of their chosen religion.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I don't &quot;cling&quot; to science at all, nor do I really reject spirituality. I can just as easily &quot;reject&quot; a scientific fact when I think the reasoning or evidence is insufficient. And that is precisely what I think is the case with most, if not all, religions.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>The meaning of the word &quot;divine&quot; is clear. There's hardly any room for misinterpretation of the word as it has only one meaning. What you are doing is giving the word a whole different meaning.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>You were missing my point. Like I already said, the word &quot;divine&quot; has a certain meaning. You just took &quot;divine&quot; out of its own context and claimed that it's scientifically being validated. So when you ask...<br />
<br />

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Perhaps, but I think what's important here is the way we define this &quot;mysterious force that controls the universe&quot;. It more or less implies that there's an intelligent force at hand and I don't think that's what most scientists found evidence for. Or do you think we can expect &quot;Q&quot; paying us a visit any time soon?  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /><br />

</div>I don't think that will be necessary. I'm probably more openminded than you might suspect. However, I do look at things from a more reserved perspective or rather from a distance. I'm interested in religions and spirituality in the same way I'm interested in crop circles and ufo's.<br />

<br />
<br />
The number One.  In this number are the other nine hidden.  It is indivisible, it is also incapable of multiplication; divide one by itself and it stil remains 1.  Multiply 1 by itself and it is still 1 and unchanged.  Thus it is a fitting representative of the great unchangeable Father of all.  Now this number of unity has a two fold nature, and thus forms, as it were, the link between the negative and the positive.  (non-existence / existence )  In its unchangeable one-ness it is scarcely a number; but in its property of capability of addition it may be called the first number of a numerical series.  Now, the zero, 0 , is incapable of even addition, just as also is negative existence.<br />
<br />
<br />
How, then, if 1(one) can neither be multiplied nor divided, is another 1 to be obtained to add to it; in other words how is the number TWO to be found?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;By Reflection Of Itself&quot;  For though 0 be incapable of definition, 1 is definable.  And the effect of a definition is to form a Eidolon, duplicate, or image, of the thing defined.  Thus, then, we obtain a duad composed of 1 and its reflection.  Now we also have the commencement of a vibration established, for the number 1 vibrates alternately from changelessness to definition, and back to changelessness again.<br />
<br />
<br />
From this vibration comes forth the Sephiroth.  In each of the three trinities or triads of the Sephiroth is a duad of opposite sexes, and uniting intellegence which is the result.  ( Must have been before marriage )  In this, the masculine and feminie potencies are regarded as two scales of the balance, and the uniting Sephira as the beam which joins them.  Thus, then, the term balance may be said to symbolize the Triune, Trinity in Unity, and the Unity represented by the central point of the beam.  In the Sephiroth there is a triple Trinity, the upper, lower, and middle.  Now, these three are represented thus:  the Supernal, or highest, by the Crown, Kether; themiddle the King, and the inferior by the queen; which will be the greastest trinity.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the earthly correlatives of these will be the &quot;primum mobile&quot;.  The lower &quot;emanations&quot; relfect the upper &quot;emanations&quot;.  ( The Micro is as the Macro/ The Macro is as the Micro )  The reflections become imperfect as they move away from the original vibration ( copy of a copy of a copy )<br />
<br />
<br />
It is the Trinity which created the world, or, in qabalistic language, the universe was born from a union of the crowned King and queen.  But, according to the Qabalah, before the complete form of the heavenly man ( the ten Sephiroth ) was produced, there were certain primodial worlds created, but these could not subsist, as the equilbrium of balance was not yet perfect, and they were convulsed by the unbalanced forces and destroyed.  These primodial worlds are called the &quot;kings of ancient time,&quot; and &quot;Kings of Edom&quot;  In this sense, Edom is the world of unbalanced force, and Isarael is the balanced Sephiroth ( Genisis xxxvi. 31 ).  This important fact, that worlds were created and destroyed prior to the present creation.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is the vibration as mentioned previously that forms the creation of all that is known and those things that remain unknown.  The vibration forms the basis of all things, light, sound, dna patterns...etc.  When compared to each other all they all just seem &quot;reflections&quot; of each other with some variations depending upon thier purpose.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time Travel has to be woven into the manipulation of the vibration, without disturbing the equilbrium and balance of the Sephiroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a side note, it seems difficult for many to believe in some form of A God, but are quick to believe in Demons.  There are only two words in the entire bible that are capitalized in bold print...&quot;I AM&quot;.  I think regardless of the rest of the bible and all those writings that evolve around the religious texts, this was the one point that God wanted to emphasize.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are many stories of those who were skeptical of esoteric experiences of &quot;magicians&quot; of high magick.  Even when warned not to play with rituals of the practitioners of these ancient Arts, they did so anyway and have gone quite mad.  Magicians of said Arts either have really good imaginations and telekinesis abilities, or they are truly communicating and interacting with all types of spiritual entities.  If the latter be so, then there exists much more than many are aware, or wish to know.</div>

I am speechless! All these great posts! Get it while it lasts Hot Cross Buns...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ray, THAT'S ONE HELL OF A GREAT POST! at explaining a &quot;systems of systems&quot; (subsystem) in terms of balance between extremes... Spirituality needed for evolution and self-similar, fractally-organized systems embedded within larger systems as a whole....<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok Roel lets not use the word divine. Lets look at it from a different perspective.  Take for example &quot;OUR BODY&quot;... The very cells of our body serve us as we in turn serve even a greater source. As Ray says, system inside of a system...<br />
<br />
<br />
Do the cells inside of our body know who it is that they are serving? NO!<br />
<br />
<br />
They only know their given function by definition of their purpose. So in the same breath do we serve a source greater than we can perceive. It is as intelligent as we are, only far more advanced and superior in the fact that it has control of the whole system of systems. It understands its own function as controller...It is the master brain and we are the emulations...(i.e. as OvrLrdLegion put it, a copy of a copy of a copy )(By Reflection Of Itself though 0)<br />
<br />
<br />
As we are evolving and becoming smarter, we are devising ways in which to communicate with our body through scientific medical advances. Perhaps one day we will be able to understand the whole workings of our body, inside and out... For starters, we can certainly hear our own thoughts, cant we?<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no doubt in my mind that the big chief is there completely cognizant and coherent to every subtle thought/prayer and sparrow that falls...  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /></div>

</div>I couldn't disagree with you more. If this were actually true, and the whole world agreed upon the real meaning of &quot;divine&quot;, then we would not be saddled with differences of religious opinions that leads to murder and mayhem.  Your statement borders on absolutism: The meaning is clear TO YOU, and there is hardly any room for misinterpretation of how YOU view what &quot;divine&quot; means.  But the reality is that all words are described and given context by other words. In your view, it is clear that when you hear &quot;divine&quot; that it must always imply God, and that relates to your experiences in listening to and observing people who are fervent in their religion. So when you say:<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			What you are doing is giving the word a whole different meaning.

	</div>
</div>No, I am not, because the &quot;meaning&quot; of divine is not as clear-cut as you seem to think.  What I am doing is what humans have always done when there is contention about the meaning of a highly-charged word: I am using different words, from different realms, to approach a broader understanding of what the term &quot;divine&quot;  <i>MAY</i> apply to. I am trying to REMOVE the connection between &quot;divine&quot; and &quot;God&quot; that all people seem to dogmatically infer. The connection between &quot;God&quot; and &quot;divine&quot; is not an absolute.  The controlling aspects of man-made religions would like you to THINK that it is absolute, but nothing could be further from the truth.  I am trying to get you to erase that immediate connection of &quot;divine&quot; with &quot;God&quot;, and instead consider that &quot;divine&quot; may have a much broader context, and I am using the context of scientific systems engineering which has accumulated an awful lot of evidence for how systems integrate with one another, and are hierarchical with one another.<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

	</div>
</div>Your own words show what I am talking about. You are apparantly steadfast and dogmatic that divine=God....so much so that you believe this &quot;meaning&quot; (implication) is clear and that this is how all people think when it comes to defining the term.  And to answer your point in this observation: I am trying to remedy the very thing you are complaining about in this sentence.  I am trying to explain the unknown in scientific terms of &quot;systems of systems&quot;, and at the same time I am trying to show that this form of scientific thinking  <i>COULD</i> broaden the space of what we think of when we say &quot;divine&quot;.  In other words, the tired relgious extremists who have co-opted the meaning of divine such that it always implies their notion of God...they are on the way out. Theirs is a very limited, and unscientific view of what the notion of &quot;God&quot; really is.<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

			Let me put it this way: I don't think a higher form of intelligence responsible for our existence.

</div>You might be in for a big surprise.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" />   So....does this also mean that you reject the whole &quot;systems of systems&quot; view I am describing?  Because one eminently leads to the other. If you agree, by all the evidence in our universe you can see around yourself, that we live in a &quot;system of systems&quot;, then there is really no reason to believe that the &quot;system of systems&quot; STOPS at the edge of our phyiscal universe, right?  There would be no reason to believe that there is no super-system outside the context of our universe, right?  <br />
Imagine you and I are two DNA molecules living in someone's body having this same conversation. I am pointing to all the &quot;systems of systems&quot; evidence, all around us in the body we live in. I am pointing to all this evidence to get you to think about the high probability that there is a higher-level system context external to the &quot;universe&quot; of the body we live in. Yet you are telling me that, despite all this evidence around us, you think there is no higher-level context. That &quot;we just are the way we are by accident&quot; and that nothing external to our observed system had any hand in creating us.  And yet when you look at the &quot;systems of systems&quot; from this lower-level context (DNA), clearly you can see that such a view is incorrect.  The DNA molecules are not aware that they live within a human body. Nor do they understand the &quot;divine nature&quot; of that human body, and the human bodies (mother and father) that created the human body they live in. I maintain that the real crux of the word &quot;divine&quot; is simply rooted to the aspects of CREATION.  ANY act of creation is, in my view, divine.  But please do not immediately restrict this view such that it simply MUST have something to do with other people's LIMITED view of a &quot;God&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
So let me know: If you do reject the &quot;systems of systems&quot; view, then fine....we just don't agree on something that a great deal of scientific data shows to be true.  But if you DO accept the &quot;systems of systems&quot; view, I would like to understand what  <i>YOUR</i> beliefs are with regard to what kind of system exists above the level of context of our perceived universe.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>You do not see the omnipresent evidence of &quot;systems of systems&quot; structure in our observable universe as a good enough reason to believe there is a system with a higher level of context? You are a higher-level context to your DNA. And so you see no reason to believe that you are an element within an even higher level of context?  It would seem that you are, literally, throwing out ALL the evidence that is our universe!<br />

	</div>
</div>Again: You do not think that the &quot;systems of systems&quot; structure of everything around us is not in the least bit suggestive that we might live within a higher level context?  That seems quite odd to me.  It almost seems as if your idea of perception stops at the boundaries of your body, and that you do not see yourself as living within the contexts of: Community, city, country, continent, planet, solar system, galaxy, universe.<br />

			Like I already said, the word &quot;divine&quot; has a certain meaning. You just took &quot;divine&quot; out of its own context and claimed that it's scientifically being validated.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I am doing nothing more than trying to dissociate the word &quot;divine&quot; with the tired concepts of what people have claimed God to be. That link is not absolute, and not permanent, and the only people who have a vested interest in making you think it is absolute are the religious extremists who want to TELL YOU what &quot;divine&quot; means.  If I am correct that &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Spirituality&quot; are two extremes from which creation can occur, then there MUST be a scientific view of what constitutes &quot;divine&quot; just as there is obviously already a spiritual view of what constitutes &quot;divine&quot;.  Coming to a true understanding of what is &quot;divine&quot; should result in a balance of these two views... because balance of extremes is how everything else works in our universe of Energy.<br />

			I'll take your word for it. It still contains flaws and contradictions though
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>And wouldn't you find it highly likely that the flaws and contradictions were introduced by the many levels of TRANSLATION performed on the original text?  In fact, this is precisely why people who have discovered the scientific underpinnings of Genesis have only been able to do so by studying the book in its native Hebrew.  There is a reason for this: Hebrew is a very unique language because of its formal mathematical constructs.  Like other languages, it has a visual form (shape of the letters) and auditory form (sound of the letters). But it also has a third element, and that is a numerical value of the letters.  This is the connection to &quot;universal&quot; science.  Furthermore, the way letters are combined to form words, and from these come meanings, are mathematically rigorous.  When you study Genesis, mathematically, using the Hebrew language that it was written in, all of the &quot;flaws and contradictions&quot; fall away. What you are left with is a scientific, mathematical treatise of dimensionality and the process of Creation.<br />
When you read Genesis in the translated (how many times?) King James version....or any other tranlated version, you are essentially reading a second hand (or third....or 10th....or 100th hand) telling of the original story.  Ever play the game where one person initiates a story, and each person in the circle re-tells the story to the person next to them?  Isn't it amazing how DIFFERENT the story is when it has gone all the way around the circle?  Is there any reason to NOT think that such distortions and errors are also present in the translated versions of the Bible?<br />

</div>Science doesn't care if there's a God or not.  Science is not trying to disprove God, however, there are many religions that try to disprove or adapt science for their own ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
I want to make a comment about a line of reasoning that I've seen in this thread twice now from two different people.  It's one of those arguments that sounds like it could be reasonable, but actually has no logical merit whatsoever.  It's the argument where you say &quot;look at our cells, they work for us and don't know it, therefore isn't it possible that we're in the same boat as those cells&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, the one is completely unrelated to each other.  Yes, our cells interact in a certain way.  That they're a subset of a larger organism doesn't mean that we therefore must be.  Because if that's true, then the same logic must be true down the other way.  So, individual cells (or DNA strands) are part of a larger system, so doesn't it follow logically that there must be a smaller system within them?  Okay, so there's constituent components of a cell, so it is?  Well, the same must be true of those smaller elements, too.  By exactly the same logic.  And, as such, we discover that a cell nucleus is made up of smaller subsystems. And those subsystems must be part of even smaller subsystems.  And so on, infinitely, until we get to a stage were even an electron would be comparatively the same size as the Milky Way is to us.  And still there would have to be more systems.  And infinitely higher and higher, too.  If that argument were logically sound, that is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, it's comparing things that don't bear much comparison.  It really is exactly the same logic as could lead me to declare that I've noticed that all dogs have four legs.  And my table has four legs.  Is it, therefore, unreasonable for me to assume that my table will fetch me my pipe and slippers?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure you can see the flaw in the logic with that one.</div>

</div>I don't really see why I should continue, given that you seem to wave-off as irrelevant the scientific connections that I have described are going on.  The mathematics of fractal geometry and Chaos (non-linear) dynamics match-up with nature...much more accurately than our earlier, linear models of nature.  The theory of energy as information and information as energy is &quot;out there&quot; and supported by a lot of great minds.  Once again, we even see evidence to this in the fact that the same mathematics used to describe thermodynamic entropy have been shown to apply to information coding and retrieval over discrete noiseless channels.  You either seem to reject these links outright, or toss them away as irrelevant. And then you go on to make &quot;bold&quot; statements that take the discussion away from discussing the evidence I have presented to you on these subjects.<br />

</div> Yep...that's bold...and it is also BS.   <i>COMPLETELY</i> unrelated to each other, are they?  Now how can that be that they are COMPLETELY unrelated to each other, when one can obvious see one huge RELATIONSHIP in that one thing is an internal subsystem of the other.  The very fact that one system contains the other means they are likely HIGHLY related to each other....certainly not COMPLETELY unrelated to each other, as you say.  So we have defined one big relationship between the two right there, and I bet we can find more.  Aha! They are both related in that the &quot;network architecture&quot; is the prevailing theme in both systemic realms.  The human body is composed of networks of nerve fibers, networks of arteries and veins, etc.  And the DNA molecule is essentially composed of a network of amino acid molecules, linked in triplet codons.  Should we go on with how the two are less than completely unrelated to each other?  OK. Another common relationship between the two is that both the human body and DNA exhibit the mathematical structure of the Golden Mean Spiral (Phi). We could go on and on, but suffice it to say that your bold statement of the two being completely unrelated is highly questionable in its truthfulness.  But now I suppose you will just say this is more of your &quot;flowery language&quot;, and that you didn't really mean they were &quot;completely&quot; unrelated.<br />

</div>Really?  This is only the entire fundamental basis for systems theory and systems engineering....comparing and quantifying relationships of systems within systems, via information.  So here again you are throwing away mathematical theory that is well-supported, and which has been put to use in creating the complex systems we have at our service today.

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</div>No, I'm sorry...it is NOT &quot;exactly the same logic&quot;.  You are, once again, only addressing the physical aspect of a comparision between dog legs and table legs.  You have ignored the functional aspect of the two systems, namely what functions the legs serve.  The Functional Architecture of a system is every bit as information-rich as the Physical Architecture of a system.  Take my word for this (or don't and do some research), because I do large-scale, complex systems-of-systems engineering.  I know of what I speak.<br />
You see, your analogy and the logic behind it is based on only the physical dimension similarity of dog legs and table legs.  There is companion logic associated with the Functional and the Operational information domains that is used to discriminate the difference between dogs legs and table legs.  The major function distinction is that dogs legs perform at least two distinct functions, where table legs provide just one:  Table legs &quot;Provide Stability&quot; for their common platform.  For dog's legs, they also &quot;Provide Stability&quot; but they also provide another important function and that is &quot;Provide Mobility&quot;.  This means that the functional architecture of dog's legs have a higher information content, since they perform more functions.  And right here, in this functional domain, we see the logic that would distinguish the reason why your table is not going to fetch your pipe and slippers.... because the table legs do not fulfill (by design) the &quot;Provide Mobility&quot; function.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are other logical imperatives that show up in the Operational domain of information that I could discuss, but I think I have made my point...<br />
<br />

</div>No, actually I do not see any flaw in my logic, especially given the analysis I have provided above.  Perhaps you can tell me what is wrong with my &quot;systems of systems&quot; triplex model, where any system is described in 3 orthogonal information domains: Operational, Functional, and Physical.  If you can show some flaw in this logic, then I can show you some references for how it is becoming a defacto standard for systems engineering.  Who knows...there might be some big consulting work for you in it if you can show us how everything we are doing is based on flawed logic?<br />
Oh yeah....note the proliferation of &quot;triplex orthogonal constructs&quot; throughout all of this (i.e. Operational-Functional-Physical).  It is a central organizing theme in the language of Nature and Creation.<br />

</div>Well, I'm not actually going to look back over this thread at the moment to check this, but I don't remember doing any of that.  In fact, I seem to remember asking you to expand on one or two things, and to explain with more depth with regards to other things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, I disregarded things that I found to be logically flawed or pointless, such as the statement that consiousness is countinuous, but only if you discount when it's not.  You can, of course, challenge my assessment of what you've said.  Maybe I've misunderstood and you could explain further.  Maybe you think there's something wrong with my argument.  Maybe you think I've applied my logic incorrectly, and you could show me where.  If you think I'm being unfair, say so.<br />

</div>Yup, well, you got me there.  I don't think, though, that I have ever attacked you, personally.  Rather, I've stuck to your arguments.  Wheras you have attacked me, personally.  You'll also  notice (from the bit with the &quot;flowery&quot; quote) that when I was challenged on it, I was polite and I apologised immediately.  Maybe we're not as similar as you'd at first think.<br />

</div>Because that's not what we're analysing them for.  You have to bear in mind the <i>purpose</i> of our comparison.  We're comparing DNA strands (or whatever it is the other guy said) to humans in terms of intelligence to see whether it's credible that there is a higher intelligence outside of ourselves, are we not?  I mean, if we're just saying that it's true that things can be subsystems of other things then I don't think that really counts as proof of anything beyond what our senses tell us.  Or, indeed, a statement that rates highly on the &quot;wow&quot; list.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I'll happily grant you that DNA strands are a subsystem of the human body.  I'll also offer that compacted fecal matter is an essentail subsystem, too.  And that my particular body is a subsystem of my neighbourhood.  And of my circle of friends.  And my country.  And the planet.  If this is logically leading me down the path to believeing in higher intelligences, then I'm not seeing it.  In other words, &quot;so what?&quot;<br />

</div>I'm not debating the mathematical theory, I'm debating whether it's applicable to this argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, I could say that spirituality was like a vertical axis and that intelligence was like a horizontal axis.  If you take those two points and draw a line between them, then you have God.  So, to discover how big God is, you take the lengths of the other two axes, squared them, added them together, and then did the root.  And then, if you disputed this, would you be disputing what I had said, and my choice of illustration/proof, or would you be disputing Pythagoras' Theorem itself?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not disputing that things can be subsystems of each other.  Exactly how much of a stupid argument would that be?<br />

</div>No, actually.  You cannot, after all, say that the dog and the table are completely unrelated.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's true that I ignored the functional aspect of the legs, but so what?  What functional aspect do humans and DNA strands have in common?  To replicate themselves, right?  Which, again, seems to have little to do with higer intelligences.  Unless said higher intelligences also plan to just reproduce themselves.<br />

My point is this: The fact that humans contain a subsystem of DNA strands does not logically lead to the conclusion that it is likely that there is a divine intelligence out there.  If you can show me how this point is wrong, then do so.</div>

</div>You can disagree all you want, but it will do you no good, since what I'm saying is a fact. Now I'm usually very careful with claiming things as facts (for one thing I always use phrases like &quot;My personal opinion...&quot;), but in this case I'm 100% sure that I'm right. The word &quot;divine&quot; has only one meaning and hey, I didn't make up the English language. It means as much as &quot;supreme being&quot;, nothing more and nothing less. I've even crossreferenced it, just to be sure.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

</div>I tend to agree with you when you speak of a higher-level system. However, in my opinion it's not intelligent and not what people would call &quot;a creator&quot;. I realize that you're trying to tell me that I should let go of my traditional view of &quot;divine&quot;, but I suggest you let go of the word &quot;divine&quot; since it's inextricably connected to the traditional way of thinking. Let me illustrate what I'm saying by providing you with two points:<br />
<br />
<br />
1) There's no evidence whatsoever for the existence of a supreme being, god, or godlike figure.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) I'm open to this new theory of &quot;systems of systems&quot;, but I still <b>think</b> that it does not imply that a possible higher level system would have to be intelligent.<br />

<br />
OK, I'll continue if you insist.  But can we agree that this conversation appears to be centered on &quot;systems of systems&quot; comparisons, especially human-to-DNA, with regard to establishing basis of scientific evidence for a higher-level, intelligent system?  At least that is what I think we are talking about.  I could be wrong, because you see I often have to address some of your own bold statements that have logical flaws or are otherwise pointless.  Maybe that's an overuse of flowery words that get in the way of my comprehension of your point.  Don't worry, I'll use some examples as I try to clean-up some other issues so we can focus on the point above (if you agree that this is what we are talking about).... first:<br />
<br />

</div>If you've taken it personally, then I do apologize (polite enough, Mr. Manners?).  But I guess this is my &quot;flowery words&quot; way to get you to come out of your shell and share some of your beliefs of what constitutes our higher-level system, in terms of what sorts of power and influence it may have over us.  Call me guilty of &quot;baiting&quot; you, and I'd probably admit to it.  I guess that's my style. Don't take it personally, but maybe instead share some of your personal beliefs.  It could lively up the debate.<br />

</div>See, this is where we get sidetracked. You are now applying conditional logic with the basis of analysis as your condition.  However, your initial statement (perhaps flowery) drew an unconditional implication..namely, that of being COMPLETELY unrelated.  I simply gave a few examples of how your unconditional was not true, and therefore was an invalid argument.  Now you want to go into a grey area discussion of the conditions of analysis and comparisions, when my point was simply to refute your statement that they were completely unrelated.  And I think I have done that, so I will move on.<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			We're comparing DNA strands (or whatever it is the other guy said) to humans in terms of intelligence to see whether it's credible that there is a higher intelligence outside of ourselves, are we not? I mean, if we're just saying that it's true that things can be subsystems of other things then I don't think that really counts as proof of anything beyond what our senses tell us.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>It is a foothold from which logical inference can be enjoyed.  We use this method all the time in the sciences to develop new, testable theories.  The fact that DNA and humans are systemically related as subsystem-supersystem is the first realization we make on this road of logical inference. The other common relationships I cited are more fodder for this foothold (e.g. they self-replicate, they employ network structures....all are true and all are evidence of how they are not COMPLETELY unrelated).  Now let's look at more potential, valid relationships between the two, for sake of the higher-level intelligence argument: I would assume that you consider yourself to be intelligent, and that we consider the human species to be intelligent.  And in your abilities of intellect (which establish your intelligence) I suppose you would agree that you exercise certain standards of intelligence over your DNA subsystem, right?  In short, you use your intelligence to make calculated decisions of who you choose to procreate with. In fact, if you choose to NEVER procreate then this shows you, an intelligent being, have a supreme measure of power over your DNA, and whether your particular &quot;brew&quot; of DNA will get to &quot;live on&quot; in a new creation.  So now we have established another valid relationship between humans and DNA, where you were saying they were completely unrelated and not worthy of comparision.  We have established that you are intelligent and you have a certain amount of power over the &quot;universe&quot; of your DNA subsystem. And this is a result of the system-subsystem relationship analysis.  Hmmm...the plot thickens.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> <br />

	</div>
</div>You are again arguing from a &quot;form&quot; (physical) standpoint to the exclusion of the functional standpoint.  Do DNA and compacted fecal matter have the same subsystem functionality? I can tell you right off the bat that they do not, as DNA can perform the function of organized, self-replication, thanks to its fractal structure. DNA is recombinant, is it not?  I don't think fecal matter is recombinant.  OK....so enough crap  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />  Let's keep the comparisions between humans and DNA, because they share functional self-similarities.  Your crappy  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />  argument is a functionally invalid comparison.

</div>Hang with me.  Keep walking down the path, because I am hopeful the light is getting brighter.  I hope you will agree that we, as humans, are an intelligent supersystem to our DNA. And that furthermore, as an intelligent supersystem, we hold a certain amount of creative power over our DNA. And CREATION and CREATIVE POWER is the name of this path I am walking you down.

</div>Flippant non-sequitor.  So here is another example of how I think we get off track.  Let's review where these statements came from, because I read your flippancy in this answer as a means to deflect from having to admit the point I was making that lead to this remark.  Here's the chronology:<br />
You said:<br />

	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">

<br />

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>And then my ENTIRE statement, which was in response to your implication that we should not investigate comparisons was:<br />

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>And then you come back with your flippant remark trying to make it seem as if I was saying the basis of systems theory was only human-DNA systemic comparisions.  However, you can see that my added words clarify what I am talking about, namely, that there is a body of knowledge and practice (systems engineering) that relies heavily on comparisions of systems and their subsystems. Comparitive relationships, and the information that define them.  So I was pointing to this body of knowledge as a means to logically counter your argument that the human-DNA systemic relationship were things that don't bear much comparison.  So all of this chat, and your flippant remark, was apparantly trying to draw me away from the fact that I have showed you MORE than one way in which humans and DNA are related, and that the more of these relationships we &quot;find&quot;, the more relevant is their comparison.  Instead of being flippant and trying to make me look silly, you could just say &quot;OK, I guess you are right, there are some valid comparisions. They are not, as I stated, COMPLETELY unrelated.&quot;  Such admissions would prevent me from having to explain all my reasonings for my arguments (and maybe save a few keystrokes) in the future.<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>OK, now I am unclear on what you are admitting to.  First, I was never one who said that a dog and a table are completely unrelated. In fact, I showed they both possess common functional relationships in that their legs both &quot;provide stability&quot;.  So is this you way of saying &quot;yes, I was incorrect to use the words 'completely unrelated' in my argument&quot;?<br />

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>So what? Have I not shown that the functional aspects, and their related information, are what provide the discriminating factor for purported logic that would make you think your table was going to fetch your slippers?  So what?  So.... by ignoring the information in the functional architectures of dogs and tables, you have tried to use that comparison to invalidate my comparison of humans and their DNA. Since humans and DNA *do* share common functional architectures, and since dogs and tables *do NOT*, then by ignoring the functional aspects you introduce an argument that is an invalid comparison.<br />

			What functional aspect do humans and DNA strands have in common? To replicate themselves, right? Which, again, seems to have little to do with higer intelligences. Unless said higher intelligences also plan to just reproduce themselves.

</div>Ahhhhhhhh.....NOW we are moving down the path.....NOW we are getting somewhere!  You think it SEEMS to have little to do with higher intelligence. But it appears to me it has a LOT to do with higher intelligence. I think we are in agreement that we humans are a higher form of intelligence to our DNA, right? We DO have the power of intelligent choices in how, or even if, our DNA continues it its existence.  So the fact that humans and DNA both replicate themselves, and the fact that we hold the creative reigns of our DNA via our intelligence DOES have something to do with my argument.  It is laying more groundwork for logical inferences of embedded systems.  And as for your statement about higher intelligences than us planning to reproduce themselves.... Did you ever hear the words &quot;in the image and likeness of their creator?&quot;  Comes from a popular book called the Bible.  In fact, Genesis, Book #1...the seminal work, if you can pardon the pun!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /> <br />

			My point is this: The fact that humans contain a subsystem of DNA strands does not logically lead to the conclusion that it is likely that there is a divine intelligence out there. If you can show me how this point is wrong, then do so.

</div>And I think I have made it clear that the system-subsystem physical hierarchy is not the ONLY relationship I am relying on in my inductive process.  It is a big one...it is one that gets a person looking around for other relationships to further investigate the potential links between human and DNA, with regard to a higher-level system to the human body system.  But besides physical systemic relationships, I have also pointed to the important functional systemic relationships.  And I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to the operational systemic relationships.  Actually, the operational domain is where we assess &quot;intelligence&quot;, because this is the domain where Functional and Physical are integrated to achieve goals and objectives. A physical thing is just a hunk of matter...hardly intelligent.  And a function is nothing more than a transformation of input-to-output...while it may appear a bit more &quot;intelligent&quot; than a physical element, it really is not.  But when you mix physical elements and functional elements into an operational, goal-directed environment, you begin to see how intelligence can arise out of the time-based considerations of the operational domain....and chaotic feedback loops....and fractals.<br />
I am &quot;weaving a rug&quot; with regard to information here. I am not arguing about a single strand in that rug, namely that DNA is a subsystem of the human. I am trying to point out ALL the strands in the rug (functional and operational self-similarity, in addition to the physical system-subsystem).  I think we have established that humans and DNA share physical, functional, and operational similarities. We are self-similar (a fractal term) with our DNA in this regard.  And I think we have also established that humans generally agree that we are an intelligent lot, as we execute operational decisions that allow us to flexibly achieve goals and objectives.  And I think we have also established that we, the intelligent supersystem to our DNA, hold a very important power of Creation over that DNA.  We decide whether our DNA will ever get the chance to propagate, and &quot;recombinate&quot; with someone else's DNA.  We exercise creative judgment over our DNA.  If one were to include a functional desscription of what might constitute &quot;divinity&quot;, I would think the main function one would cite would be &quot;the ability to create&quot;.  More on this when I get around to answering Roel's post...it may be a holiday here in the States, but I still have work around the house to get done!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
<br />
I hope you can see the &quot;tapestry&quot; I am weaving or, to use the other analogy, the path I am leading you down.  It's not really a scary path, unless you have an aversion to helping humanity get a better grip on a definition of what may constitute &quot;divinity&quot;.  The relationships of human to DNA seem to show common themes. We are intelligent. We exercise creative power over our DNA.  If all these things are basically &quot;right&quot; from a macrocosm/microcosm point of view in this comparision, then it does not seem exeedingly unlikely that these same forms of relationships could appear between us and the next-higher level supersystem of which we are part (and I think you said you DO agree that there probably is a next-higher system context).<br />
<br />
<br />
And oh yes...another point of mathematical order to note, as to relationships in this inductive process. Examine the spatial/size relationships of the elements we are discussing in this &quot;systems of systems&quot; view.  I'd say the ratios are pretty comparable:  DNA strand is to the entire human body, as the human body is to the entire known universe. Without actually performing a calculation for an exact number, I'd say the scalings in these ratios are fairly close.  We are SO much larger than our DNA, that one could easily see our DNA saying &quot;yeah...I don't see any evidence in our universe that there is a higher-level intelligent being.&quot;  That same vastness of our macrocosmic universe outside our bodies can, and does, lead some of us to the same type of conclusion that we may attribute to our DNA.  Doesn't mean these conclusions are not flawed..it only means that the horizons of observability are SO large as to make it seemingly impractical to &quot;prove&quot;.<br />

</div>Answers: Certainly, and no!  (At least not until I answer your last post and make a few more points on relativistic vs. absolutist points of view).  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />   I know you &quot;get&quot; the basic point I am trying to make about the word... the point being that there ARE &quot;shades of grey&quot; interpretations of such highly contentious words.  And the fact that you seem to be arguing from an absolutist point of view with respect to its definition is what I find interesting, since that does not address the relativistic point I am trying to make.<br />
Give me a few more hours of yardwork and a couple dips in the pool, and then I'll make a few points on your last post, Roel. Maybe a few beers thrown in for good measure!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" />   I'm not trying to convert you, but rather give a bit more scientific reasoning to the argument for what some people mean with respect to &quot;divinity&quot; and a &quot;higher power&quot;.  The key word and relationship is Creation and Creative Power.  More later...<br />

</div>Yes, I acknowledge there are many shades of grey, but the word &quot;divine&quot; still means one thing and one thing only, no matter what you call it and how you describe it. It always implies god, godlike, supreme being, etc. And from that perspective there is no evidence for its existence.<br />

</div>Ahhhh.... OK, I'll try one of Creedo's tactics and speak about myself in the 3rd person:   <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> <br />
Rainman is now refreshed. Furthermore, Rainman is approaching a nize little beer buzz! Rainman likes Memorial Day Holiday.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big grin    :D" /><br />
<br />
<br />
OK, as for a dictionary reference, I think this  <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=divine" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">dictionary.com</a>  set of definitions would do us well in this discussion.  It does seem to cover the aspects that you have discussed, from your point of view of this word having an absolutely unique meaning...100% certain, I believe you said, and if that is not absolutist, I don't know what is!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />   So now in the same, absolutist fashion, let's compare the descriptions in dictionary.com against some of the things you have said about &quot;divine&quot;.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			but the word &quot;divine&quot; still means one thing and one thing only, no matter what you call it and how you describe it.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div> OK, so looking at the reference link defintions we can see, in a very technical sense, that you are incorrect in saying it means &quot;one thing and one thing only&quot;.  Certainly, the reference does contain the &quot;one and only one&quot; definition you are speaking of when it describes the adjective  <i>divine</i> as: &quot;1. Having the nature of or being a deity. and also in 2. Superhuman; godlike.&quot;  Yep..looks like those are the &quot;one&quot; definition you are talking about.  But I am sure you can see, technically, how there are more definitions.  The one that is the MOST different is the intransitive verb  <i>divine</i> given as &quot;2. To have or feel a presage or foreboding.&quot;  Now, you may say this is splitting hairs, as I should know the ONE definition you are talking about, and this is true.  But I did want to point out your technical error in saying there is &quot;one thing and one thing only&quot;.  What can I say? I am technical in my nature!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> <br />
But let's ignore the intransitive verb &quot;other&quot; definition of divine, as I know that is not the one you meant.  Instead, let us look at some of the OTHER alternate definitions given in our reference link, shall we?  We have &quot;3.a. Supremely good or beautiful; magnificent and 3.b. Extremely pleasant; delightful. and even 4. Heavenly; perfect.&quot;  Now, those don't explicity refer to &quot;God, godlike, supreme being, or deity&quot;, now do they?  I guess we could consider these the grey area definitions that I see, where you see 100% certainty.  OK, I give you that &quot;heavenly, perfect&quot; are indirect references to a &quot;place&quot; where a diety may be said to &quot;exist&quot;.  But the definitions for (3) are very explicitly NOT God-referenced.  Again, I am only pointing out the technical errors in your statements.  So your 100% certainty is maybe a little less than 100...and that's OK.  In fact, in my business we are not absolutist enough to think that ANYTHING can be 100% anything.  We can guarantee no loss of human life on commercial aircraft to a very high degree of certainty... we even do it in excess of 99% certainty... thank the divine for those of us who fly!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />  But not 100%.  For safety-critical operational phases, like automatic landing, we can do approximately 99.999956% certainty....not bad, but still not 100%....technically speaking.  But let's move on, shall we (as Rainman takes another long draw on his St. Pauli Girl)  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /><br />

	</div>
</div>OK, so I hope you agree now that it does not  <i>always</i> imply this. Certainly not in the intransitive verb definition, and not even really in the &quot;extremely delightful, pleasant&quot; definition.  In other words, it is open to debate given the variety of definitions.  But I really like that you used these 3 terms of reference...and not just once, but TWICE, as you used them in your initial, long reply to me.  Because the use of these three deity-driven words are EXACTLY what I would like to use to discuss the &quot;shades of grey&quot; interpretations of &quot;divine&quot; that I have spoken of before.  I want to encourage a relativistic line of thought here....not the absolutist line of thought that lead you to make your technically inaccurate assessments of the defintionS (plural) of &quot;divine&quot;. OK?  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> <br />
 <b>God, godlike, supreme being, etc.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Since we are being technical about definitions:  Do these 3 words describe the EXACT same thing? Not really.  They each have their own connotations...both subjective and objective.  Certainly &quot;God&quot; and &quot;godlike&quot; are not the same thing.  Because something is either God itself, or it is not.  Thus &quot;godlike&quot; is something LIKE God, but not really God...that is how I would reasonably distinguish between these shades of grey.  And then &quot;supreme being&quot; moves even further away from the &quot;strict&quot; definition used by the term God.  If God is the white, then supreme being is something a little less white than God in its connotation... and &quot;godlike&quot; is even further to the grey side of God.  THESE are the very shades of grey that I am debating when it comes to a hard/fast, asbolutist definition of the connotations/denotations of the word &quot;divine&quot;.  Could we discuss these shades of grey for awhile, Roel???...that is, if I have convinced you of the fact that there IS room for interpretation of &quot;divine&quot; since there IS more than one definition for it?<br />
<br />
<br />
If the authors of the various dictionaries are permitted to use shades-of-grey words, such as the above three, in their definitions, then this would imply we are not prohibited from (i.e. we are free to) perhaps enhance and/or expand the definition with yet MORE descriptive words.  And in adding some other, descriptive words, maybe we can even get to a more neutral, common definition of &quot;the divine&quot; such that some religions would stop killing each other over it?  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" />   I generally, think this is the process of how language evolves, rather than staying absolutist, and stagnant. Am I wrong?<br />
<br />
<br />
I've gone thru great pains to lay out this explanation, Roel, because I wanted to challenge your assertion that I am &quot;completely redefining&quot; what &quot;divine&quot; means.  I am doing nothing of the sort. I am using some of the existing descriptive words used to define it, and suggesting some others that EXPAND, rather than change altogether, the connotations of what &quot;divine&quot; might mean to given groups of peoples. OK, so are you ready for my suggestions for some words that might augment global human understanding of a &quot;scientific&quot; view of what &quot;divine&quot; may mean?  Here they are:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Of or relating to some entity that possesses and utilizes the power of Creation.&quot;  OK, so I guess I could just boil it down to one additional word: Creation, of the concept of Creative Power. Do you see the grey area I am discussing here?  I know you can see the inference to your &quot;one&quot; definition of divine here, because people who talk about God also attribute to God the &quot;almighty power of creation&quot;.  But it also plays to my side of the grey area, in that it does not exclude other forms of creative power in our universe.  I am simply saying that an alternate, broader connotation of what &quot;divine&quot; means could reasonably be taken to refer to anything that has/weilds creative power is, in some shade of grey, divine.  In fact, this is EXACTLY what the more common teachings of Qabalah ascribe to: The active power of creation is one of the &quot;functional&quot; descriptions of divinity.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure you've been keeping up with my discussion with trollface, and so I am going to merge some of these thoughts here.  I've been speaking of the RELATIONSHIPS between the supersystem of human body and the subsystem of DNA. I've set out some of these relationships that allow us to compare the two systemic levels, and see their inherent self-similarities with one another.  I have distinguished the systems engineering practice of identifying systemic information in the 3 domains of &quot;operational, functional, and physical&quot;.  So now I would submit that your adherence to your &quot;one and only one&quot; definition of divine, which &quot;implies God, godlike, or supreme being&quot; is a definition of divine from a physical sense of &quot;what God IS&quot; (even tho many would say that God is not physical...you get the point...this definition speaks of the &quot;Is-ness&quot; of God, or God's state of BEING).  By suggesting the addition of &quot;Creation&quot; and &quot;Creative Power&quot; to the definition, I am trying to address the definition of &quot;divine&quot; from an alternate information domain: The functional domain.  Functions are based in verbs, and so functional definitions are always given (in the science of systems engineering) as verbs and verb phrases. Since &quot;to create&quot; is definitely a verb phrase, you can probably see that the functional definition of &quot;divine&quot; that I am suggesting by adding &quot;Creation&quot; to the definintion.  Your definition of &quot;God, godlike, supreme being&quot; is addressing the &quot;Is-ness&quot; or state of BEING for divine.  My additional functional definition of divine is addressing what divine &quot;does&quot;...or what God does...and that is to Create.  So where your strict definition addresses state of BEING, my additions address another aspect of divine, namely the state of DOING.  BEING/DOING.  Two sides to one coin.<br />
<br />
<br />
To illustrate my point, we could extend these thoughts into the operational domain as well, and provide a similar keyword pertinent to that domain.  If &quot;state of BEING&quot; describes the Physical domain, and &quot;state of DOING&quot; describes the Functional domain... then we might say that the &quot;state of HAVING&quot; (realization of some objective) would provide an operational domain definition for &quot;divine&quot;.  In fact, there is an entire segment of language theory that concedes the concept of &quot;operational definition&quot;, &quot;functional definition&quot;, and &quot;physical definition&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
So...would you like to discuss the &quot;shades of grey&quot; issue?  And furthermore, would you like to comment on my additional, functional, definition of divinity? Or maybe discuss the orthogonal triplex domains of Operational-Functional-Physical, and their relationship to information science?  I mean, to try to stay on-thread-topic...this thread was initiated to talk about &quot;triplex and triplicates&quot;.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
<br />
And I am sure you see the obvious parallels between my 3x3 Matrix of Massive SpaceTime theory, and the triplex orthogonal information domains (Ops-Func-Phys).  I am still trying to weave all this stuff together....maybe my weaving job is not &quot;professional quality&quot; work, but I do know where I am going and know that I AM (pun!) going to get there, because I possess the Power of Creation!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /><br />
<br />
<br />
Kind Regards....always good discussing with you, Roel, as you do get me thinking and pondering deeply.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

<br />
<br />
Okay, I'm glad you at least partially agree with me now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me review your comments here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind you, English is not my native tongue. However, I think I've told you before that my language skills are pretty good compared to my math and science skills  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

	</div>
</div>Although this may sound a bit awkward coming from my mouth, but understanding the sole meaning of the word &quot;divine&quot; requires more than just your technical insight. You need to interpret the word as it was meant. This might seem to contradict my claim that the word &quot;divine&quot; is not open to interpretation, but it doesn't. The word really has only one meaning and there is only one way to interpret it. Every word that is derived from &quot;divine&quot; is inextricably linked to the original meaning of &quot;divine&quot;.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent">
			The one that is the MOST different is the intransitive verb divine given as &quot;2. To have or feel a presage or foreboding.&quot;
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Although this definition might seem different from the rest, it can easily be reduced to the original meaning of &quot;divine&quot;. Lets take a look at the full description of the intransitive verb, which you conveniently left out of your quote  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

\Di*vine&quot;\, v. i.<br />

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>The first description has a reference to a passage in the bible, so the v.i. is clearly linked to the original meaning of &quot;divine&quot;.<br />

</div>Well... actually they do refer to &quot;God, godlike, supreme being, or deity&quot;. Pretty obviously AND in more than one way, I might add. I don't see how they don't, please enlighten me.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

</div>In danger of sounding cocky, but alas... I'm still 100% certain  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />  Lets see if you can agree with this phrase:<br />
<br />
<br />
 <b>The word &quot;divine&quot;, regardless of its conjugation or context, is inextricably linked to &quot;God, godlike, supreme being, or deity&quot; in one way or the other.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Which is not strange, when you take into account that the word is originally derived from the Latin word for &quot;God&quot;.<br />
<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>I've always had a love-hate relationship with your theories. Not to the extent that I really hate your theories of course, but I usually only agree with them partially.<br />
<br />
<br />
I support the &quot;systems of systems&quot; theory. Excuse my oversimplified summary, but just like you I think the universe acts like a fractal. This is, however, no evidence for what you call Creation. I personally think there was no act of creation, at least, not by an entity. I agree that there could very well be a &quot;higher level system&quot;, but to me it's not capable of creation.<br />
<br />
<br />
After writing the last paragraph I realized that I might just understand what you're getting at. You're refering to the ability of (for instance) a cell, to replicate itself. You could consider that an act of creation and I admit that it would be logical to assume that a higher level system, which we cannot perceive, has the same ability. Am I correct?<br />
<br />
<br />
That still doesn't mean there's evidence for that theory. It remains a theory, that seems logical, but can't be proven. The only thing you can do is make assumptions. Now I know that a lot of assumptions have been made in the history of science, some of which are still current. But let us agree that &quot;the evidence that is the universe&quot; doesn't cover the full load.<br />
<br />
<br />
Divine and Creation have really put me on a wrong track. I hate the idea of having to worship something or someone, especially since there's no reason to it. I also want to add that I think it's safe to asume that if there really is a &quot;creative power&quot;, it does not have a conscience or self awareness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Geesh, sorry Ray, I'm going to quit now... I finished my Duvel and I have to work tomorrow. Looking forward to your reply.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

<br />
Friends<br />
<br />
<br />
I have read all of your points about the divinity however, maybe we are not discussing the right thing. Maybe we should not pay as much attention to the existence of G-d but to our place in existence. I do understand Roel's point of view, yes maybe there are no tangible proof of a Living Breathing Power Above, but maybe there is. This debate could go on and on until....later becomes now. However, since that seems to be the stalwart barrier that keeps us from moving on, let us say that somehow, somewhen that question was answered and that it is no longer of conscequence, what would we do. Would we become ultimately evil, would we become ultimately good, would we start to behave selfishly or philantropically? What would we do?<br />
<br />
<br />
I do believe that it is not up to us to question the unquestionable, we must simply decide whether to accept our place in &quot;the system of subsystems&quot; and do our part or not to do it and try to find our own way. Either way The Great Unknown will not mind, it would simply understand our decision as an act of learning.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I think we should start pondering where am I standing in relation to my beliefs and not if my beliefs are true or false. Once you find your bearings and follow your north regarding your belief system you will never have to discuss G-d's veracity again for you shall know first hand if S/he is out there or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Happy Thoughts fellow campers, summer is near.<br />
<br />
<br />
Until later becomes now.</div>

I was not the one claiming there was ONLY one definition of divine, and as such I was always in partial agreement with you!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> <br />

			Although this may sound a bit awkward coming from my mouth, but understanding the sole meaning of the word &quot;divine&quot; requires more than just your technical insight. You need to interpret the word as it was meant. This might seem to contradict my claim that the word &quot;divine&quot; is not open to interpretation, but it doesn't.

</div>Well, again I am afraid I must inform you that you are technically incorrect....they DO contradict each other. You can't say &quot; you need to interpret the word as it was meant&quot; and then turn around and say &quot;it is not open to interpretation&quot;!  I guess I am going to have to agree to disagree and abandon this, because I cannot hold a debate with someone who clearly contradicts themselves, and then claims he is not contradicting himself!  I'm no Kurt Godel....it makes my brain hurt!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /> <br />

You seem to do the same thing with technical science and logical contradiction....use them when you need to, throw them away when they don't give you what you want.  You might not realize it, but in this attempt to broaden the v.i. version of divine to meet your needs of connecting it to the adj. divine, you are doing the EXACT same thing that I was doing in trying to expand/connect the adj. version of divine to creation!<br />

</div>That is called an EXAMPLE of the word's usage, and it is not accepted as part of the definition.  I have a college degree, Roel, and even though I am an engineer, it required me to pass advanced English classes. I understand the difference between definition and operational example of a word's use.  You are REALLY stretching here....<br />

			I realized that I might just understand what you're getting at. You're refering to the ability of (for instance) a cell, to replicate itself. You could consider that an act of creation and I admit that it would be logical to assume that a higher level system, which we cannot perceive, has the same ability. Am I correct?

</div>I must now ask if you understand the concept of &quot;standard of evidence&quot;.  There are many, and yes, they are very far from being absolutist statements of truth.  If &quot;evidence&quot; was a clear, non-grey-area concept, then we wouldn't need a jury of our peers, and there would be no false convictions, etc.  All you are really saying here is that you choose to adopt the STRICTEST standard of evidence, because it appears you really do not want to believe there might be a God.  Unfortunately, if one adopts the strictest standard of evidence, there is no way to prove anything. For the strictest standards of evidence, when coupled to the concept of mathematical proof, would require that ALL basic assumptions that go into a proof must also be shown to be true by evidence. This leads to an endless loop where you are always having to provide evidence all the way back in the chain of proofs.  So define for me, precisely, your standard of evidence required.  And be careful!  Because you may demand a standard of evidence so high that you would not be able to prove some things you believe about yourself!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /> <br />

</div>Continued discussions always reveal subliminal thoughts...and in this we see it.  This statement shows the level of which you are &quot;reverse-brainwashed&quot; by the tired religions of our world that demand allegiance to their mores and to their God.  Now THIS is evidence of what is going on in your mind, Roel!  Who EVER said you HAD to WORSHIP someone or something that may be God?  I have to agree with your statement, Roel, as I think this is one of the silliest things that religions try to force on people.  Do you really think (if there does happen to be a God) that he/she/it REALLY gives a flying flip whether we worship him/her/it?  In fact, if my logical inference is correct with regard to humans and DNA...it is quite obvious that we DO NOT give a flying flip if our DNA is worshipping us!   <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big grin    :D" />   As long as our DNA is &quot;serving&quot; us in its operational capacity, we don't care if it goes into little DNA churches and celebrates the Last DNA Supper!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> <br />
Sorry, Roel, but this quote seals it for me.  Your mind appears SOOOOO locked into the &quot;absolutist&quot; view of what world religions TELL us we must believe, and how we must behave, with respect to God, that it seems to have affected your ability to consider that there JUST MAY BE an alternate &quot;version&quot; of God... one which is FAR less akin to what man-made religions say God is, and one that is FAR closer to what science would infer about how a higher-level creative system would be. I find this amusingly ironic, because you have resisted the controlling message of the world religions SO MUCH, and so WELL, that they have driven you into an absolutist view that what THEY say God &quot;is&quot; must be what EVERYONE is talking about when they talk of a higher-level state of being.  My own personal analysis tells me there is a middle-ground belief where the integration of science and spirituality yields a balanced solution to Mind/Body, and Time.<br />

Sorry, but you need a little bit more technical logic here, Roel:  You consider yourself conscious, correct?  You consider yourself self-aware, correct?  You possess a power to create another human.  You ARE a higher-level, conscious, self-aware supersystem to your DNA.  Argue in a non-technical manner if you wish, but this is still true.  And thus, your assumption that a higher-level system context to ourselves is definitely NOT conscious or self-aware is tenuous, at best.  If WE are all these things at our level of the &quot;system of systems&quot;, then why would we assume the next higher level is NOT?<br />
Well, Roel... while I do really enjoy debating things with you, I do have a problem with your loose application of technical science, logic, and semantics.  If we both do not adhere to the same level of technical rigor, there is little possibility of us reaching agreement on many issues.  Kind of like having different standards of evidence.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" />   Do you want to keep both of us haranging around &quot;divine&quot; or do you want to debate any of the other topics I suggested in my last post?<br />

Right, I did have a reply all nearly finished, and then my stupid browser deleted it all for me (pressing &quot;delete&quot; twice in quick succession is the same as hitting the &quot;back&quot; button, and you don't seem to be able to stop it).

</div>It's not so much that I've taken it personally, it's just that it's counter-productive and childish.  You have accused me of having &quot;reverence&quot; for physics and physicists to such a degree as it affecting my reasoning in such a manner that I find it impossible to question either.  You have also, when I've attacked your application of a mathematical theory, you've accused me of attacking the theory, rather than your application of it.  What effect, other than possibly annoying me, did you think that these contradictory, inflamatory and dismissive statements could possibly have?  What constructive purpose did you think they would serve?<br />

And in your abilities of intellect (which establish your intelligence) I suppose you would agree that you exercise certain standards of intelligence over your DNA subsystem, right? In short, you use your intelligence to make calculated decisions of who you choose to procreate with. In fact, if you choose to NEVER procreate then this shows you, an intelligent being, have a supreme measure of power over your DNA, and whether your particular &quot;brew&quot; of DNA will get to &quot;live on&quot; in a new creation.

</div>While I agree that we have extremely limited creative power with regards to our DNA (in as much as we can (usually) choose who we have sex with and what, if any, contraception is used), we don't have the power of creation over it.  You cannot create your own DNA (well, you could make an argument for the generation of sperm being exactly that, but I see that as more of an automatic subsystem, as it's not a consious act.  Plus, it'd be leaving out the women, who are born with their lifetime's supply of eggs in situ).  What you <i>can</i> do is to attempt to fuse a random half of your DNA with a random half of the DNA of someone else (usually) of your choice.  But that's not the same thing as being able to replicate your own DNA at all.<br />

And, while we're on functional aspects, how about the largest, most over-riding functional aspect of DNA which hasn't been mentioned up until now?

No, I don't find it remotely scary.  I just think that it's wrong, on a fundamental level.  Think of it like this; I don't not believe in Santa Claus because I'm scared of what the world would be like if there was one, I simply don't think that the reasoning behind the existence of Santa holds up to scrutiny.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the ad hominem about anyone who is not agreeing with your thinking being &quot;adverse to helping humanity get a better grip on a definition of what may constitute 'divinity'&quot;, I think it's an admirable goal, and one that I do try to help people to achieve.  One that I think it's possible that I'm contributing to right now, in fact.  I just do not agree with your definition of what that understanding is.  That doesn't make me someone that you can legitimately look down upon, it just makes me someone that disagrees with your reasoning.  We can discuss it like adults, or you can score points off me.

If I conceed that it's not &quot;exceedingly unlikely&quot; (given the veracity of the above) that there is a higher intelligence, then will you conceed that it is also not &quot;exceedingly unlikely&quot; that there is <i>no</i> higher intelligence?<br />

It doesn't at all.  It's simply another theroy which doesn't seem to have much basis in fact.<br />

<br />
<br />
Hey fellow Travelers,<br />
<br />
<br />
I've really enjoyed readiing all the sides in the current debate/discussion about whether &quot;divinity&quot; has any validity at all in the &quot;systems of systems&quot; concept.  In a very real sense, you have yourselves created a system within a system; and we can, to some degree, examine this system and determine a concensus of view that is observable by all the individual elements.  In order to do so, each element would have to cede &quot;sovereignty&quot; to &quot;something&quot; in the center of all that would define the &quot;truth&quot; of the matter.  Whether we like to believe it or not, this is how science works.  Interestingly enough, this is also how &quot;religion&quot; is supposed to work as well.  Unfortunately, in both cases, one element gravitates to the center and corrupts and, consequently, disrupts the concentual view.  I've found this to be true working with adolescents, with groups of teachers as well as groups of religious &quot;experts&quot;.  When &quot;all&quot; can lay aside preconceived ideas and beliefs and see ourselves as &quot;elements&quot; in the system and not the only &quot;true&quot; element, then there is a possibility for true growth away from our &quot;linear&quot; lines of thinking toward dimensional understanding.  This goes for all elements of the system.  Unfortunately, there is always a strong period of &quot;dissonance&quot;.  When opposing waves interract, this is a natural occurrence and eventually it balances out.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've noticed a lot of dissonance in this thread, but I've also noticed a great deal of patience and willingness to go the extra mile--simply because you all CARE.  You care about lots of things, but mostly you care about the TRUTH.  Just as we all may not have the ability to tune a guitar, we can all tell when it is NOT in tune.  There is no doubt in my mind that if the &quot;proof&quot; could be shown, not only would the concept of divinity be wholeheartedly accepted--or rejected--you would all put your whole being into &quot;preaching&quot; it from that point on.  Some may have already reached that point but I always hold hope that &quot;place&quot; in the middle can be reached.  I think the Bible teaches this concept throughout its pages.  When you view it in this way, the contradictions turn into points of view--sometimes contrary to my own point of view.  Science is also very indicative of this.  There are several points of view.  The totality is &quot;something&quot; beyond all of us.  We are all limited to our understanding of that last infinitesmal moment following First Cause.  None of us can penetrate that veil.  I suspect that if the moment ever comes that we CAN penetrate the veil, science and divinity will be holding hands when it happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the basis of evidence alone, our universe is mechanistic and deterministic.  Yet in the words of a famous physicist, John Wheeler, (and I paraphrase)--despite the fact that we have discovered the &quot;differential equations&quot;, we still don't know why it &quot;flies&quot;.  Simply because of the discovery of &quot;non-local events&quot;, he changed his whole focus of study from the &quot;what&quot; to the &quot;why&quot;.  At 90-something years of age, he began to look beyond his own self-imposed paradigm.  Few other scientists who are &quot;in the know&quot; are willing to even discuss, let alone study, &quot;future science&quot;.  In this, they are no different than those in the past who have refused to accept &quot;advances&quot;.  Of course this does not imply that &quot;divinity&quot; will hold the keys to the answers.  However, there are few other directions to go in.  Like it or not, some scientists are considering &quot;god&quot; or, at least, something &quot;godlike&quot;.  Hats off to all of you.  Your observations really make me think.</div>

OK, it must be that I just offend you at every turn. Sorry! Really.  I'm from California, man. You know...the place everyone always makes fun of for us being &quot;out there&quot;?  Hell, we elected The Terminator to be our governor...you wanna talk evidence?  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />  Yes, I am a &quot;nut&quot;.  Yes, I am &quot;out there&quot;. We like to have lots of fun here in the sun, and not take things, especially philosophical debates all serious and [fecal matter]. I often use sarcasm (no, really?). I can OvErCaPiTaLiZe with the best of them. I have taken the name of the Lord in vain, I thought dirty thoughts about Ginger on Gilligans Island, and touched myself impurely during one of those thoughts!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big grin    :D" />   Yep...I definitely am a &quot;sinner&quot; and I am sorry if I offend you in my zeal to have a fun and lively debate.<br />
<br />
<br />
And on the flipside, I realize you are British (right?), so a bit more formalism is your way. I understand that, and that my style offends you.  So I will do my very best to be more stoic and to-the-point.  Less Hollywood...?  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

</div>OK, just as long as you realize that this view is in direct contrast to accepted systems theory of how systems integrate with one another across and within systemic boundaries.  In fact, power and influence is what systems integration is all about. Interfaces between systems (either at the same level or across levels of their nesting) are one of the two primary constructs that the systems engineer works with in development (the others are the Components).  Interfaces are the conduits for allowing systems to exert power and influence on other systems to achieve operational results.<br />

</div>No.  You are clearly not understanding the fractal definition of self-similar. I wish you'd do a little more research on these things you don't have a full grasp on, rather than relying on me to correct your understanding of them.  The words &quot;self-similar&quot; were chosen in fractal geometry for the precise reason that things do NOT have to be identical across systemic levels....and in point of fact, the scientists who developed these math noticed that embedded natural systems actually are NOT self-identical.  Are you aware of the geometric concept of similarity? Similar triangles are similar, but not identical.  This same concept is extended when it comes to fractal dimension and scaleability.  Wavelets is another good technology area for you to read up on to understand this concept. A single mother wavelet transform can generate self-similar (but not identical) wavelet tranforms at higher or lower levels of systemtic resolution. These mathematical tools, which grew out of fractals, have been shown to be MUCH more robust than the older techniques of Fourier transforms.<br />

The point was scaling, and resolution with respect to how a system and subsystem are related....especially from the point of observational horizons.  Scale and resolution variance are a central pillar of fractal geometry in terms of how boundaries are defined between one scale and another.<br />
How about you treat me with a little respect, and do some homework on the things I have been discussing?  Maybe learn about the mathematics of fractals and chaos a little more deeply so you don't make simple errors such as the one on self-similarity.  You're a lot less convincing to me when you try to debunk me on something you show little knowledge of.<br />

</div>Actually, I would put it down to my net upbringing, if you like.  The first message board I was ever a memeber of (and still am) was the snopes Urban Legends Reference Pages MB.  I don't know if you've ever heard of or even been there, but the level of debate is <i>very</i> high.  It's slacked off and gotten looser over the last two or three years, but it's still exceedingly bad form to attack the person behind the argument, rather than the argument itself.  There's a big difference between saying &quot;you aren't convinced by what I've said here about divinity, I think you've got a), b) and c) wrong in your reasoning&quot; and saying &quot;you aren't convinced by what I've said about divinity, it must be because you're too closed-minded and scared of thinking outside the box&quot;.

<br />
<br />
Besides, are we not discussing natural functions?  Because if we are counting scientific advances, wouldn't that mean that in some ways the evidence that you see of the parallells is true now, but wasn't 100 years ago.

</div>But you've had to either disregard or diminish what I would consider two out of three of the highest-ranked aspects.  First there's the genetic info telling us how to grow, then there's the self-replication and finally, there's the recombinance.  And I wouldn't really say that you can say that the last one is a similarity that we have anyway.  It does seem kind of arbitrary.<br />

			Correction: You cannot observe or identify a human equivalent function. Do you think our DNA is capable of observing/identifying the impact of their prime function on our bodies? Again, this is not a riddle. It has also been explained by systems theory in terms of how system embedding &quot;hides&quot; entire layers of information context. I think the premise is based on one of Boehm's theorems. You cannot definitively say the human species does not have a coherent function to a higher-level system.

</div>Well, okay.  But, once more, I see absolutely no evidence <i>for</i> it.  I mean, this can seem like a persuasive argument, but it's not really.  True, I cannot disprove this theory of yours.  But I also cannot disprove the existence of the Judeo-Christian God, or the Roman Gods, or Santa Clause, or Hubert The Invisible Purple Dancing Beaver Deity, or my mad scientist from a 50s B-movie poking electrodes into my brain to create all of this.<br />
<br />
<br />
That I cannot disprove this doesn't make it being true more likely.  All it means is that I have to use more qualifiers when talking about it, as I cannot say with 100% certainty that it's not true.  Not if I want to be scrupulously accurate, in any case.<br />

</div>Okay, &quot;proof&quot; was a little too hard a term.  But what the example you offered doesn't do is stregnthen your case in the slightest.  Yes, maybe we have roughly or even exactly the same difference in size.  I can't rule it out as a possibility.  But, without being able to measure the universe, I can't think of it as anythign other than a remote possibility.  And, again, it's you choosing the criteria.  If the scale weren't exactly the same, how close would it have to be to be considered valid?  An order of 2?  10? 100? 1000?  What margin of error is there in measuring?  What average size of human do we take? And so on.  That's all up to you.<br />

Unless it were <i>exactly</i> the same, it wouldn't prove anything.  And even if it were exactly the same, then that still leaves the possibility of coincidence.<br />

			How about you treat me with a little respect, and do some homework on the things I have been discussing? Maybe learn about the mathematics of fractals and chaos a little more deeply so you don't make simple errors such as the one on self-similarity. You're a lot less convincing to me when you try to debunk me on something you show little knowledge of.

</div>Well, with all due respect, if there's a concept that you're relying on to be part of your reasoning, then shouldn't you explain it?  You can't very well use the technical aspects of your vocation to explain things and then act offended when I'm not as much of an expert in the subject as you are.  When I had a point to make using semiology, I explained the relevent aspects in detail.  If there's something that you think I ought to know that you think I don't before I can fully understand what you're saying, then why not explain it, or link to a page that does?<br />
<br />
<br />
Because, as it is, you're saying that I shouldn't converse with you until I know certain as-yet unspecified things about subjects that you pluck out of the air with gay abandon. That's hardly fair, is it?</div>

</div>I did not contradict myself, but I was afraid you were going to say that. What I was trying to say is that there is only one way to interpret &quot;divine&quot;, which makes it &quot;not open to interpretation&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not an absolutist. Like I said, I usually start any discussion with &quot;My personal opinion is...&quot; or something similar. But this time I'm sure of my case.<br />

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</div>That's not true. You tried to take the edge off my statement by throwing in the verb. All I did was show you the existing relationship between the verb, the adjective and the noun. They're all linked to god, godlike, supreme being, etc. No doubt about that!<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I'm not very good at technical science. So please feel free to educate me in that field  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

Of course I know that this is only an example, but please don't tell me that it's a total coincidence that they're using this specific example.

	</div>
</div>I can only tell you that I think the evidence provided to date is far from sufficient. I find it difficult to define the standard of evidence I require, since the theory of a (conscious) creator does not appeal to me at all. The &quot;evidence that is the universe&quot; as you beautifully stated, is definitely not evidence of the existence of a (conscious) creator. I can probably come up with a million other theories and claim &quot;the universe around us&quot; as my evidence.<br />

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Also not true. In fact I was hoping you could provide me with new insights and theories of what you think this higher-level state of being actually is, but instead you're clinging to &quot;the divine&quot; and a creator. This is certainly not the revolutionary thinking I was hoping for. To me it seems as if you can't let go entirely of the classic views of the religion you were raised up with.<br />

	</div>
</div>Before I go on I want to add that I think there's a substantial difference between our ability to create and the &quot;creation&quot; that takes place on a systemic level. We create things using our minds. It requires creativity. I don't see the same creativity when it comes to this &quot;higher level system&quot;. For one thing, you claim that it has creative powers, yet it doesn't create anymore. And if it does, what does it create?

</div>You compare our relation to the higher-level system with the relationship of DNA to us. This would imply that our DNA is also self-aware or conscious. Would you care to explain how you see that. I think we have the ability to be self-aware because we have the ability to think. Does DNA have this ability? I don't think so.<br />

</div>I enjoy debating with you as well. I do think my logic is just as good as yours. You obviously have an advantage when it comes to science.

I do think you're more knowledegeable, especially in the field of science, but sometimes you can be quite stubborn.

			In which case, I would say that other than the societies in which we live (and by that I mean the many different interrelated sets, such as the global society, and out family units, and our country's societies, and every set and subset besides), no there is no higher-level system. If it has to have some level of control over us for it to be defined as such then, no, I don't believe it can be defined as such.

</div>Please clarify what you are saying here, because it is not clear. I am telling you an empirical fact of how systems relate to each other and influence each other via relationships.  This is another example of where I provide evidence from a body of accepted knowledge (not just my opinion), and you give a vague answer.  What do you mean by &quot;I don't believe it can be defined as such&quot;?  Who was talking about a definition, and what is &quot;it&quot;?  You see, the fact that you are otherwise a clear communicator leads me to believe you are avoiding, or otherwise ignoring, the accepted evidence I have provided.  Very similar to your skirting the issues of fractal dimension.  Your level of clarity observably declines when I present evidence that you do not wish to admit supports my position.  That is a tactic most often used by people not interested in a true debate, where we learn, but in simply getting a kick out of trying to debunk anything someone says.  This is the impression you give by changing your level of clarity like this.<br />
In a relativistic universe (and I hope you are not going to debunk Einstein), all systems are related to, and influence, all others through interfaces and influences that take on various forms of energy. Example: The higher level system of our sun and the other planets in our solar system have influence (and therefore an element of control) over our earth subsystem.  So in reading your vague reply, and putting it into the context of the accepted facts of systems engineering I provided you, about all I can infer from your answer is that you think there is no system outside the boundaries of our universe (whatever they would be). Because you see, if there IS a higher-level context system outside the boundaries of our universe, then that system, by its very existence, has influence and interaction with our universe.  So please clarify exactly what you mean by the above.<br />

</div>More vagueness....so, just what IS &quot;in real terms&quot;?  And how about &quot;all that much closer&quot;?  Because I would cite that 100 years ago, we did not even know which regions of the brain were responsible for what functions.  And in order to assess what you mean by &quot;understanding&quot; the brain, we would need to know a precise definition for what constitutes understanding.  No, you are much too vague here for this to be acceptable. I think most neuroscientists would say we have come quite far in the last 100 years with regard to understanding the brain.  But this doesn't mean we still don't have far to go.<br />

			Because if we are counting scientific advances, wouldn't that mean that in some ways the evidence that you see of the parallells is true now, but wasn't 100 years ago. So doesn't that actually mean that the existence of a divine entity is more likely now than it was back then?
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>Scientific advances are part-and-parcel of our nature, are they not?  And I was not aware that &quot;evidence&quot; required observation or discovery by humans for it to BE evidence.  The evidence for a meteor strike being the potential reason for dinosaur extinction was there in the geological record all along.  Are you telling me that this evidence was not &quot;true&quot; until we actually found that evidence?<br />
So yes, I am talking about natural functions, which includes anything in the universe AND the functions it performs.  Our human drive to understand and discover is natural, and therefore any evidence that we discover does not make the existence of a divine entity any more or less likely.  What it DOES do is inrease the liklihood that we can prove this entity's existence, at some arbitrary standard of evidence.<br />

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>And why, pray tell, do you claim this?  I've got a good idea what a couple of your arguments are likely to be, so let me address those:  (1) Please don't use the claim that DNA creates identical replicas of itself. First because there are mutations, but more importantly, I have already addressed embedding with respect to fractal self-similarity, which does not require self-identicality.  Human beings self-replicate, and they do create self-similar infants.  (2) Now you just may point out the difference between asexual replication of DNA and sexual replication of humans.  To this I would ask: Have you ever considered that the double helix of DNA is &quot;self-similar&quot; to a human male/female couple?  In fact, they are also self-similar in the fact that Purines will only bond with Pyrimadines, just as a man can only create a life with a woman.  So yes, both humans and DNA create self-similar replicas.<br />

		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>No, it does not.  You are again getting confused between the existence of a higher being stated by the theory, and the revelation of evidence that supports the veracity of the theory.  Another example: Einstein's theory of relativity has undergone many tests and, so far, each one has provided more evidence of its truth.  We have recently launched Gravity Probe B to verify Einstein's conclusions about &quot;frame drag&quot;.  If the results come back and support Einstein's theory, this does not change the fact that the theory is correct... it only provides more evidence of its correctness.  Similar with evidence resulting in &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; to throw out a court conviction.  More evidence does not change the fact that the crime was committed.  It only provides a greater level of certainty that the accused was the one who committed the crime.<br />

</div>No. Please get a grip on self-similarity. Go study advances in fractals, as I have asked you to do before.  If you are truly interested in learning from this debate, and not just getting jollies out of attempted debunking, then you should want to investigate bodies of knowledge that I use to support my statements...all by yourself.  I get paid for teaching things in detail, so I don't feel like giving you free lessons.<br />

</div>Well, I can say it, and it is supportable.  For I think you already know that the reproductive gametes of the male and female are haploid cells, and that this is the mechanism of human recombination.  Self-similar indeed to the unzipping of the double helix during meiosis.<br />

</div>And here again I see you have ignored points I have made before...so I shall repeat them:  (1) I am following a process of induction, which does not require direct evidence for the general truth at hand. It only requires direct evidence of the particular cases in the inductive argument. (2) Until you define a standard of acceptable evidence, you can always claim you don't see evidence for it, by simply raising the unstated bar of what constitutes acceptable evidence. And now to add to these points, let's look at another example: Do you SEE any evidence whatsoever that there may be other intelligent species in our galaxy or universe?  I assume you will say no.  So then I'd ask if you are familiar with the Drake Equation?  This is a bit of inductive reasoning based on fairly well estbalished individual probabilities.  And it is also accepted by those in the SETI and other astronomical communities.  And in fact, Drake's quantification of this equation has essentially showed us just how ridiculous (unlikely) it would be to assume we are the only intelligent species in this universe.<br />

</div>More accurate than the Christian standard bibles (e.g. King James Version, etc.)  There is a translation of Genesis 1 in the book  <b>Sepher Yetzirah</b> that is much more true to the original Hebrew text.

I don't believe I ever insulted you in such a direct manner as calling you gay.  Rather, in this particular case, I made a sarcastic statement wondering if you were really interested in exploring the possibilities of a higher-level intelligence.  You simply inferred the insult that was never intended.  That is so far from the kind of crap that Chrono spews that now *I* choose to infer an insult.

I know that you are smart enough to take the basic concepts I have described, and either google to get more, or head to the library.

You should also note on this page that it gives an inkling about what the multiple resolution criteria is for your question above about &quot;how close would it have to be to be considered valid&quot;.  It is NOT an arbitrary choice as you imply. But rather dependent upon another concept I have brought up in past discussions which, apparantly, you chose to ignore: the Golden Mean Ratio and Fibonacci sequence.  If my off-the-cuff observation of DNA/human and human/universe were computed, and both of these reflected (approximately) the Golden Mean Ratio, this *would* be a strong bit of evidence for statistical significance of their being highly self-similar.<br />

Oh yes... here is a good summary quote from  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/5833/cycas.html" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">this site</a> which also discusses relationships between self-similarity and GMS/Fibonacci:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Selfsimilar growth, ubiquitous to nature (living and nonliving), is therefore governed by universal dynamical laws which are independent of the exact details (chemical, physical, physiological, electrical etc.) of the dynamical system, i.e., a system which evolves with time.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This (hopefully) further clarifies the point that DNA mechanisms do not have to be  <i>identical</i> in any manner for them to be self-similar.  The distinguishing critera is a scaling relationship to the golden mean ratio.<br />

Hello Zerub!<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice, balanced post.  I agree with what you say.<br />

	</div>
</div>A very good point.  Creation is a process that never ceases. All systems are dynamic, even if we humans perceive certain systems (e.g. mountains) as if they appear static.  Reference timeframes and frequency bands are highly dependent upon the physical structure of the system, and any other systems observing it.<br />

ALL points of view are equally valid, and can be compared, provided one invokes the appropriate transformations from one coordinate system (POV) to the other.  In fact, this scientific fact is part of my motivation to help some folks understand &quot;alternate&quot; views of God and/or a diety.  Specifically, if we put aside any biases we have from hearing &quot;dictatorial&quot; religious zealots and organizations tell us how we should think of God, we can explore alternate points of view with respect to what we might mean by &quot;God&quot;.  This is where I am going with the examining the links between the universal concept of continusous creation, and a potential higher-level intelligence....call it what you may!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /> <br />

</div>Yes, I really admire Wheeler for this very reason.  He has the true, open mind of a real pioneer.  It just seems to be a simple cop-out to rely on &quot;coincidence&quot; or &quot;that's just the way it is&quot; as a means to avoid investigating the answer to WHY something is the way it is.<br />

</div>That's what I mean.  Yes, we know more about the brain than we did 100 years ago.  We know which areas of the brain tend to be used during various mental activities.  And that's pretty much it.  You were talking about having mapped the human genome meaning that we'll be able to control it soon.  I don't believe it's that simple, in just the same way as knoowing what the frontal lobes are for hasn't helped us much in tersm of controlling people's brainwaves.  We can see what people's brains look like when they're watching TV, but we cannot make people think that they are watching TV when they're not.  Similarly, we may know what gene controls eye colour (and I think it would be a gross oversimplification to say that there was just the one), but that's not the same thing as being able to make a baby with a specific shade and pattern in their eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, no, I don't think that we have, or will have soon, substansive control over our own DNA.<br />

			Scientific advances are part-and-parcel of our nature, are they not? And I was not aware that &quot;evidence&quot; required observation or discovery by humans for it to BE evidence.

</div>I think you're taking this out of context somewhat.  You were giving, as part of your evidence for the existence of a higher level of intelligence than ourselves, the example of the fact that we have mapped the human genome and that that gave us control over our DNA.  You were saying that the fact that we could control our DNA in this fashion was another example of how we have things in common.  So, does it not follow that before we could do this, that we <i>didn't</i> have this thing in common?

</div>We do not self-replicate.  You can argue about the definition of &quot;similar&quot;, but &quot;self-replicate&quot; has a specific meaning, and we do not create exact copies of ourselves by ourselves.

</div>No, not really.  For you, maybe, proving that there is a relationship between humans and DNA in terms of intelligence is enough evidence for you to believe that there is a higher intelligence, but it doesn't indicate that to me at all.  If we assume that I am agreeing with absolutely everything that you are saying and have said about humans and DNA...that still isn't indicative to me of there being a higher intelligence.<br />
<br />
<br />
As I've said before, if it were, then the existence of that higher intelligence would necessarily be indicative of an even higher intelligence beyond that.  And <i>that</i> intelligence would be indicative of another beyond that.  And so on for eternity.  And exactly the same logic would indicate that there's a system lower than DNA.  And one lower than that.  And aother lower than that.  Again, off to infinity.<br />
<br />
<br />
This seems, to me, to be counter-intuitive, rather than something that follows on logically.<br />

</div>How do you expect me to define a standard of evidence that I would find acceptable?  About 73% reliability would do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
All I can do is to assess the evidence that I am confronted with on it's individual merits as I see them.  If you really feel that I'm playing some childish game where all I intend to do is automatically gainsay whatever you put in front of me, then there's not much that I can do to change that rather unkind opinion of me.  All I can say is that that's not what I'm doing, and if you show me some evidence that I find convincing, then I'll happily say &quot;yes, I find that convincing&quot;.  Just because I'm not convinced by the evidence you've presented so far doesn't mean that I am incapable of being convinved by evidence, it just means that you've not managed to do that yet.  If you don't believe me, then what can I do?<br />

What standard of evidence that I'm not some juvenile numpty who's got it in for you will it take for you to believe?<br />

</div>The equation itself shows us nothing of the kind.  The numbers that people plug into it would be what is indicative of how likely contact with alien life is.  As for what those numbers <i>are</i>, well that's a hotly debated issuse, as there's a lot of conjecture involved with every single one of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did Drake do his own quantification of the equation?  The quote of his to be found http://staff.imsa.edu/science/astrophys/studentwork/mooboy/drake.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here says differently:<br />

			The importance of the Drake Equation is not in the<br />
<br />
<br />
 solving, but rather in the contemplation. It was written<br />
<br />
<br />
 not for purposes of quantification at all, but rather as<br />
<br />
<br />
 the agenda for the world's first SETI meeting, in Green<br />
<br />
<br />
 Bank WV in 1961. It was quite useful for its intended<br />
<br />
<br />
 application, which was to summarize all the various<br />
<br />
<br />
 factors which scientists must contemplate when<br />
<br />
<br />
 considering the question of other life. It is interesting<br />
<br />
<br />
 that when the Equation was first written, the only factor<br />
<br />
<br />
 which we had any basis to estimate with reasonable<br />
<br />
<br />
 accuracy was the first, the rate of stellar formation. In<br />
<br />
<br />
 the four decades since, we have learned something<br />
<br />
<br />
 about extra-solar planets, so we can now estimate the<br />
<br />
<br />
 second factor. We also have direct evidence as to the<br />
<br />
<br />
 existence of two planets in their star's habitable zones,<br />
<br />
<br />
 so (though the sample size is small) we can roughly<br />
<br />
<br />
 estimate the third factor. At this rate, we should have<br />
<br />
<br />
 three more factors nailed down by the middle of the<br />
<br />
<br />
 next century! A value for the seventh will probably<br />
<br />
<br />
 always elude us.

</div>For the record, I would be surprised if this planet were the only one in the universe that has life-forms on it.  But in no way is the Drake equation <i>evidence</i> that life exists on other planets.<br />

			So now it is my turn to expect an apology from you in the next post. Comparing me to that idiot is about as insulting as you can get. I don't believe I ever insulted you in such a direct manner as calling you gay. Rather, in this particular case, I made a sarcastic statement wondering if you were really interested in exploring the possibilities of a higher-level intelligence. You simply inferred the insult that was never intended. That is so far from the kind of crap that Chrono spews that now *I* choose to infer an insult. I thought that you would at least give me more credit than that idiot because I can speak in coherent, complete, correct English sentences.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</div>I give you more credit than Chrono, sure.  A lot more.  However, the fact remains that you acted in the same way as he did when I said that I found something that you had said to not be polite.  You turned round and said &quot;well, it was just a joke.  Sorry that you don't have a sense of humour&quot;.  Not only is that the most back-handed apology possible, but it is a method to deflect blame from yourself back onto the person that you acted insultingly towards in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll happily apologise for any hurt feelings on your part, but I am not going to apologise for saying that you behaved in the same manner as Chronohistorian in that one, specific instance.  Because it is true.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll reiterate; saying &quot;I was only joking&quot; is absolutely no defence against someone saying that they found something that you have said insulting.  It is the worst possible excuse.<br />

Especially considering that you, here, have very nicely managed to avoid the question that I asked you (isn't that what you have accused me of?).  I didn't say that it would have to be exactly the same at all.  I asked you how close it would have to be for you to consider it valid.<br />

			You should also note on this page that it gives an inkling about what the multiple resolution criteria is for your question above about &quot;how close would it have to be to be considered valid&quot;. It is NOT an arbitrary choice as you imply. But rather dependent upon another concept I have brought up in past discussions which, apparantly, you chose to ignore: the Golden Mean Ratio and Fibonacci sequence.

			If my off-the-cuff observation of DNA/human and human/universe were computed, and both of these reflected (approximately) the Golden Mean Ratio, this *would* be a strong bit of evidence for statistical significance of their being highly self-similar.

		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</div>&quot;Self-similar&quot; does not equal &quot;necessarily related&quot;, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
The ratio of the distance of the Sun from the Earth and it's size is the same as the same ratio for the moon.  But they're not related.  There is no causal relationship between them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or, a different example I've always liked - in Norway (I think it was) one year there was a 20% increase in the stork population one summer.  That summer there was also a 20% increase in the birth rate. The two do not have a causal relationship, though.  They are not related to each other.<br />

			How do you expect me to define a standard of evidence that I would find acceptable? About 73% reliability would do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
All I can do is to assess the evidence that I am confronted with on it's individual merits as I see them. If you really feel that I'm playing some childish game where all I intend to do is automatically gainsay whatever you put in front of me, then there's not much that I can do to change that rather unkind opinion of me. All I can say is that that's not what I'm doing, and if you show me some evidence that I find convincing, then I'll happily say &quot;yes, I find that convincing&quot;. Just because I'm not convinced by the evidence you've presented so far doesn't mean that I am incapable of being convinved by evidence, it just means that you've not managed to do that yet. If you don't believe me, then what can I do?<br />
<br />
<br />
What standard of evidence that I'm not some juvenile numpty who's got it in for you will it take for you to believe?

<br />
<br />
I don't know if you were referring to me as the absolutist or not, but this looks like a good place to jump in on this thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
I always find it somewhat selfish of those that claim that God doesn't exist.  You exist, so why should'nt God also exist?<br />
<br />
<br />
As  far as doubting one's own existence, stepping in front of a speeding truck will resolve any of those doubts.  As far as what God does or doesn't do, God is God and can do as He/She wishes without any body saying otherwise.  If He/She so decided that man was tiresome and stupid, we all could be eliminated in a blink of the celestial eye.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was in a chat room the other day and when I saw the pictures of the atheist's I could see why they didnt believe in a God, since they seemed to be absent when good looks were being issued.  Most that dont believe actually have some sort of grudge against God, an inner anger/dissatisfaction that causes a separation in any possible relationship with a supreme being.<br />
<br />
<br />
For those that also deny His/Her existence, I do see how it is possible for such a being to come to pass.  Somehwere else in this vast Universe there is life, not just here on Earth.  If that other species had a more complete or perfected DNA system and became capable of expanding their mental awareness to the point of actually being able to manipulate energy fields, they may have been successful of becoming independent of the need of physical sustinence, just drawing energy from other sources. (raw energy)<br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone was successful at this and became capable of re-newing themselves at will, they essentially would become eternal in thier existence.  After a few million years I imagine their skills at manipulation of particules would be immense, and creation of physical bodies would not be beyond the scope of their abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
If one was knowledgeable on the basics of life, and could start the process, evolution would take over after the first seeds were planted. The creator only would need to &quot;tend the garden&quot; as required to make sure it survived. Since this lifeform is adept at manipulating energy and after eons of practice, could perform the feats as written in many religious texts.<br />
<br />
<br />
It may also be the intention of said creator to remain hidden, for absolute proof would cause many to committ suicide to escape thier life on Earth.  At least if there is  doubt as to a supreme being's existence, then as a species we continue to stay involved in the game, uncertain if we will survive death or not.</div>

</div>Well, I've been told I'm a handsome man on more than one occasion.  Certainly, I think I'm attractive enough to not make me resentful of anyone or anything because of the way I look.<br />
<br />
<br />
Funnily enough, the stereotype of the Christian (apart from the 16 year-old female type so beloved of a certain kind of pervert) is that they are ugly.  But, of course, generalisations and stereotypes are just that.<br />
<br />

</div>Again, this is only speaking in a very generalised way, but I think that, in this case, you're broadly right.  Rest assured, however, when I tell you that certainly as far as I'm concerened, I have no ill-will towards any potential creator or much in the way of internalised anger directed at anything at all, in fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, that said, I think that if I were convinced of the existence of the Judeo-Christian God, I'd want to sit him down and there are things I'd be looking for him to explain himself on (particularly if everything in the Bible is true).  However, I really, <i>really</i> don't believe in Him (or any variation of Him) any more than I do Hubert.  I direct no anger towards Him for the same reason that I don't direct anger towards Batman.</div>

</div>With all due respect OvrLrdLegion, but that is one of the worst examples of reasoning I've ever witnessed in my entire life. How is it selfish? People who believe in god claim that he exists all the time. In fact, people here in Holland try to force their believes upon me on a regular basis. When I'm at home, when I'm traveling to work, when I'm coming out of the cinema. I find that very impolite and annoying. So please think twice before calling me selfish.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for your reasoning:<br />
<br />
<br />
I exist, so why shouldn't Santa Claus exist?<br />
<br />
<br />
I exist, so why shouldn't the Tooth Fairy exist?<br />

</div>That's nonsense. I don't believe in God, so I can't possibly have a grudge against him. In the <b>hypothetical</b> scenario where god does exist, I would only be very dissapointed in him. I'm perfectly happy without god or any other supreme being in my life.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yes, you are both right.  I didnt follow the selfish idea through...it was rather selfish of me to say it..And I apologize for the appearance statement also, since both remarks have absolutlely no basis in fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, when involved lengthy discussion with most Atheists, I usually discover a reason that is based on some type of let-down or dissappointment resulting in the non-belief of a creator, this statement  is based on past discussions and may not be valid in all situations with all people.<br />
<br />
<br />
As humans we do have the ability to bury anger and pain deep within ourselves, hidden from our awareness, causing reactions to situations or ideals automatically.<br />
<br />
<br />
I.E....my daughter used to have this boyfriend that I despised, hated, and I loathed every fiber of his being.  He is long gone, however, my current supervisor has many attributes similar to this scum bag. I react with intense rage to this supervisor at times, unwarranted I admit, this rage is my automatic reaction because I have images and emotions evolving around the boyfriend.  My mind is making some kind of connection and calling the two, one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aside from my comments regarding the Atheists appearrance, the meat of the post was regarding the possibilites of the existence of a supreme being.  An advanced being that has existed for eons that has developed skills during his/her time would become such a being.<br />
<br />
<br />
We also reflect the same ability, not as advanced, for creation.  I plant seeds in my garden and tend to it as a father to children. ( Excepting the cactus plants, I can even forget to water em for a long time and they survive )  I can imagine a supreme being locating this world and planting the seeds for life.  How He/She tends the garden..well..maybe we are the cactus plants.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most people that try to find God in textual form will be dissappointed.  God is an experience, interpretation a result of the life lived and what has been learned so far by the individual.<br />
<br />
<br />
God has no limitations or boundaries, so can fit into any definition by man, but God as a whole is<br />
<br />
<br />
beyond Man's comprehension.<br />
<br />
<br />
He is not the collection of other beings, nor the abstraction of existence, nor a philosophically definable being.  He is in all, distint from all, and greater than all.  His very name is ineffable; and yet this name only expresses the human ideal of His Divintiy.  What God is in Himself is not given to man to know.  God is the absolute of faith; existence is the absolute of reason, existence exists by itself, and because it exists.  The reason of the existence of existence is existence itself. We may ask, &quot;Why does any particular thing exist?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
To say&quot;I will believe when  the truth of the dogma shall be scientifically proved to me&quot; is the same as to say, &quot;I will believe when when I have nothing more to believe, and when the dogma shall be destroyed as dogma by becoming scientific theorem.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That is to say, in other words: &quot; I will only admit the Infinite when it shall have been explained, determined, circumscribed, and defined for my benefit; in one word, when it has become &quot;finite.&quot;  I will then believe in the Infinite when I am sure that the Infinite does not exist.  I will believe in the vastness of the ocean when I shall have seen it put into bottles.&quot;  But when a thing has been clearly proven and made comprehensible to you, you will longer &quot;believe&quot; it, you will &quot;know&quot; it.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, the original texts never used the word believe, only the word faith.  God didnt ask for you to &quot;believe&quot; He exists...only to have faith..</div>

I can't proove that such a being doesn't exist just as good as you can't proof it does. You choose to believe in something, for which there is no physical evidence. I choose not to believe. It's an endless discussion, which I can continue for days, weeks, months or even years... it never bores me, but usually nothing good comes out of it. For once I'd like to hear some new arguments why I should believe there's a creator.<br />

As Far as proof of other forces,  I urge you to participate in a ritual with an adept of the Arts.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am sure you can find at least one in Holland.  The experience could be enlightening to say the least.  No arguments will be required, experience will be the mentor.</div>
