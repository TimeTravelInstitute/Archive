&quot;There is no such thing, at this date of the world's history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. <br />
&quot;I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? <br />
<br />
&quot;We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. <br />

&quot;We are intellectual prostitutes.&quot;</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>RE: REPTILIAN PARALLEL WORLDS</b><br />
<br />
What can I say...I knew the truth for a long time, but always thought I was alone in knowing it.<br />
How was I supposed to know that others knew the samethings...&amp; we all received it from the same source?<br />
The history behind how I learned these things, and how others learned them as well, seems almost trivial and too tedious to put to task my writing skills and memory. So just let it be said coincidences are more than just carefully timed 'arrangements'.<br />
All the acid trips and meditations, all the mental aerobics of weight lifting, bodybuilding and martial arts, all the Tai Chi and Yoga,,, all of it, worked it's way into my etheric streams... But that last hit of DMT &amp; the final unforgiving Kundalini surge eventually broke through the last defense mechanism of a tired mind.<br />
I started putting it together from the phone calls I would receive right after certain rituals. The Enochian rites always brought black helicopters circling over my property. At times, I felt a consuming E.L.F. wave eating at my solar plexus. Certainly, some of the lesser effects were undoubtly from the intensity of my magick, but there were some effects I knew were from external  sources.<br />
My inner circle of friends consisted of mainly magi and psychics. All of them sensed the white noise that was relentless inside my head. They figured I pushed the proverbial envelope one too many times...but even they weren't ready for what was about to face all of us.<br />
The morning edition of the small town newspaper carried a small report on the third page that a multi-colored object, triangular shaped object, buzzed over the mountain range about a block from my home. There was also a small explosion, but there wasn't any evidence of a collison. Coincidentially, a small rock fell from the sky as well, and that was the impact we all heard and felt. Unlikely I thought...<br />
Perhaps there wasn't any evidence because the remains were scooped up by all them black helicopters that woke me up that morning.  <br />
Maybe I should have a better look.<br />
I took off to the charred remains of clearing in the woods where the object fell, and true...the site was cleared, no remains, just what looked like a brush fire that got out of hand. Oh well, hell, was just one of them things I suppose.<br />
Later on that afternoon, a knock at my door brought me face to face with 3 men all wearing expensive suits. I don't know anybody that wear suits, as I could sense they were some sort of 'official big shots' Heh, I was correct this time. &quot;Could we have a word with you, Mr. __ __&quot;<br />
Huh,,,they even knew my name.<br />
&quot;Nope I said, I'm busy&quot; as I closed the door. I could of sworn I heard one of them mumble &quot;We'll be seeing ya soon&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah right&quot; I thought...but somewhere in my subconscious, I knew he was right...<br />
Well, he was right. Later that night, I heard some raccoons eating through my trash barrel. Going ouside to clean it up, I was in close proximity to those 'officials&quot;, though there were only 2 of them now.<br />
So, I figured, if I didn't talk to these dudes, they would always be around my property, so what the hell... &quot;what's up?&quot; I casually snickered.<br />
I don't remember much after that. I lost track of one of the guys as I was speaking  to the other. I woke up by my back porch, smelling ammonia or something similair to that odor.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
2<br />
I had a wicked headache, and later on during that early morning I felt like I had the flu bug.<br />
To shorten up this story...two years later, I still get those very same headaches, and can smell in the distance, that very same odor...<br />
I and a friend of my choice, went to work for them. 'They' were in a branch of the military, but I never really knew to what extent.<br />
It was a substantial pay I received, and did some very interesting things. Mostly remote viewing under psychedelic drugs. Wasn't any drugs I have ever used in my personal studies. This was intravenous, and was VERY strong.<br />
Most of it was training on my part, until the final two weeks of this 'black project'. I once called it that, a &quot;Black Project&quot;, when I was under trance, but a hand grabbed my arm, and 'reassured' me, it wasn't a black project...just something they wanted to confirm by a neutral team...being me and my friend.<br />
Maybe I just wanted to feel important, was the reason I felt this way, was 'their advice'...<br />
Those last 2 weeks were very intense.<br />
Seemed like a lucid dream, very surreal. I was put in an amber foam, giving intravenous, then went under a blue light.<br />
I remember most of it in dreams, though when I get hypnotically regressed, it seems to be locked up...there's a subliminal barrier I just can't quite overcome, even until this very day. But man, do I still try to break through past that threshold.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
3<br />
The pieces  I can recall is what follows...<br />
When the dinosaurs lived, man did as well. We weren't &quot;man&quot; as in homo sapiens, but we were in some other form. I can not recall this form, because I was like in a third party, viewing it from a distance. There were lights, bright orbs. Somewhere from far away, we became 'created'. Well, this isn't so spectacular, as I believed this anyway. However, what follows is where the curve comes in...<br />
There followed afterwards, an ice age. It seemed planned, as man entered a new dimension. It appears as if the ice age was a laboratory setting. I seen huge metallic cylinders, and &quot;they&quot; told me what I saw was overlapping of time-lines from my own perspective...bogus, I thought. This is what I pieced together from the intense experiments...--<br />
Man became a cryogenic experiment, and right now, we are all in a dream state. Some are catching glimpses of the former reality, while others are grabbing bits and pieces of the future. There are many of them... Man has lived in this suspended dream time for millions of years, and our handlers are keeping us from never awakening. We are laboratory specimens being maintained somewhere, far from anything we know. We are NOT living on the Earth, we are only experiencing the Earth as a platform setting for our cosmic dream. It is 'fabricated landscape'. NOTHING is how it appears. The stage is fictious, but we have become accustomed to this stage for so long,,,many of us simply will NOT wake up.<br />
The most ironic part is this. When one of us do awaken momentarily, we try to stir our slumbering neighbor,,,but they choose not to hear. During the interim, waiting for some type of confirmation, we fall back asleep. This is why when we get close to truth, we enter another alternate reality. Our next 'new' dream just super imposes over the old dream, and the faces and scenery change, but nevertheless, we are still,... just dreaming.<br />

     Abstract - In July 1995 the CIA declassified, and approved for release,<br />
documents revealing its sponsorship in the<br />
     1970s of a program at Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, CA, to<br />
determine whether such phenomena as<br />
     remote viewing &quot;might have any utility for intelligence collection&quot;<br />
&lt;1&gt;. Thus began disclosure to the public of a<br />
     two-decade-plus involvement of the intelligence community in the<br />
investigation of so-called parapsychological or psi<br />
     phenomena. Presented here by the program's Founder and first Director<br />
(1972 - 1985) is the early history of the<br />
     program, including discussion of some of the first, now declassified,<br />
results that drove early interest. <br />
       <br />
<br />
Introduction<br />
<br />
On April 17, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order Nr. 1995-4-17,<br />
entitled Classified National Security<br />
Information. Although in one sense the order simply reaffirmed much of what<br />
has been long-standing policy, in another sense<br />
there was a clear shift toward more openness. In the opening paragraph, for<br />
example, we read: &quot;In recent years, however,<br />
dramatic changes have altered, although not eliminated, the national<br />
security threats that we confront. These changes provide<br />
a greater opportunity to emphasize our commitment to open Government.&quot; In<br />
the Classification Standards section of the<br />
Order this commitment is operationalized by phrases such as &quot;If there is<br />
significant doubt about the need to classify<br />
information, it shall not be classified.&quot; Later in the document, in<br />
reference to information that requires continued protection,<br />
there even appears the remarkable phrase &quot;In some exceptional cases,<br />
however, the need to protect such information may be<br />
outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in<br />
these cases the information should be declassified.&quot;<br />
<br />
A major fallout of this reframing of attitude toward classification is that<br />
there is enormous pressure on those charged with<br />
maintaining security to work hard at being responsive to reasonable requests<br />
for disclosure. One of the results is that FOIA<br />
(Freedom of Information Act) requests that have languished for months to<br />
years are suddenly being acted upon.1 <br />
<br />
One outcome of this change in policy is the government's recent admission of<br />
its two-decade-plus involvement in funding<br />
highly-classified, special access programs in remote viewing (RV) and<br />
related psi phenomena, first at Stanford Research<br />
Institute (SRI) and then at Science Applications International Corporation<br />
(SAIC), both in Menlo Park, CA, supplemented<br />
by various in-house government programs. Although almost all of the<br />
documentation remains yet classified, in July 1995 270<br />
pages of SRI reports were declassified and released by the CIA, the<br />
program's first sponsor &lt;2&gt;. Thus, although through the<br />
years columns by Jack Anderson and others had claimed leaks of &quot;psychic spy&quot;<br />
programs with such exotic names as Grill<br />
Flame, Center Lane, Sunstreak and Star Gate, CIA's release of the SRI<br />
reports constitutes the first documented public<br />
admission of significant intelligence community involvement in the psi area.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a consequence of the above, although I had founded the program in early<br />
1972, and had acted as its Director until I left in<br />
1985 to head up the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin (at which point<br />
my colleague Ed May assumed responsibility as<br />
Director), it was not until 1995 that I found myself for the first time able<br />
to utter in a single sentence the connected acronyms<br />
CIA/SRI/RV. In this report I discuss the genesis of the program, report on<br />
some of the early, now declassified, results that<br />
drove early interest, and outline the general direction the program took as<br />
it expanded into a multi-year, multi-site,<br />
multi-million-dollar effort to determine whether such phenomena as remote<br />
viewing &quot;might have any utility for intelligence<br />
collection&quot; &lt;1&gt;.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Beginnings<br />
<br />
In early 1972 I was involved in laser research at Stanford Research<br />
Institute (now called SRI International) in Menlo Park,<br />
CA. At that time I was also circulating a proposal to obtain a small grant<br />
for some research in quantum biology. In that<br />
proposal I had raised the issue whether physical theory as we knew it was<br />
capable of describing life processes, and had<br />
suggested some measurements involving plants and lower organisms &lt;3&gt;. This<br />
proposal was widely circulated, and a copy<br />
was sent to Cleve Backster in New York City who was involved in measuring<br />
the electrical activity of plants with standard<br />
polygraph equipment. New York artist Ingo Swann chanced to see my proposal<br />
during a visit to Backster's lab, and wrote<br />
me suggesting that if I were interested in investigating the boundary<br />
between the physics of the animate and inanimate, I should<br />
consider experiments of the parapsychological type. Swann then went on to<br />
describe some apparently successful experiments<br />
in psychokinesis in which he had participated at Prof. Gertrude Schmeidler's<br />
laboratory at the City College of New York. As<br />
a result of this correspondence I invited him to visit SRI for a week in<br />
June 1972 to demonstrate such effects, frankly, as<br />
much out of personal scientific curiosity as anything else.<br />
<br />
Prior to Swann's visit I arranged for access to a well-shielded magnetometer<br />
used in a quark-detection experiment in the<br />
Physics Department at Stanford University. During our visit to this<br />
laboratory, sprung as a surprise to Swann, he appeared to<br />
perturb the operation of the magnetometer, located in a vault below the<br />
floor of the building and shielded by mu-metal<br />
shielding, an aluminum container, copper shielding and a superconducting<br />
shield. As if to add insult to injury, he then went on<br />
to &quot;remote view&quot; the interior of the apparatus, rendering by drawing a<br />
reasonable facsimile of its rather complex (and<br />
heretofore unpublished) construction. It was this latter feat that impressed<br />
me perhaps even more than the former, as it also<br />
eventually did representatives of the intelligence community. I wrote up<br />
these observations and circulated it among my<br />
scientific colleagues in draft form of what was eventually published as part<br />
of a conference proceedings &lt;4&gt;.<br />
<br />
In a few short weeks a pair of visitors showed up at SRI with the above<br />
report in hand. Their credentials showed them to be<br />
from the CIA. They knew of my previous background as a Naval Intelligence<br />
Officer and then civilian employee at the<br />
National Security Agency (NSA) several years earlier, and felt they could<br />
discuss their concerns with me openly. There was,<br />
they told me, increasing concern in the intelligence community about the<br />
level of effort in Soviet parapsychology being funded<br />
by the Soviet security services &lt;5&gt;; by Western scientific standards the<br />
field was considered nonsense by most working<br />
scientists. As a result they had been on the lookout for a research<br />
laboratory outside of academia that could handle a quiet,<br />
low-profile classified investigation, and SRI appeared to fit the bill. They<br />
asked if I could arrange an opportunity for them to<br />
carry out some simple experiments with Swann, and, if the tests proved<br />
satisfactory, would I consider a pilot program along<br />
these lines? I agreed to consider this, and arranged for the requested<br />
tests.2<br />
<br />
The tests were simple, the visitors simply hiding objects in a box and<br />
asking Swann to attempt to describe the contents. The<br />
results generated in these experiments are perhaps captured most eloquently<br />
by the following example. In one test Swann said<br />
&quot;I see something small, brown and irregular, sort of like a leaf or<br />
something that resembles it, except that it seems very much<br />
alive, like it's even moving!&quot; The target chosen by one of the visitors<br />
turned out to be a small live moth, which indeed did look<br />
like a leaf. Although not all responses were quite so precise, nonetheless<br />
the integrated results were sufficiently impressive that<br />
in short order an eight-month, $49,909 Biofield Measurements Program was<br />
negotiated as a pilot study, a laser colleague<br />
Russell Targ who had a long-time interest and involvement in parapsychology<br />
joined the program, and the experimental<br />
effort was begun in earnest.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Early Remote Viewing Results<br />
<br />
During the eight-month pilot study of remote viewing the effort gradually<br />
evolved from the remote viewing of symbols and<br />
objects in envelopes and boxes, to the remote viewing of local target sites<br />
in the San Francisco Bay area, demarked by<br />
outbound experimenters sent to the site under strict protocols devised to<br />
prevent artifactual results. Later judging of the results<br />
were similarly handled by double-blind protocols designed to foil<br />
artifactual matching. Since these results have been presented<br />
in detail elsewhere, both in the scientific literature &lt;6-8&gt; and in popular<br />
book format &lt;9&gt;, I direct the interested reader to these<br />
sources. To summarize, over the years the back-and-forth criticism of<br />
protocols, refinement of methods, and successful<br />
replication of this type of remote viewing in independent laboratories<br />
&lt;10-14&gt;, has yielded considerable scientific evidence for<br />
the reality of the phenomenon. Adding to the strength of these results was<br />
the discovery that a growing number of individuals<br />
could be found to demonstrate high-quality remote viewing, often to their<br />
own surprise, such as the talented Hella Hammid.<br />
As a separate issue, however, most convincing to our early program monitors<br />
were the results now to be described,<br />
generated under their own control.<br />
<br />
First, during the collection of data for a formal remote viewing series<br />
targeting indoor laboratory apparatus and outdoor<br />
locations (a series eventually published in toto in the Proc. IEEE &lt;7&gt;), the<br />
CIA contract monitors, ever watchful for possible<br />
chicanery, participated as remote viewers themselves in order to critique<br />
the protocols. In this role three separate viewers,<br />
designated visitors V1 - V3 in the IEEE paper, contributed seven of the 55<br />
viewings, several of striking quality. Reference to<br />
the IEEE paper for a comparison of descriptions/drawings to pictures of the<br />
associated targets, generated by the contract<br />
monitors in their own viewings, leaves little doubt as to why the contract<br />
monitors came to the conclusion that there was<br />
something to remote viewing (see, for example, Figure 1 herein). As<br />
summarized in the Executive Summary of the<br />
now-released Final Report &lt;2&gt; of the second year of the program, &quot;The<br />
development of this capability at SRI has evolved to<br />
the point where visiting CIA personnel with no previous exposure to such<br />
concepts have performed well under controlled<br />
laboratory conditions (that is, generated target descriptions of<br />
sufficiently high quality to permit blind matching of descriptions<br />
to targets by independent judges).&quot; What happened next, however, made even<br />
these results pale in comparison.<br />
<br />

Coordinate Remote Viewing<br />
<br />
To determine whether it was necessary to have a &quot;beacon&quot; individual at the<br />
target site, Swann suggested carrying out an<br />
experiment to remote view the planet Jupiter before the upcoming NASA<br />
Pioneer 10 flyby. In that case, much to his chagrin<br />
(and ours) he found a ring around Jupiter, and wondered if perhaps he had<br />
remote viewed Saturn by mistake. Our colleagues<br />
in astronomy were quite unimpressed as well, until the flyby revealed that<br />
an unanticipated ring did in fact exist.3<br />
<br />
Expanding the protocols yet further, Swann proposed a series of experiments<br />
in which the target was designated not by<br />
sending a &quot;beacon&quot; person to the target site, but rather by the use of<br />
geographical coordinates, latitude and longitude in<br />
degrees, minutes and seconds. Needless to say, this proposal seemed even<br />
more outrageous than &quot;ordinary&quot; remote viewing.<br />
The difficulties in taking this proposal seriously, designing protocols to<br />
eliminate the possibility of a combination of globe<br />
memorization and eidetic or photographic memory, and so forth, are discussed<br />
in considerable detail in Reference &lt;9&gt;. Suffice<br />
it to say that investigation of this approach, which we designated Scanate<br />
(scanning by coordinate), eventually provided us<br />
with sufficient evidence to bring it up to the contract monitors and suggest<br />
a test under their control. A description of that test<br />
and its results, carried out in mid-1973 during the initial pilot study, are<br />
best presented by quoting directly from the Executive<br />
Summary of the Final Report of the second year's followup program &lt;2&gt;. The<br />
remote viewers were Ingo Swann and Pat<br />
Price, and the entire transcripts are available in the released documents<br />
&lt;2&gt;.<br />
<br />
&quot;In order to subject the remote viewing phenomena to a rigorous<br />
long-distance test under external control, a request for<br />
geographical coordinates of a site unknown to subject and experimenters was<br />
forwarded to the OSI group responsible for<br />
threat analysis in this area. In response, SRI personnel received a set of<br />
geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude in<br />
degrees, minutes, and seconds) of a facility, hereafter referred to as the<br />
West Virginia Site. The experimenters then carried<br />
out a remote viewing experiment on a double-blind basis, that is, blind to<br />
experimenters as well as subject. The experiment<br />
had as its goal the determination of the utility of remote viewing under<br />
conditions approximating an operational scenario. Two<br />
subjects targeted on the site, a sensitive installation. One subject drew a<br />
detailed map of the building and grounds layout, the<br />
other provided information about the interior including codewords, data<br />
subsequently verified by sponsor sources (report<br />
available from COTR).&quot;4<br />
<br />
Since details concerning the site's mission in general,5 and evaluation of<br />
the remote viewing test in particular, remain highly<br />
classified to this day, all that can be said is that interest in the client<br />
community was heightened considerably following this<br />
exercise.<br />
<br />
Because Price found the above exercise so interesting, as a personal<br />
challenge he went on to scan the other side of the globe<br />
for a Communist Bloc equivalent and found one located in the Urals, the<br />
detailed description of which is also included in Ref.<br />
&lt;2&gt;. As with the West Virginia Site, the report for the Urals Site was also<br />
verified by personnel in the sponsor organization as<br />
being substantially correct.<br />
<br />
What makes the West Virginia/Urals Sites viewings so remarkable is that<br />
these are not best-ever examples culled out of a<br />
longer list; these are literally the first two site-viewings carried out in<br />
a simulated operational-type scenario. In fact, for Price<br />
these were the very first two remote viewings in our program altogether, and<br />
he was invited to participate in yet further<br />
experimentation.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Operational Remote Viewing (Semipalatinsk, USSR)<br />
<br />
Midway through the second year of the program (July 1974) our CIA sponsor<br />
decided to challenge us to provide data on a<br />
Soviet site of ongoing operational significance. Pat Price was the remote<br />
viewer. A description of the remote viewing, taken<br />
from our declassified final report &lt;2&gt;, reads as given below. I cite this<br />
level of detail to indicate the thought that goes into such<br />
an &quot;experiment&quot; to minimize cueing while at the same time being responsive<br />
to the requirements of an operational situation.<br />
Again, this is not a &quot;best-ever&quot; example from a series of such viewings, but<br />
rather the very first operational Soviet target<br />
concerning which we were officially tasked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To determine the utility of remote viewing under operational conditions, a<br />
long-distance remote viewing experiment was<br />
carried out on a sponsor-designated target of current interest, an<br />
unidentified research center at Semipalatinsk, USSR.<br />
<br />
This experiment, carried out in three phases, was under direct control of<br />
the COTR. To begin the experiment, the COTR<br />
furnished map coordinates in degrees, minutes and seconds. The only<br />
additional information provided was the designation of<br />
the target as an R&amp;D test facility. The experimenters then closeted<br />
themselves with Subject S1, gave him the map coordinates<br />
and indicated the designation of the target as an R&amp;D test facility. A<br />
remote-viewing experiment was then carried out. This<br />
activity constituted Phase I of the experiment.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
                                      Figure 4 - Subject effort at crane<br />
construction <br />
<br />
<br />
Figure 3 shows the subject's graphic effort for building layout; Figure 4<br />
shows the subject's particular attention to a multistory<br />
gantry crane he observed at the site. Both results were obtained by the<br />
experimenters on a double-blind basis before<br />
exposure to any additional COTR-held information, thus eliminating the<br />
possibility of cueing. These results were turned over<br />
to the client representatives for evaluation. For comparison an artist's<br />
rendering of the site as known to the COTR (but not to<br />
the experimenters until later) is shown in Figure 5..... <br />
<br />
<br />
                    Figure 5 - Actual COTR rendering of Semipalatinsk, USSR<br />
target site<br />
<br />
Were the results not promising, the experiment would have stopped at this<br />
point. Description of the multistory crane,<br />
however, a relatively unusual target item, was taken as indicative of<br />
possible target acquisition. Therefore, Phase II was<br />
begun, defined by the subject being made &quot;witting&quot; (of the client) by client<br />
representatives who introduced themselves to the<br />
subject at that point; Phase II also included a second round of<br />
experimentation on the Semipalatinsk site with direct<br />
participation of client representatives in which further data were obtained<br />
and evaluated. As preparation for this phase, client<br />
representatives purposely kept themselves blind to all but general knowledge<br />
of the target site to minimize the possibility of<br />
cueing. The Phase II effort was focused on the generation of physical data<br />
that could be independently verified by other client<br />
sources, thus providing a calibration of the process.<br />
<br />
The end of Phase II gradually evolved into the first part of Phase III, the<br />
generation of unverifiable data concerning the<br />
Semipalatinsk site not available to the client, but of operational interest<br />
nonetheless. Several hours of tape transcript and a<br />
notebook of drawings were generated over a two-week period.<br />
<br />
The data describing the Semipalatinsk site were evaluated by the sponsor,<br />
and are contained in a separate report. In general,<br />
several details concerning the salient technology of the Semipalatinsk site<br />
appeared to dovetail with data from other sources,<br />
and a number of specific large structural elements were correctly described.<br />
The results contained noise along with the signal,<br />
but were nonetheless clearly differentiated from the chance results that<br />
were generated by control subjects in comparison<br />
experiments carried out by the COTR.&quot;<br />
<br />
For discussion of the ambiance and personal factors involved in carrying out<br />
this experiment, along with further detail<br />

comparison of Price's RV-generated information<br />
with later-determined &quot;ground-truth reality,&quot; see the accompanying article<br />

Exploration, Vol. 10, No. 1. Click here to read the abstract. <br />

<br />
Additional experiments having implications for intelligence concerns were<br />
carried out, such as the remote viewing of<br />
cipher-machine type apparatus, and the RV-sorting of sealed envelopes to<br />
differentiate those that contained letters with secret<br />
writing from those that did not. To discuss these here in detail would take<br />
us too far afield, but the interested reader can<br />
follow up by referring to the now-declassified project documents &lt;2&gt;. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Follow-on Programs<br />
<br />
The above discussion brings us up to the end of 1975. As a result of the<br />
material being generated by both SRI and CIA<br />
remote viewers, interest in the program in government circles, especially<br />
within the intelligence community, intensified<br />
considerably and led to an ever-increasing briefing schedule. This in turn<br />
led to an ever-increasing number of clients, contracts<br />
and tasking, and therefore expansion of the program to a multi-client base,<br />
and eventually to an integrated joint-services<br />
program under single-agency (DIA)6 leadership. To meet the demand for the<br />
increased level of effort we first increased our<br />
professional staff by inviting Ed May to join the program in 1976, then<br />
screened and added to the program a cadre of remote<br />
viewers as consultants, and let subcontracts to increase our scope of<br />
activity.<br />
<br />
As the program expanded, in only a very few cases could the clients'<br />
identities and program tasking be revealed. Examples<br />
include a NASA-funded study negotiated early in the program by Russ Targ to<br />
determine whether the internal state of an<br />
electronic random-number-generator could be detected by RV processes &lt;16&gt;,<br />
and a study funded by the Naval Electronics<br />
Systems Command to determine whether attempted remote viewing of distant<br />
light flashes would induce correlated changes in<br />
the viewer's brainwave (EEG) production &lt;17&gt;. For essentially all other<br />
projects during my 14-yr. tenure at SRI, however, the<br />
identity of the clients and most of the tasking were classified and remain<br />
so today. (The exception was the occasional<br />
privately-funded study.) We are told, however, that further declassification<br />
and release of much of this material is almost<br />
certain to occur.<br />
<br />
What can be said, then, about further development of the program in the two<br />
decades following 1975?7 In broad terms it can<br />
be said that much of the SRI effort was directed not so much toward<br />
developing an operational U.S. capability, but rather<br />
toward assessing the threat potential of its use against the U.S. by others.<br />
The words threat assessment were often used to<br />
describe the program's purpose during its development, especially during the<br />
early years. As a result much of the<br />
remote-viewing activity was carried out under conditions where ground-truth<br />
reality was a priori known or could be<br />
determined, such as the description of U.S. facilities and technological<br />
developments, the timing of rocket test firings and<br />
underground nuclear tests, and the location of individuals and mobile units.<br />
And, of course, we were responsive to requests to<br />
provide assistance during such events as the loss of an airplane or the<br />
taking of hostages, relying on the talents of an increasing<br />
cadre of remote-viewer/consultants, some well-known in the field such as<br />
Keith Harary, and many who have not surfaced<br />
publicly until recently, such as Joe McMoneagle.<br />
<br />
One might ask whether in this program RV-generated information was ever of<br />
sufficient significance as to influence decisions<br />
at a policy level. This is of course impossible to determine unless<br />
policymakers were to come forward with a statement in the<br />
affirmative. One example of a possible candidate is a study we performed at<br />
SRI during the Carter-administration debates<br />
concerning proposed deployment of the mobile MX missile system. In that<br />
scenario missiles were to be randomly shuffled<br />
from silo to silo in a silo field, in a form of high-tech shell game. In a<br />
computer simulation of a twenty-silo field with<br />
randomly-assigned (hidden) missile locations, we were able, using<br />
RV-generated data, to show rather forcefully that the<br />
application of a sophisticated statistical averaging technique (sequential<br />
sampling) could in principle permit an adversary to<br />
defeat the system. I briefed these results to the appropriate offices at<br />
their request, and a written report with the technical<br />
details was widely circulated among groups responsible for threat analysis<br />
&lt;18&gt;, and with some impact. What role, if any, our<br />
small contribution played in the mix of factors behind the enormously<br />
complex decision to cancel the program will probably<br />
never be known, and must of course a priori be considered in all likelihood<br />
negligible. Nonetheless, this is a prototypical<br />
example of the kind of tasking that by its nature potentially had policy<br />
implications.<br />
<br />
Even though the details of the broad range of experiments, some brilliant<br />
successes, many total failures, have not yet been<br />
released, we have nonetheless been able to publish summaries of what was<br />
learned in these studies about the overall<br />
characteristics of remote viewing, as in Table 5 of Reference &lt;8&gt;.<br />
Furthermore, over the years we were able to address<br />
certain questions of scientific interest in a rigorous way and to publish<br />
the results in the open literature. Examples include the<br />
apparent lack of attenuation of remote viewing due to seawater shielding<br />
(submersible experiments) &lt;8&gt;, the amplification of<br />
RV performance by use of error-correcting coding techniques &lt;19,20&gt;, and the<br />
utility of a technique we call associational<br />
remote viewing (ARV) to generate useful predictive information &lt;21&gt;.8<br />
<br />
As a sociological aside, we note that the overall efficacy of remote viewing<br />
in a program like this was not just a scientific issue.<br />
For example, when the Semipalatinsk data described earlier was forwarded for<br />
analysis, one group declined to get involved<br />
because the whole concept was unscientific nonsense, while a second group<br />
declined because, even though it might be real, it<br />
was possibly demonic; a third group had to be found. And, as in the case of<br />
public debate about such phenomena, the<br />
program's image was on occasion as likely to be damaged by an<br />
overenthusiastic supporter as by a detractor. Personalities,<br />
politics and personal biases were always factors to be dealt with.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Official Statements/Perspectives<br />
<br />
With regard to admission by the government of its use of remote viewers<br />
under operational conditions, officials have on<br />
occasion been relatively forthcoming. President Carter, in a speech to<br />
college students in Atlanta in September 1995, is<br />
quoted by Reuters as saying that during his administration a plane went down<br />
in Zaire, and a meticulous sweep of the African<br />
terrain by American spy satellites failed to locate any sign of the<br />
wreckage. It was then &quot;without my knowledge&quot; that the head<br />
of the CIA (Adm. Stansfield Turner) turned to a woman reputed to have<br />
psychic powers. As told by Carter, &quot;she gave some<br />
latitude and longitude figures. We focused our satellite cameras on that<br />
point and the plane was there.&quot; Independently, Turner<br />
himself also has admitted the Agency's use of a remote viewer (in this case,<br />
Pat Price).9 And recently, in a segment taped for<br />
the British television series Equinox &lt;22&gt;, Maj. Gen. Ed Thompson, Assistant<br />
Chief of Staff for Intelligence, U.S. Army<br />
(1977-1981), volunteered &quot;I had one or more briefings by SRI and was<br />
impressed.... The decision I made was to set up a<br />
small, in-house, low-cost effort in remote viewing....&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, a recent unclassified report &lt;23&gt; prepared for the CIA by the<br />
American Institutes for Research (AIR), concerning a<br />
remote viewing effort carried out under a DIA program called Star Gate<br />
(discussed in detail elsewhere in this volume), cites<br />
the roles of the CIA and DIA in the history of the program, including<br />
acknowledgment that a cadre of full-time government<br />
employees used remote viewing techniques to respond to tasking from<br />
operational military organizations.10<br />
<br />
As information concerning the various programs spawned by<br />
intelligence-community interest is released, and the dialog<br />
concerning their scientific and social significance is joined, the results<br />
are certain to be hotly debated. Bearing witness to this<br />
fact are the companion articles in this volume by Ed May, Director of the<br />
SRI and SAIC programs since 1985, and by<br />
Jessica Utts and Ray Hyman, consultants on the AIR evaluation cited above.<br />
These articles address in part the AIR study.<br />
That study, limited in scope to a small fragment of the overall program<br />
effort, resulted in a conclusion that although laboratory<br />
research showed statistically significant results, use of remote viewing in<br />
intelligence gathering was not warranted.<br />
<br />
Regardless of one's a priori position, however, an unimpassioned observer<br />
cannot help but attest to the following fact. Despite<br />
the ambiguities inherent in the type of exploration covered in these<br />
programs, the integrated results appear to provide<br />
unequivocal evidence of a human capacity to access events remote in space<br />
and time, however falteringly, by some cognitive<br />
process not yet understood. My years of involvement as a research manager in<br />
these programs have left me with the<br />
conviction that this fact must be taken into account in any attempt to<br />
develop an unbiased picture of the structure of reality.<br />

                          An Assessment of the Evidence for Psychic<br />
Functioning <br />

Research on psychic functioning, conducted over a two decade period, is<br />
examined to determine whether or not the<br />
phenomenon has been scientifically established. A secondary question is<br />
whether or not it is useful for government purposes.<br />
The primary work examined in this report was government sponsored research<br />
conducted at Stanford Research Institute,<br />
later known as SRI International, and at Science Applications International<br />
Corporation, known as SAIC. Using the<br />
standards applied to any other area of science, it is concluded that psychic<br />
functioning has been well established. The<br />
statistical results of the studies examined are far beyond what is expected<br />
by chance. Arguments that these results could be<br />
due to methodological flaws in the experiments are soundly refuted. Effects<br />
of similar magnitude to those found in<br />
government-sponsored research at SRI and SAIC have been replicated at a<br />
number of laboratories across the world. Such<br />
consistency cannot be readily explained by claims of flaws or fraud. The<br />
magnitude of psychic functioning exhibited appears<br />
to be in the range between what social scientists call a small and medium<br />
effect. That means that it is reliable enough to be<br />
replicated in properly conducted experiments, with sufficient trials to<br />
achieve the long-run statistical results needed for<br />
replicability. A number of other patterns have been found, suggestive of how<br />
to conduct more productive experiments and<br />
applied psychic functioning. For instance, it doesn't appear that a sender<br />
is needed. Precognition, in which the answer is<br />
known to no one until a future time, appears to work quite well. Recent<br />
experiments suggest that if there is a psychic sense<br />
then it works much like our other five senses, by detecting change. Given<br />
that physicists are currently grappling with an<br />
understanding of time, it may be that a psychic sense exists that scans the<br />
future for major change, much as our eyes scan the<br />
environment for visual change or our ears allow us to respond to sudden<br />
changes in sound. It is recommended that future<br />
experiments focus on understanding how this phenomenon works, and on how to<br />
make it as useful as possible. There is little<br />
benefit to continuing experiments designed to offer proof, since there is<br />
little more to be offered to anyone who does not<br />
accept the current collection of data. <br />

Jessica Utts and I were commissioned to evaluate the research on remote<br />
viewing and related phenomena which was carried<br />
out at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and Scientific Applications<br />
International Corporation (SAIC) during the years from<br />
1973 through 1994. We focussed on the ten most recent experiments which were<br />
conducted at SAIC from 1992 through<br />
1994. These were not only the most recent but also the most methodologically<br />
sound. We evaluated these experiments in the<br />
context of contemporary parapsychological research. Professor Utts concluded<br />
that the SAIC results, taken in conjunction<br />
with other parapsychological research, proved the existence of ESP,<br />
especially precognition. My report argues that Professor<br />
Utts' conclusion is premature, to say the least. The reports of the SAIC<br />
experiments have become accessible for public<br />
scrutiny too recently for adequate evaluation. Moreover, their findings have<br />
yet to be independently replicated. My report also<br />
argues that the apparent consistencies between the SAIC results and those of<br />
other parapsychological experiments may be<br />
illusory. Many important inconsistencies are emphasized. Even if the<br />
observed effects can be independently replicated, much<br />
more theoretical and empirical investigation would be needed before one<br />
could legitimately claim the existence of paranormal<br />
functioning. Note: This article is followed by a response from Jessica Utts.<br />

Hundreds of remote viewing experiments were carried out at Stanford Research<br />
Institute (SRI) from 1972 to 1986. The<br />
purpose of some of these trials was to elucidate the physical and<br />
psychological properties of psi abilities, while others were<br />
conducted to provide information for our CIA sponsor about current events in<br />
far off places. We learned that the accuracy<br />
and reliability of remote viewing was not in any way affected by distance,<br />
size, or electromagnetic shielding, and we<br />
discovered that the more exciting or demanding the task, the more likely we<br />
were to be successful. Above all, we became<br />
utterly convinced of the reality of psi abilities. This article focuses on<br />
two outstanding examples: One is an exceptional,<br />
map-like drawing of a Palo Alto swimming pool complex, and the other is an<br />
architecturally accurate drawing of a gantry<br />
crane located at a Soviet weapons laboratory, and verified by satellite<br />
photography. The percipient for both of these<br />
experiments was Pat Price, a retired police commissioner who was one of the<br />
most outstanding remote viewers to walk<br />
through the doors of SRI. <br />

As a result of a Congressionally Directed Activity, the Central Intelligence<br />
Agency conducted an evaluation of a 24-year,<br />
government-sponsored program to investigate ESP and its potential use within<br />
the Intelligence Community. The American<br />
Institutes for Research was contracted to conduct the review of both<br />
research and operations. Their 29 September 1995 final<br />
report was released to the public 28 November 1995. As a result of AIR's<br />
assessment, the CIA concluded that a statistically<br />
significant effect had been demonstrated in the laboratory, but that there<br />
was no case in which ESP had provided data that<br />
had ever been used to guide intelligence operations. This paper is a<br />
critical review of AIR's methodology and conclusions. It<br />
will be shown that there is compelling evidence that the CIA set the outcome<br />
with regard to intelligence usage before the<br />
evaluation had begun. This was accomplished by limiting the research and<br />
operations data sets to exclude positive findings, by<br />
purposefully not interviewing historically significant participants, by<br />
ignoring previous DOD extensive program reviews, and by<br />
using the discredited National Research Council's investigation of<br />
parapsychology as the starting point for their review. While<br />
there may have been political and administrative justification for the CIA<br />
not to accept the government's in-house program for<br />
the operational use of anomalous cognition, this appeared to drive the<br />
outcome of the evaluation. As a result, they have come<br />
to the wrong conclusion with regard to the use of anomalous cognition in<br />
intelligence operations and significantly<br />
underestimated the robustness of the basic phenomenon. <br />

Portable random event generators with software to record and index<br />
continuous sequences of binary data in field situations<br />
are found to produce anomalous outputs when deployed in various group<br />
environments. These &quot;FieldREG&quot; systems have<br />
been operated under formal protocols in ten separate venues, all of which<br />
subdivide naturally into temporal segments, such as<br />
sessions, presentations, or days. The most extreme data segments from each<br />
of the ten applications, after appropriate<br />
correction for multiple sampling, compound to a collective probability<br />
against chance expectation of 2 X 10^-4. Interpretation<br />
remains speculative at this point, but logbook notes and anecdotal reports<br />
from participants suggest that high degrees of<br />
attention, intellectual cohesiveness, shared emotion, or other coherent<br />
qualities of the groups tend to correlate with the<br />
statistically unusual deviations from theoretical expectation in the<br />
FieldREG sequences. If sustained over more extensive<br />
experiments, such effects could add credence to the concept of a<br />
consciousness &quot;field&quot; as an agency for creating order in<br />
random physical processes. <br />

Two experiments explored the hypothesis that when a group of people focus<br />
their attention on a common object of interest,<br />
order will arise in the environment. An electronic random number generator<br />
was used to detect these changes in order. Events<br />
judged to be interesting to the group were called periods of high coherence<br />
and were predicted to cause corresponding<br />
moments of order in the random samples collected during those events;<br />
uninteresting events were predicted to cause chance<br />
levels of order in the random samples. The first experiment was conducted<br />
during an all-day Holotropic Breathwork<br />
workshop. The predictions were confirmed, with a significant degree of order<br />
observed in the random samples during high<br />
group coherence periods (p = 0.002), and chance order observed during low<br />
group coherence periods (p = 0.43). The<br />
second experiment was conducted during the live television broadcast of the<br />
67th Annual Academy Awards. Two random<br />
binary generators, located 12 miles apart, were used to independently<br />
measure order. The predictions were confirmed for<br />
about half of the broadcast period, but the terminal cumulative<br />
probabilities were not significant. A post-hoc analysis showed<br />
that the strength of the correlation between the output of the two random<br />
generators was significantly related (r = 0.94) to the<br />
decline in the television viewing audience. <br />

     Abstract - In July 1995 the CIA declassified, and approved for release,<br />
documents revealing its sponsorship in the<br />
     1970s of a program at Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, CA, to<br />
determine whether such phenomena as<br />
     remote viewing &quot;might have any utility for intelligence collection&quot;<br />
&lt;1&gt;. Thus began disclosure to the public of a<br />
     two-decade-plus involvement of the intelligence community in the<br />
investigation of so-called parapsychological or psi<br />
     phenomena. Presented here by the program's Founder and first Director<br />
(1972 - 1985) is the early history of the<br />
     program, including discussion of some of the first, now declassified,<br />
results that drove early interest. <br />
       <br />
<br />
Introduction<br />
<br />
On April 17, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order Nr. 1995-4-17,<br />
entitled Classified National Security<br />
Information. Although in one sense the order simply reaffirmed much of what<br />
has been long-standing policy, in another sense<br />
there was a clear shift toward more openness. In the opening paragraph, for<br />
example, we read: &quot;In recent years, however,<br />
dramatic changes have altered, although not eliminated, the national<br />
security threats that we confront. These changes provide<br />
a greater opportunity to emphasize our commitment to open Government.&quot; In<br />
the Classification Standards section of the<br />
Order this commitment is operationalized by phrases such as &quot;If there is<br />
significant doubt about the need to classify<br />
information, it shall not be classified.&quot; Later in the document, in<br />
reference to information that requires continued protection,<br />
there even appears the remarkable phrase &quot;In some exceptional cases,<br />
however, the need to protect such information may be<br />
outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in<br />
these cases the information should be declassified.&quot;<br />
<br />
A major fallout of this reframing of attitude toward classification is that<br />
there is enormous pressure on those charged with<br />
maintaining security to work hard at being responsive to reasonable requests<br />
for disclosure. One of the results is that FOIA<br />
(Freedom of Information Act) requests that have languished for months to<br />
years are suddenly being acted upon.1 <br />
<br />
One outcome of this change in policy is the government's recent admission of<br />
its two-decade-plus involvement in funding<br />
highly-classified, special access programs in remote viewing (RV) and<br />
related psi phenomena, first at Stanford Research<br />
Institute (SRI) and then at Science Applications International Corporation<br />
(SAIC), both in Menlo Park, CA, supplemented<br />
by various in-house government programs. Although almost all of the<br />
documentation remains yet classified, in July 1995 270<br />
pages of SRI reports were declassified and released by the CIA, the<br />
program's first sponsor &lt;2&gt;. Thus, although through the<br />
years columns by Jack Anderson and others had claimed leaks of &quot;psychic spy&quot;<br />
programs with such exotic names as Grill<br />
Flame, Center Lane, Sunstreak and Star Gate, CIA's release of the SRI<br />
reports constitutes the first documented public<br />
admission of significant intelligence community involvement in the psi area.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a consequence of the above, although I had founded the program in early<br />
1972, and had acted as its Director until I left in<br />
1985 to head up the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin (at which point<br />
my colleague Ed May assumed responsibility as<br />
Director), it was not until 1995 that I found myself for the first time able<br />
to utter in a single sentence the connected acronyms<br />
CIA/SRI/RV. In this report I discuss the genesis of the program, report on<br />
some of the early, now declassified, results that<br />
drove early interest, and outline the general direction the program took as<br />
it expanded into a multi-year, multi-site,<br />
multi-million-dollar effort to determine whether such phenomena as remote<br />
viewing &quot;might have any utility for intelligence<br />
collection&quot; &lt;1&gt;.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Beginnings<br />
<br />
In early 1972 I was involved in laser research at Stanford Research<br />
Institute (now called SRI International) in Menlo Park,<br />
CA. At that time I was also circulating a proposal to obtain a small grant<br />
for some research in quantum biology. In that<br />
proposal I had raised the issue whether physical theory as we knew it was<br />
capable of describing life processes, and had<br />
suggested some measurements involving plants and lower organisms &lt;3&gt;. This<br />
proposal was widely circulated, and a copy<br />
was sent to Cleve Backster in New York City who was involved in measuring<br />
the electrical activity of plants with standard<br />
polygraph equipment. New York artist Ingo Swann chanced to see my proposal<br />
during a visit to Backster's lab, and wrote<br />
me suggesting that if I were interested in investigating the boundary<br />
between the physics of the animate and inanimate, I should<br />
consider experiments of the parapsychological type. Swann then went on to<br />
describe some apparently successful experiments<br />
in psychokinesis in which he had participated at Prof. Gertrude Schmeidler's<br />
laboratory at the City College of New York. As<br />
a result of this correspondence I invited him to visit SRI for a week in<br />
June 1972 to demonstrate such effects, frankly, as<br />
much out of personal scientific curiosity as anything else.<br />
<br />
Prior to Swann's visit I arranged for access to a well-shielded magnetometer<br />
used in a quark-detection experiment in the<br />
Physics Department at Stanford University. During our visit to this<br />
laboratory, sprung as a surprise to Swann, he appeared to<br />
perturb the operation of the magnetometer, located in a vault below the<br />
floor of the building and shielded by mu-metal<br />
shielding, an aluminum container, copper shielding and a superconducting<br />
shield. As if to add insult to injury, he then went on<br />
to &quot;remote view&quot; the interior of the apparatus, rendering by drawing a<br />
reasonable facsimile of its rather complex (and<br />
heretofore unpublished) construction. It was this latter feat that impressed<br />
me perhaps even more than the former, as it also<br />
eventually did representatives of the intelligence community. I wrote up<br />
these observations and circulated it among my<br />
scientific colleagues in draft form of what was eventually published as part<br />
of a conference proceedings &lt;4&gt;.<br />
<br />
In a few short weeks a pair of visitors showed up at SRI with the above<br />
report in hand. Their credentials showed them to be<br />
from the CIA. They knew of my previous background as a Naval Intelligence<br />
Officer and then civilian employee at the<br />
National Security Agency (NSA) several years earlier, and felt they could<br />
discuss their concerns with me openly. There was,<br />
they told me, increasing concern in the intelligence community about the<br />
level of effort in Soviet parapsychology being funded<br />
by the Soviet security services &lt;5&gt;; by Western scientific standards the<br />
field was considered nonsense by most working<br />
scientists. As a result they had been on the lookout for a research<br />
laboratory outside of academia that could handle a quiet,<br />
low-profile classified investigation, and SRI appeared to fit the bill. They<br />
asked if I could arrange an opportunity for them to<br />
carry out some simple experiments with Swann, and, if the tests proved<br />
satisfactory, would I consider a pilot program along<br />
these lines? I agreed to consider this, and arranged for the requested<br />
tests.2<br />
<br />
The tests were simple, the visitors simply hiding objects in a box and<br />
asking Swann to attempt to describe the contents. The<br />
results generated in these experiments are perhaps captured most eloquently<br />
by the following example. In one test Swann said<br />
&quot;I see something small, brown and irregular, sort of like a leaf or<br />
something that resembles it, except that it seems very much<br />
alive, like it's even moving!&quot; The target chosen by one of the visitors<br />
turned out to be a small live moth, which indeed did look<br />
like a leaf. Although not all responses were quite so precise, nonetheless<br />
the integrated results were sufficiently impressive that<br />
in short order an eight-month, $49,909 Biofield Measurements Program was<br />
negotiated as a pilot study, a laser colleague<br />
Russell Targ who had a long-time interest and involvement in parapsychology<br />
joined the program, and the experimental<br />
effort was begun in earnest.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Early Remote Viewing Results<br />
<br />
During the eight-month pilot study of remote viewing the effort gradually<br />
evolved from the remote viewing of symbols and<br />
objects in envelopes and boxes, to the remote viewing of local target sites<br />
in the San Francisco Bay area, demarked by<br />
outbound experimenters sent to the site under strict protocols devised to<br />
prevent artifactual results. Later judging of the results<br />
were similarly handled by double-blind protocols designed to foil<br />
artifactual matching. Since these results have been presented<br />
in detail elsewhere, both in the scientific literature &lt;6-8&gt; and in popular<br />
book format &lt;9&gt;, I direct the interested reader to these<br />
sources. To summarize, over the years the back-and-forth criticism of<br />
protocols, refinement of methods, and successful<br />
replication of this type of remote viewing in independent laboratories<br />
&lt;10-14&gt;, has yielded considerable scientific evidence for<br />
the reality of the phenomenon. Adding to the strength of these results was<br />
the discovery that a growing number of individuals<br />
could be found to demonstrate high-quality remote viewing, often to their<br />
own surprise, such as the talented Hella Hammid.<br />
As a separate issue, however, most convincing to our early program monitors<br />
were the results now to be described,<br />
generated under their own control.<br />
<br />
First, during the collection of data for a formal remote viewing series<br />
targeting indoor laboratory apparatus and outdoor<br />
locations (a series eventually published in toto in the Proc. IEEE &lt;7&gt;), the<br />
CIA contract monitors, ever watchful for possible<br />
chicanery, participated as remote viewers themselves in order to critique<br />
the protocols. In this role three separate viewers,<br />
designated visitors V1 - V3 in the IEEE paper, contributed seven of the 55<br />
viewings, several of striking quality. Reference to<br />
the IEEE paper for a comparison of descriptions/drawings to pictures of the<br />
associated targets, generated by the contract<br />
monitors in their own viewings, leaves little doubt as to why the contract<br />
monitors came to the conclusion that there was<br />
something to remote viewing (see, for example, Figure 1 herein). As<br />
summarized in the Executive Summary of the<br />
now-released Final Report &lt;2&gt; of the second year of the program, &quot;The<br />
development of this</div>
