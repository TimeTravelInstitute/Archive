<br />
<br />
Don't know if this is a conspiracy or bunch of strange coincidences and or the worst business decision in history...<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's review....<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>David Rockefeller championed the World Center....</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center</a><br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The World Trade Center in New York City (sometimes informally referred to as the WTC or the Twin Towers) was a complex of seven buildings in Lower Manhattan, mostly designed by American architect Minoru Yamasaki and engineer Leslie Robertson and developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It was initiated in 1960 by a Lower Manhattan Association created and chaired by David Rockefeller, who had the original idea of building the Center, with strong backing from the then-New York governor, his brother Nelson Rockefeller.[2] The World Trade Center, New York, like most all World Trade Centers located around the globe, belonged to the family of World Trade Centers Association. Larry Silverstein held the most recent lease to the complex, the Port Authority having leased it to him in July 2001.[3] The complex, located in the heart of New York City's downtown financial district, contained 13.4 million square feet (1.24 million m²) of office space, almost four percent of Manhattan's entire office inventory at that time.[4]&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey runs and owns the World Trader Center...</b><br />
<br />
<br />
History<br />
<br />
<br />
In the early years of the 20th century, there were disputes between the states of New Jersey and New York, over rail freights and boundaries. At the time, rail lines terminated on the New Jersey side of the harbor, while ocean shipping was centered on Manhattan and Brooklyn. Freight had to be shipped across the Hudson River in barges.[4] In 1916, New Jersey launched a lawsuit against New York over issues of rail freight, with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) issuing an order that the two states work together, subordinating their own interests to the public interest.[5] The Harbor Development Commission, a joint advisory board set-up in 1917, recommended that a bi-state authority be established to oversee efficient economic development of the port district.[6] The Port Authority of New York was established on April 30, 1921,[7] through an interstate compact between the states of New Jersey and New York. This was the first such agency in the United States, created under a provision in the Constitution of the United States permitting interstate compacts.[1] The idea for the Port Authority was conceived during the Progressive Era, which aimed to reduce political corruption and aimed for efficiency in government. With the Port Authority at a distance from political pressures, it was able to carry longer-term infrastructure projects irrespective of the election cycles and in a more efficient manner.[8] Throughout its history, there have also been concerns about democratic accountability, or lack thereof at the Port Authority.[8]&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>World Trade Center site</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Main article: World Trade Center site<br />
<br />
<br />
As owner of the World Trade Center site, the Port Authority has worked since 2001 on plans for reconstruction of the site, along with Silverstein Properties, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. In 2006, the Port Authority reached a deal with Larry Silverstein, which ceded control of the Freedom Tower to the Port Authority.[26] The deal gave Silverstein rights to build three towers along the eastern side of the site, including 150 Greenwich Street, 175 Greenwich Street, and 200 Greenwich Street.[26] Also part of the plans, is the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, which will replace the temporary PATH station that opened in November 2003.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Port Authority to NY/NJ leases the World Trade Center, their HQ, to Larry Silverstein shortly before September, 11, 2001 on July, 24, 2001. ?</b><br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;However, Vornado withdrew and Silverstein's bid for the lease to the World Trade Center was accepted on July 24, 2001,&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The deal was described in a press release on July 24, 2001: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Silverstein" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Silverstein</a><br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Silverstein Properties, Inc., and Westfield America, Inc. will lease the Twin Towers and other portions of the complex in a deal worth approximately $3.2 billion â€“ the city's richest real estate deal ever and one of the largest privatization initiatives in history. [4]&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The lease agreement applied to One, Two, Four and Five World Trade Center, and about 425,000 square feet of retail space. Silverstein put up only $14 million of his own money [5]. Silverstein was also given the right to rebuild the structures, should they be destroyed. [6]<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The World Trade Center is destroyed on September 11, 2001.</b><br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;In total, Silverstein was awarded nearly $5 billion in insurance money following the destruction of the Twin Towers [14]. He plans to use some or all of the settlement to rebuild. [15] The World Trade Center had a total of 24 insurance policies. In 2007, 6 years after the attacks, Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey filed a $1 billion lawsuit ($250 million in unpaid claims and $750 million in damages) against Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Group Plc and its U.S. affiliate.[16]<br />
<br />
<br />
Silverstein's lease with the Port Authority for the World Trade Center requires him to continue paying $102 million annually in base rent.[17] He is applying insurance payments toward the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site.[18]&quot;<br />

After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States Congress approved $8 billion in tax-exempt Liberty Bonds to fund development in the private sector at lower-than-market interest rates. $3.4 billion remained unallocated in March 2006 designated for Lower Manhattan, with about half of the funds under the control of Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the other half under the control of former Governor George Pataki.<br />

At the time, economic growth was concentrated in Midtown Manhattan, with Lower Manhattan left out. One notable exception was the construction of One Chase Manhattan Plaza in the Financial District, by David Rockefeller who led urban renewal efforts in Lower Manhattan.[9]<br />
<br />
<br />
In initial plans made public in 1961, the World Trade Center was slated to be built on a site along the East River.<br />

<b>Before the WTC 911 Attacks... Weren't the Commissoners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey?</b><br />
<br />
<br />
The members of the Hudson County Democratic Committee the HCDO and various local Hudson County and New Jersey state officials?<br />
<br />
<br />
Why the change?<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't sound like the Port Authority dumped the towers for peanuts to Larry Silverstein just before the attacks so he can collect 5 Billions?<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Nah! That's just crazy!!!</b><br />
<br />
<br />
The Port Authority didn't know the attack was COMING on 9/11?<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Nah! That's just crazy!!!</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Larry Silverstein didn't take 24 insurance polices because he knew that the towers were going to be attacked and collected 5 billion DOLLARS.<br />
<br />
<br />
MOSSOUD and ISRAEL INTELLIGENCE AGENTS weren't in New Jersey watching the attack laughing and cheering and VIDEO TAPING as reported 60 Minutes...<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Nah! That's just crazy!!!</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Larry Silverstein and David Rockefeller don't have connections to AIPAC, ISRAELI, UNITED KINGDOM, MOSSAUD, AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES and the MILITARY INDUSTRAIL COMPLEX...<br />
<br />
<br />
An intelligence agency such as the FBI could not find links to all these people via CONFERENCES, PARTIES, GROUPS, ORGANIZATIONS, MEETINGS, LUNCHES, VACATION DESTINATIONS, PHONE CALLS, MEETINGS and SECRET SOCIETIES such as CFR and TRILATERAL COMMISSION and THE BILDERBERGERS ETC...<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Nah! That's just crazy!!!</b><br />
<br />
<br />
And how Larry Silverstein doesn't seem to belong to ANY GROUP or SOCEITY... CONVENIENT? Isn't It?<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Nah! That's just crazy!!!</b><br />
<br />
<br />
That there was a MASSIVE CONSPIRACY to DESTROY THE WTC on 9/11?!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Nah! That's just crazy!!!</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Something to think about...<br />

Why did I hear stories about them gathering up &quot;plane debris&quot;...?<br />

Why did firemen come from all parts of the country?...<br />

Why did the residents of the surrounding apartments downtown manhattan complain about missing stuff?<br />

What happened to all the money and safety deposit boxes of the many banks in the World Trade Center Towers? Was anything recovered or reported? I didn't hear any...<br />

Why were they &quot;warned&quot; about building Tower 7 was &quot;coming down&quot;...<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>FAA Managers Destroyed 9/11 Tape</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Recording Contained Accounts of Communications With Hijacked Planes<br />
<br />
<br />
By Sara Kehaulani Goo<br />
<br />
<br />
Washington Post Staff Writer<br />
<br />
<br />
Thursday, May 6, 2004; 6:16 PM<br />
<br />
<br />
Six air traffic controllers provided accounts of their communications with hijacked planes on Sept. 11, 2001, on a tape recording that was later destroyed by Federal Aviation Administration managers, according to a government investigative report issued today.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is unclear what information was on the tape because no one ever listened to, transcribed or duplicated it, the report by the Department of Transportation inspector general said.<br />
<br />
<br />
The report concluded that the FAA generally cooperated with the independent panel investigating the terrorist attacks by providing documents about its activities on Sept. 11, but the actions of two FAA managers &quot;did not, in our view, serve the interests of the FAA, the Department [of Transportation] or the public.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The report was conducted at the request of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) after the panel investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, officially known as the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, complained that the FAA had been less than forthcoming in turning over documents and issued a subpoena to the agency for more information.<br />
<br />
<br />
The FAA said it was cooperating fully with the 9/11 panel. The agency said it took disciplinary action against the employee who destroyed the tape but declined to elaborate on what kind of action they took. [Earlier, an FAA official incorrectly stated that the agency took action against two employees in the case.]<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We believe the audiotape in question appears to be consistent with written statements and other materials provided to FBI investigators and would not have added in any significant way to the information contained in what has already been provided to investigators and members of the 9/11 commission,&quot; said FAA spokesman Greg Martin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hours after the hijacked planes flew into the World Trade Center Towers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, an FAA manager at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center gathered six controllers who communicated or tracked two of the hijacked planes and recorded in a one-hour interview their personal accounts of what occurred, the report stated.<br />
<br />
<br />
The manager, who is not named in the report, said that his intentions were to provide quick information to federal officials investigating the attack before the air traffic controllers involved took sick leave for the stress of their experiences, as is common practice.<br />
<br />
<br />
According to the report, a second manager at the New York center promised a union official representing the controllers that he would &quot;get rid of&quot; the tape after controllers used it to provide written statements to federal officials about the events of the day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instead, the second manager said he destroyed the tape between December 2001 and January 2002 by crushing the tape with his hand, cutting it into small pieces and depositing the pieces into trash cans around the building, the report said.<br />
<br />
<br />
The tape's existence was never made known to federal officials investigating the attack, nor to FAA officials in Washington. Staff members of the 9/11 panel found out about the tape during interviews with some controllers who participated in the recording.<br />
<br />
<br />
One controller said she asked to listen to the tape in order to prepare her written account of her experience, but one of the managers denied her request.<br />
<br />
<br />
The New York managers acknowledged that they received an e-mail from FAA officials instructing them to retain all materials related to the Sept. 11 attacks. &quot;If a question arises whether or not you should retain the data, RETAIN IT,&quot; the report quoted the e-mail as saying.<br />
<br />
<br />
But the managers decided not to include the tape in a November 2001 &quot;Formal Accident Package&quot; report the office prepared because one manager said he did not want to break his word to the union official and he did not think the tape should ever have been made.<br />
<br />
<br />
The inspector general concluded today that the managers' actions resulted in the loss of potential evidence that would allow the 9/11 commission to compare controllers' recollection of the events immediately after the attacks with the written statements prepared three weeks later.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The destruction of evidence in the Government's possession, in this case an audiotape -- particularly during times of national crisis -- has the effect of fostering an appearance that information is being withheld from the public.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Why destroy the TAPES? To keep the idea that there were multiple ECHOS of PLANES and SOME PLANES LANDED and OTHERS CRASHED?<br />

It was initiated in 1960 by a Lower Manhattan Association created and chaired by David Rockefeller, who had the original idea of building the Center, with strong backing from the then-New York governor, his brother Nelson Rockefeller.[2] The World Trade Center, New York, like most all World Trade Centers located around the globe, belonged to the family of World Trade Centers Association. Larry Silverstein held the most recent lease to the complex, the Port Authority having leased it to him in July 2001.[3] The complex, located in the heart of New York City's downtown financial district, contained 13.4 million square feet (1.24 million m²) of office space, almost four percent of Manhattan's entire office inventory at that time.[4]\"\n\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey runs and owns the World Trader Center...\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, there were disputes between the states of New Jersey and New York, over rail freights and boundaries. At the time, rail lines terminated on the New Jersey side of the harbor, while ocean shipping was centered on Manhattan and Brooklyn. Freight had to be shipped across the Hudson River in barges.[4] In 1916, New Jersey launched a lawsuit against New York over issues of rail freight, with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) issuing an order that the two states work together, subordinating their own interests to the public interest.[5] The Harbor Development Commission, a joint advisory board set-up in 1917, recommended that a bi-state authority be established to oversee efficient economic development of the port district.[6] The Port Authority of New York was established on April 30, 1921,[7] through an interstate compact between the states of New Jersey and New York. This was the first such agency in the United States, created under a provision in the Constitution of the United States permitting interstate compacts.[1] The idea for the Port Authority was conceived during the Progressive Era, which aimed to reduce political corruption and aimed for efficiency in government. With the Port Authority at a distance from political pressures, it was able to carry longer-term infrastructure projects irrespective of the election cycles and in a more efficient manner.[8] Throughout its history, there have also been concerns about democratic accountability, or lack thereof at the Port Authority.[8]\"\n\n\nWorld Trade Center site\n\n\nMain article: World Trade Center site\n\n\nAs owner of the World Trade Center site, the Port Authority has worked since 2001 on plans for reconstruction of the site, along with Silverstein Properties, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. In 2006, the Port Authority reached a deal with Larry Silverstein, which ceded control of the Freedom Tower to the Port Authority.[26] The deal gave Silverstein rights to build three towers along the eastern side of the site, including 150 Greenwich Street, 175 Greenwich Street, and 200 Greenwich Street.[26] Also part of the plans, is the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, which will replace the temporary PATH station that opened in November 2003.\n\n\nThe Port Authority to NY\/NJ leases the World Trade Center, their HQ, to Larry Silverstein shortly before September, 11, 2001 on July, 24, 2001. ?\n\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Larry_Silverstein\n\n\n\"However, Vornado withdrew and Silverstein's bid for the lease to the World Trade Center was accepted on July 24, 2001,\"\n\n\nThe deal was described in a press release on July 24, 2001: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Larry_Silverstein\n\n\n\"Silverstein Properties, Inc., and Westfield America, Inc. will lease the Twin Towers and other portions of the complex in a deal worth approximately $3.2 billion â€“ the city's richest real estate deal ever and one of the largest privatization initiatives in history. [4]\"\n\n\nThe lease agreement applied to One, Two, Four and Five World Trade Center, and about 425,000 square feet of retail space. Silverstein put up only $14 million of his own money [5]. Silverstein was also given the right to rebuild the structures, should they be destroyed. [6]\n\n\nThe World Trade Center is destroyed on September 11, 2001.\n\n\n[\/b]Larry Silverstein has the right to rebuild the WTC and collect 5\"-8\" Billion[\/b]\n\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Larry_Silverstein\n\n\n\"In total, Silverstein was awarded nearly $5 billion in insurance money following the destruction of the Twin Towers [14]. He plans to use some or all of the settlement to rebuild. [15] The World Trade Center had a total of 24 insurance policies. In 2007, 6 years after the attacks, Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey filed a $1 billion lawsuit ($250 million in unpaid claims and $750 million in damages) against Royal & Sun Alliance Group Plc and its U.S. affiliate.[16]\n\n\nSilverstein's lease with the Port Authority for the World Trade Center requires him to continue paying $102 million annually in base rent.[17] He is applying insurance payments toward the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site.[18]\"\n\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Port_Authority_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey\n\n\nFootnote:\n\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Port_Authority_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey\n\n\nThe Bayonne Bridge, opened in 1931, was built across the Kill van Kull, connecting Staten Island with Bayonne, New Jersey.[9]\n\n\nFootnote:\n\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Larry_Silverstein\n\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States Congress approved $8 billion in tax-exempt Liberty Bonds to fund development in the private sector at lower-than-market interest rates. $3.4 billion remained unallocated in March 2006 designated for Lower Manhattan, with about half of the funds under the control of Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the other half under the control of former Governor George Pataki.\n\n\nFootnote:\n\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Larry_Silverstein\n\n\nAt the time, economic growth was concentrated in Midtown Manhattan, with Lower Manhattan left out. One notable exception was the construction of One Chase Manhattan Plaza in the Financial District, by David Rockefeller who led urban renewal efforts in Lower Manhattan.[9]\n\n\nIn initial plans made public in 1961, the World Trade Center was slated to be built on a site along the East River.\n\n\nFootnote:\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Hess, Diane. \"Moody's to sell headquarters to Silverstein\", New York Business, November 21, 2006.\n\n\nWho are the board members of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey?\n\n\nBoard of Commissioners\n\n\nAnthony R.
