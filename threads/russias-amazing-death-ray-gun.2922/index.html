<br />
Is there a potential within our future to replace ballistic weapons?<br />
Perhaps it may!  --- The very concept of alternative weaponry carries less risk of unintended fatalities, while reducing the expense to produce ammunition. since the replacement ammo would be composed of a magnetic electrical containment unit of sorts, it would only require the user to ensure a good charge remains within the unit's battery and supercharging system. <br />
<br />
The implications point to how this new form of alternative weaponry may some day provide us with, yet another distinct tool of opportunity, while providing a means to expidite the processes of delivering more effective global, and social economic reforms that may have been much more difficult to improve upon otherwise. One of the gratest hopes for humanity to improve upon our current social environment in ways that would enable us to evolve into a more advanced form of peaceful humans, thus something as simple as finding an alternative to ballistic weapons and other forms of destructive devices out of our hands may open many other new opportunities for social mass evolution. Who knows for certain? Only &quot;Time&quot; will tell.<br />
<br />
Solutions like these do offer us the potential to create a much grander collective unification on a more peaceful platform, yet on the other hand, it may open up a new pathway leading to greater dangers ahead if we don't use it responsibly and allow the technology to progress towards a more destructive use. The outcome of such technologies depends upon how we choose to use these devices. Like any new technology that becomes available, (and mass produced), we can either use it to preserve life, or destroy it. In any case, it always comes down to intent. <br />
<br />
Primarily, if such noble intentions are persued to ensure we use this technology to emancipate humanity, instead of destroying ourselves with it, perhaps we may stand a much greater opportunity to evolve providing that we continue to put such technology to proper use, while striving towards a more harmonic, and peaceful evolvement, and one that resonates with the objective to provide humanity as a whole, with an equal opportunity to participate, and be equally rewarded for their efforts.<br />
<br />
In order to do what is demanded of us to make progressive steps towards such a peaceful global unification, it will take a great effort of continued dedication, and countless contributions of self sacrifices if we wish to actively persue such noble intentions. moreover, it will require our global leaders to &quot;Lead By Example&quot; by setting the example for everyone else to follow. If we are to be led towards a more peaceful, and advanced form of human social development, then we must demand of our global leaders to deliver a more effective means to establish a Cooperative Global Government as such. <br />
<br />
Such an environment that restrains themselves enough to take on the initiative, and self discipline one under such a global reform as mentioned,  perhaps may no longer require the need to continue drawing lines in the sand. <br />
<br />
Regardless if such a dream of a global utopia could be possible, (let alone withstand the test of &quot;Time&quot;) only courage to change, and the strong desire for effective change accompanied by the willingness to get outside the confines of our comfort zones while taking on the challenge of casting away our need to live in fear of one another, only then we may discover what is required of us to lay the foundations to start taking positive and effective steps that would get us closer to such peaceful objectives.<br />
<br />
From Alternative weapons, to Molecular biology; any promise to show good faith for these new technological advancements have the ability to demonstrate to us how they can effectively improve upon the quality of our lives, yet it is of our own choosing which can make us, or break us. It all depends on where our sense, and sensibilities remain during the progressions of such aspirations. it is the actions we apply as a whole, that determines the outcome of what becomes of technology and human advancement, thus it relies upon the center of our intent as a whole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technology doesn't kill people, People &quot;Do&quot;.<br />

&quot;Shielding is ineffective. The scalar pulse (or continuous wave)<br />
can go anywhere gravity can go. It penetrates the steel hull of<br />
tanks and armored vehicles. It penetrates underground shelters and<br />
bunkers. It penetrates pillboxes and fortifications. Foxholes are<br />
no protection. Just shoot through the earth into them. There is no<br />
longer any place to hide.&quot;<br />

* The Soviet Challenge In Space: Illustrating The Threat<br />
Defensive Weapons Beginning in the 1960s, the Soviet Union conducted a substantial<br />
research program to develop a defense against ballistic missiles. The<br />
Soviets built, and Russia continues to maintain, the world's only<br />
operational anti-ballistic missile system. Additional programs<br />
focused on the development of other ground- and space-based weapons<br />
using laser, particle beam, and kinetic energy technology.<br />

* Space Weapons in Development<br />
<br />
The U.S. Space Command doesn't hide the fact that it wants to<br />
establish U.S. supremacy in space. In its Vision for 2020 report, the<br />
Space Command points out that military forces have always evolved to<br />
protect national interests, both military and economic. The report<br />
suggests that space weapons must be developed to protect U.S.<br />
satellites, and other space vehicles, as other countries develop the<br />
ability to launch spacecraft into space. In 1997, Assistant Secretary<br />
of the Air Force for Space, Keith R. Hall, said, &quot;With regard to<br />
space dominance, we have it, we like it and we're going to keep it.&quot;<br />
The Pentagon has said that as space enterprises begin to gain<br />
commercial advantage, there will be those who try to take some of the<br />
profits by attacking those space enterprises. Here are some of the<br />
space weapons currently under development:<br />
<br />
Chemical Lasers, Particle Beams, and Military Space Planes.<br />
There are at least three laser systems being developed for either<br />
space-based or ground-based weapons. All three are a type of chemical<br />
laser that involves the mixing of chemicals inside the weapon to<br />
create a laser beam. While a space-based laser system is still about<br />
20 years from being realized, there are three lasers being considered<br />
for it, including hydrogen fluoride (HF), deuterium fluoride (DF) and<br />
chemical oxygen iodine (COIL).<br />

 * Proton Gun<br />
(The business end of a mobile particle accelerator.)<br />
<br />
Okay, there are no such things as ghosts. However, there are weapons<br />
that you might use to fight them; chief among these is the Proton Gun, a kind of particle-beam weapon, developed for the famous Ghostbusters. Particle-beam weapons are devices that accelerate subatomic particles or atoms to velocities near the speed of light,<br />
focused into a narrow stream. The energy of the weapon is the aggregate kinetic energy of the individual particles forming the beam. A lightning bolt, a flow of electrons, is similar to a particle<br />
beam. For those still keeping up with these weapons, there are two general types, classified by their use: charged particle-beam weapons (endoatmospheric use) and neutral particle-beam weapons (exoatmospheric use).<br />

 [GURPS TL 08-13]<br />
<br />
There were a number of severe technological hurdles in the<br />
development of hand-held, high-energy weapons that could not be<br />
crossed until very recently. Even so limitations of the power cell<br />
technology (see the power cell section farther on) has prevented them<br />
from functioning in the normal fashion. All high energy weapons<br />
cannot be powered by power cells, they must use power cartridges<br />
(GURPS Ultra-Tech, page 60) or be directly powered from a reactor or<br />
similar.<br />

			"articleBody": "Russia's Amazing Death Ray Gun...\n\nIs there a potential within our future to replace ballistic weapons?\nPerhaps it may!  --- The very concept of alternative weaponry carries less risk of unintended fatalities, while reducing the expense to produce ammunition. since the replacement ammo would be composed of a magnetic electrical containment unit of sorts, it would only require the user to ensure a good charge remains within the unit's battery and supercharging system. \n\nThe implications point to how this new form of alternative weaponry may some day provide us with, yet another distinct tool of opportunity, while providing a means to expidite the processes of delivering more effective global, and social economic reforms that may have been much more difficult to improve upon otherwise. One of the gratest hopes for humanity to improve upon our current social environment in ways that would enable us to evolve into a more advanced form of peaceful humans, thus something as simple as finding an alternative to ballistic weapons and other forms of destructive devices out of our hands may open many other new opportunities for social mass evolution. Who knows for certain? Only \"Time\" will tell.\n\nSolutions like these do offer us the potential to create a much grander collective unification on a more peaceful platform, yet on the other hand, it may open up a new pathway leading to greater dangers ahead if we don't use it responsibly and allow the technology to progress towards a more destructive use. The outcome of such technologies depends upon how we choose to use these devices. Like any new technology that becomes available, (and mass produced), we can either use it to preserve life, or destroy it. In any case, it always comes down to intent. \n\nPrimarily, if such noble intentions are persued to ensure we use this technology to emancipate humanity, instead of destroying ourselves with it, perhaps we may stand a much greater opportunity to evolve providing that we continue to put such technology to proper use, while striving towards a more harmonic, and peaceful evolvement, and one that resonates with the objective to provide humanity as a whole, with an equal opportunity to participate, and be equally rewarded for their efforts.\n\nIn order to do what is demanded of us to make progressive steps towards such a peaceful global unification, it will take a great effort of continued dedication, and countless contributions of self sacrifices if we wish to actively persue such noble intentions. moreover, it will require our global leaders to \"Lead By Example\" by setting the example for everyone else to follow. If we are to be led towards a more peaceful, and advanced form of human social development, then we must demand of our global leaders to deliver a more effective means to establish a Cooperative Global Government as such. \n\nSuch an environment that restrains themselves enough to take on the initiative, and self discipline one under such a global reform as mentioned,  perhaps may no longer require the need to continue drawing lines in the sand. \n\nRegardless if such a dream of a global utopia could be possible, (let alone withstand the test of \"Time\") only courage to change, and the strong desire for effective change accompanied by the willingness to get outside the confines of our comfort zones while taking on the challenge of casting away our need to live in fear of one another, only then we may discover what is required of us to lay the foundations to start taking positive and effective steps that would get us closer to such peaceful objectives.\n\nFrom Alternative weapons, to Molecular biology; any promise to show good faith for these new technological advancements have the ability to demonstrate to us how they can effectively improve upon the quality of our lives, yet it is of our own choosing which can make us, or break us. It all depends on where our sense, and sensibilities remain during the progressions of such aspirations. it is the actions we apply as a whole, that determines the outcome of what becomes of technology and human advancement, thus it relies upon the center of our intent as a whole.\n\n\"Technology doesn't kill people, People \"Do\".\n\n---Gary Voss\n\n  Alternative Solutions For Modern Defense Weaponry ?\n\n\"Shielding is ineffective. The scalar pulse (or continuous wave)\ncan go anywhere gravity can go. It penetrates the steel hull of\ntanks and armored vehicles. It penetrates underground shelters and\nbunkers. It penetrates pillboxes and fortifications. Foxholes are\nno protection. Just shoot through the earth into them. There is no\nlonger any place to hide.\"\nhttp:\/\/www.tldm.org\/news4\/deathraygun.htm\n\n--- [Additional Ref\/s]---\n\n* The Soviet Challenge In Space: Illustrating The Threat\nDefensive Weapons Beginning in the 1960s, the Soviet Union conducted a substantial\nresearch program to develop a defense against ballistic missiles. The\nSoviets built, and Russia continues to maintain, the world's only\noperational anti-ballistic missile system. Additional programs\nfocused on the development of other ground- and space-based weapons\nusing laser, particle beam, and kinetic energy technology.\nhttp:\/\/www.nasm.si.edu\/exhibitions\/gal114\/SpaceRace\/sec600\/sec630.htm\n\n* Space Weapons in Development\n\nThe U.S. Space Command doesn't hide the fact that it wants to\nestablish U.S. supremacy in space. In its Vision for 2020 report, the\nSpace Command points out that military forces have always evolved to\nprotect national interests, both military and economic. The report\nsuggests that space weapons must be developed to protect U.S.\nsatellites, and other space vehicles, as other countries develop the\nability to launch spacecraft into space. In 1997, Assistant Secretary\nof the Air Force for Space, Keith R. Hall, said, \"With regard to\nspace dominance, we have it, we like it and we're going to keep it.\"\nThe Pentagon has said that as space enterprises begin to gain\ncommercial advantage, there will be those who try to take some of the\nprofits by attacking those space enterprises. Here are some of the\nspace weapons currently under development:\n\nChemical Lasers, Particle Beams, and Military Space Planes.\nThere are at least three laser systems being developed for either\nspace-based or ground-based weapons. All three are a type of chemical\nlaser that involves the mixing of chemicals inside the weapon to\ncreate a laser beam. While a space-based laser system is still about\n20 years from being realized, there are three lasers being considered\nfor it, including hydrogen fluoride (HF), deuterium fluoride (DF) and\nchemical oxygen iodine (COIL).\nhttp:\/\/science.howstuffworks.com\/space-war2.htm\n\n * Proton Gun\n(The business end of a mobile particle accelerator.)\n\nOkay, there are no such things as ghosts. However, there are weapons\nthat you might use to fight them; chief among these is the Proton Gun, a kind of particle-beam weapon, developed for the famous Ghostbusters. Particle-beam weapons are devices that accelerate subatomic particles or atoms to velocities near the speed of light,\nfocused into a narrow stream. The energy of the weapon is the aggregate kinetic energy of the individual particles forming the beam. A lightning bolt, a flow of electrons, is similar to a particle\nbeam. For those still keeping up with these weapons, there are two general types, classified by their use: charged particle-beam weapons (endoatmospheric use) and neutral particle-beam weapons (exoatmospheric use).\nhttp:\/\/technovelgy.com\/ct\/content.asp?Bnum=120\n\n* Personal Beam Weapons for GURPS\n\nThis pages lists numerous Beam Weapons developed using the rules in\nGURPS Vehicles, 2d. ed.
