2008-Tony Blair says that he will not step down 4 years after he said he would. A couple of months later he is assassinated. It is widely suspected that Gordon Brown was behind it but it is never proven even though 2 million pounds were missing from his bank account. He explained this by saying he had been gambling a lot. He is cleared and becomes prime minister.<br />
<br />
2009-Alqaeda hacks into ministry of defence computers and hack a missile. It is on collision course with the Houses of Parliament but the military get back in control and blow it up which destroys Big Ben and injures 30 people.<br />

Later that year the IRA including the political wing are arrested and the Good Friday agreement torn to pieces.<br />
A few IRA personnel escape and during the &quot;Summer of Terror&quot; 3000 innocent people are killed by bombs and gun fights.<br />
