								<div class="bbWrapper">I have read all three of the Nichols books about Montauk as well as Commnder X's about the Philadelphia Experiment. According to Nicholds there were coutless boys abducted FROM the area surrounding Montauk to be used as test subjects in the Montauk Experiments. Is there any credible information to corroborate these claims anywhere, that anyone is willing to share?

<br />
Also, I know that I was outside the Montauk light at least twice between the spring of 1959 and fall of 1960, and slept on the beach underneath the lighthouse one weekend. That was when I was between the ages of eight and nine. I recall nothing specifically being said in any of Nichols' books about the light itself being used as a part of the exeperiments as a transducer or tranciever of the time/space phase shifting energies that <br />
were alleged HAVING been created there, but it would make some sense since all sci-fi references to teleporter/transporter use modulated light energy in some form. <br />
<br />
Has there ever been documented humans that are gifted with natural phase shifting abiblities to partially to entirely move themeselves forwards and backwards through time and space without the aid of technology, both on this and other time lines? Is it conceivable that such a person triggered by the energies of the Montauk Project being in the close proximity thereof while the devices were in operation, could have been inadvertantly shifted inside the complex, but slightly out of phase with what was happening just enough to be unnoticed? <br />
<br />
Anyone have any comments or suggestitions? :devil: <br />
<br />
Curious about many things.<br />

Ok, cool! What is your opinion of such an individual HAVING been in the external proximity of such an experiment as Montauk, HAVING been inadvertantly shifted, or at least triggered INTO an constant ohase shifting/splitting mode?<br />
<br />
Have have you ever been in the immediate area of such time/space phase shifting tecdhnology activities, and if so what happened with you? I was in the vicinity of Montauk at least twice between spring 1959 and fall 1960 when I was eight and nine year old. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite9" alt=":eek:" title="Eek!    :eek:" />. When I years later read the Nichols &amp; Moon books about the Montauk experiments and saw those, now other alleged pictures of the innards of the site and some of the equipment, it gives me the creeps in deja vu, if you will.<br />
<br />
BTW, I cannot truthfully say where the name Zxavier came from, but I am persuaded it isn't imagined.<br />

Still digging,<br />

David Icke to present Saturday and Sunday!<br />
<br />
David Icke <br />
David Icke says&quot;When you are constantly moving forward, searching for the cutting edge, everyone behind you always believes you have gone too far. The further back FROM the cutting edge they are, the more extreme and, indeed, insane, you appear, to them, to be. In this way, one person's &quot;madness&quot; can be another person's commonsense. David's presentation picks up where talk radio leaves off! ORDER And the Truth Shall Set You Free, The Biggest Secret, and more FROM <a href="http://www.bridgeoflove.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">www.bridgeoflove.com</a><br />
<br />
Special 8 hour event, including the true background to September 11th, with David Icke. Part I on Saturday, part II continues on Sunday. <br />
<br />
Using hundreds of visuals, video footage, and lots of humor, David Icke will present more than ten years of research INTO the secret manipulation of the human race going back thousands of years with a detailed and extensive section about the real background to September 11th. <br />
Icke, the writer of ten books, including The Biggest Secret and the latest, Children of the Matrix, reveals how the same interbreeding bloodlines going back to ancient Sumer and Egypt continue to control the positions of power to this day as royalty, US presidents, banking and business leaders. <br />
His stunning information also exposes the subtle and less subtle methods of mass mind control which lead the human race like sheep in the direction the controlling few desire. This is leading to world government, world central bank and currency, a world army, and a microchipped population. This has long been predicted in his books and now is on the very brink of happening. <br />
Also included is suppressed information on humanity's ancient extraterrestrial origins - the origins of the bloodlines that continue to control the planet. No one who hears Icke speak will ever see the world in the same light again. davidicke.com<br />

'Mysterious Lights at Hessdalen, Norway'<br />
<br />
Emmy Award-winning TV producer, Earthfiles.com and radio investigative reporter and author, Linda Moulton Howe, will UPDATE her own August 2002 field research with an Italian and Norwegian team of scientists who are studying the mysterious lights that continually move in the Hessdalen Valley of Norway.

<br />
<br />
90-Workshop:<br />
'Latest News about Crop Formations, Animal Mutilations, Government Knowledge and Cover-Up'<br />
<br />
Emmy Award-winning TV producer, Earthfiles.com and radio investigative reporter and author, Linda Moulton Howe, will UPDATE her investigations with slides, videotapes, and audiotapes.<br />

<br />
Colin Andrews<br />
For nearly two decades Colin Andrews has traveled the world and appeared on numerous television programs in his efforts to communicate the mystery of crop circles to the general public. <br />
Because he is widely recognized as the world's foremost authority on the subject it came as a great shock to millions when he was seen on national television last year stating that only 20% of the crop circles researched during the years of 1999 and 2000 remained a mystery, inferring that the remaining 80% are man made! <br />
He has made numerous recent media appearances including with Sally Jesse Raphael, Art Bell and Dan Akroyd.<br />
<br />
45- Minute Lecture: Crop Circles Intro: Anyone who has studied this subject will know that in the past 24 months we have witnessed the most extraordinary crop circle patterns ever. In the last few months we have seen, and in upcoming months we will continue to see that &quot;someone&quot; has decided now is the time for the crop circles to be placed center stage. This free intro sets the groundwork for Colin's workshop, which promises to be one of his most riveting presentations ever!<br />
<br />
90- Minute Workshop: Crop Circles Intensive: Someone has decided that this is the year! Colin has worked as hard as anyone alive to convey the importance of the crop circle mystery. Most notably he has assisted Disney with the movie &quot;Signs&quot; (starring Mel Gibson) and a new British movie &quot; A Place To Stay&quot; for which he acted as chief consultant and appeared as himself in the movie. Rumors he has been bought off by the CIA or The Rockefeller's are simply not true, as you will find when you attend this workshop. Workshop will offer the latest slides and videos of the 2002 crop-circle season! cropcircleinfo.com<br />

Since 1996 Mr. Bassett has assisted a number of organizations and initiatives, which have been making the case for 1) an end to a government embargo on the truth surrounding an extraterrestrial presence and 2) the need for open congressional hearings for government witness testimony to UFO/ET events and evidence. <br />
He has spoken to millions of Americans about the likelihood and implications of a formal disclosure event. <a href="http://www.paradigmclock.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">www.paradigmclock.com</a>, <a href="http://www.x-ppac.org" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">www.x-ppac.org</a><br />

Shurlene &amp; Earlene<br />
Shurlene, born in Wichita, Kansas, now resides in Dallas, Texas. She holds an Associates of Arts Degree in Liberal Arts and a Bachelor's Degree in Human Resource Management. She embraces life and feels particularly grateful to have had such unique experience as the ones shared in her book. Her desire is to help others who struggle in silence with traumatic abduction experiences. Her twin sister Earlene is intimately linked to the phenomenon as well. She has maintained an incredible interest in the subject of UFO's and abduction stories since she was in grade school and maintains a large library on the subject. She has provided unwavering support to Shurlene and has helped unravel many of her experiences. They both believe that it is time our government exposes the truth about alien abductions and other cover-ups that exist where this phenomenon is concerned.<br />
<br />
<br />
45- Minute Lecture: FROM THE MOTHERLAND TO THE MOTHERSHIP<br />
Author, Shurlene B. Wallace, with her twin sister, Earlene Carr, discuss their new book, 'FROM THE MOTHERLAND TO THE MOTHERSHIP.' Shurlene will discuss their shared bond in this phenomenon as well as her experiences with various races of ET's. Their experiences include travel to different planets and interesting revelations. Earlene looks at the phenomenon FROM a cultural perspective. <br />
<br />
90- Minute Workshop:' MOTHERSHIP and MOTHERLAND'<br />
Mothership means nourishes, to hold close, provide shelter and teach. Many motherships exist as do many mothers. Motherships like mankind are well seeded. Motherland means origin, start of all life and civilization. The land nourishes cares for, honors and provides sustenance for life. The Motherland is sacred in origin. Therefore, these two words are powerful in conveying man's linkage to the stars. Honor Africa! Do not look at her as that which houses savages, but as a continent steeped in tradition and spirituality. Bring her back to her full glory and she will facilitate your linkage with the universe. Earlene shares a rich history of Africa and her oral traditions of alien visitations. Shurlene revels her personal path of spirituality, which facilitated her interaction with extraterrestrials. Attendee will be guided in defining their own personal path with the objective of achieving a greater understanding of their link to the cosmos. <br />
<br />
The twins share a song that they wrote which captures the phenomenon and man's expanding consciousness of his galactic heritage, titled, 'Galactic Hymn of Earth's Emergence'<br />

John Greenewald, Jr.<br />
John Greenewald, Jr. has been programming web sites and using computers since around 1992, when he was only eleven years old. Now, he is 21 years old, and for the past five and a half years, has been programming a web site (The Black Vault) which has not only caught the eye of the UFO community, but has caught the eye of international television audiences. John was born in Tarzana, California, April<br />
17, 1981 John's fascination with UFOs began at a very young age, with the love for comic books. 'Never seen a UFO, and have never had any type of experience,' says John, leaves him with a raging curiosity. Armed with the Freedom of Information Act, John slams the government with requests for information, which many they do not want to answer. Over the past four years, he has done hundred and hundreds, if not thousands of Freedom of Information Act requests to every corner of the government. The Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, countless offices in the Pentagon, all have been John's targets. John now works full time at home, on his websites, and growing his online business. Past employments include running an entire internet division, and coordinating and building extremely high traffic websites.<br />
<br />
45- Minute Lecture: Join John for his 45 minute lecture, he will explore the path he's taken for the past 5 1/2 years. Researching the UFO phenomenon. He will talk about just how he got started at the age of fifteen, and why. The road was long, the path was hard, but the end result was 100% irrefutable proof we are dealing with a phenomenon that is not only real, but a very big research subject of the U.S. Government.<br />
He will talk about &quot;The Black Vault&quot; site, and the community of over 20,000 members of that site! <br />
<br />
90- Minute Workshop: Join John for his 2-hour workshop, and he will take the lecture to the next level. He will dive deep inside the research he has taken in the past five and a half years. Detailing government agency by government agency, you will see the exact road he took to reasearch this phenomenon, and you will see exactly what evidence is truely there. See irrefutable evidence that the U.S. government is investigating this phenomenon is a heavily guarded, heavily Top Secret subject that the government DOES NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW!<br />

Budd Hopkins<br />
45- Minute Lecture: A BREAKTHROUGH ABDUCTION CASE WITH FULL MEDICAL EVIDENCE<br />
In March of this year a man with a history of UFO abduction experiences was taken to the emergency room of a New York area hospital, bleeding FROM three places in his body - including his bladder - after at least four hours of missing time. A later regression revealed the content of his harrowing abduction. What makes this case so uniquely important is that he received immediate medical attention and ongoing examinations of the anomalous injuries he suffered, and the involved doctors are so genuinely puzzled that they are instituting their own in-depth study of the phenomenon.. This is the first time that Budd Hopkins has been contacted by a GROUP of medical personnel to aid them in their investigation of an alleged UFO abduction.In his lecture he will detail his ongoing investigation of this this extraordinary case and will present several other similar cases he have dealt with which also involve bleeding FROM the bladder, apparently as a result of the aliens' invasive, quasi-medical procedures.<br />
You may learn more about Mr. Hopkins and his work at <a href="http://www.intrudersfoundation.org" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">www.intrudersfoundation.org</a><br />
<br />
90- Minute Workshop:ARE YOU AN ABDUCTEE?<br />
In this highly personal workshop we will examine many of the often subtle emotional, psychological and physical aftereffects of UFO abductions. Slides will be shown of the characteristic scars and marks associated with abductions, and a psychological profile of the typical abductee will be presented. Budd Hopkins will discuss the process of hypnosis and in demonstration an audio excerpt of a hypnotic session will be played. <br />
The central purpose of this workshop will be to aid those attending in deciding whether or not they, themselves, may have had a series of only partially recalled abduction experiences, and if so, what options exist for their exploration of these recollections. In his twenty-six years of working with over six hundred abductees, Hopkins is widely regarded as the most experienced abduction researcher<br />
in the world today, and much of his workshop will be devoted to a productive, therapeutic dialogue with the participants.<br />

Jim Marrs <br />
In 1989, Marrs book, Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy, was published to critical acclaim and became a basis for the Oliver Stone film JFK. In May, 1997, Marrs in-depth investigation of UFOs, Alien Agenda, was published by HarperCollins Publishers and in 2001 he published &quot;Psi Spies&quot; in a paperback form.

Mr. Marrs has appeared on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, CSPAN, The Discovery Channel, History Channel, This Morning America, Geraldo, Montell Williams, Today and The Larry King and Art Bell radio programs.<br />
<br />
45- Minute Lecture: RULE BY SECRECY: Award-winning journalist and New York Times Best-Selling author Jim Marrs brings together two heretofore unconnected concepts---Secret Societies and their control over our lives and the idea of Ancient Astronauts.<br />
<br />
As more and more archeological discoveries come to light, it becomes very clear that humankind's evolution has not been a slow advancement to our present state, but rather a slow and painful regaining of scientific knowledge following a &quot;fall&quot; FROM a great planet-wide, highly technological civilization in the distant past.<br />
<br />
Marrs connects the modern secret societies with the Ancient Mysteries of the past.<br />
<br />
<br />
90- Minute Workshop: THE WAR ON FREEDOM: This workshop will SHOW the connections between the agenda of the New World ORDER and the current War on Terrorism.<br />
<br />
America's first war of the 21st century has quickly bogged down in suspicions that the full underlying truth of the attacks of September 11, 2001, has not been presented to the public.<br />
<br />
The many serious questions concerning who was actually behind the dastardly attacks of 9-11 will be examined and the connections of those involved with secret societies with a global agenda will be examined as well as the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement. jimmarrs.com <br />

Jason Martell<br />
Jason's research first started 8 years ago where he became fascinated with possible artificial structures on Mars, and NASA's explanation for these objects. <br />
As well as the theory that there is another planet in our solar system, known as Planet X or the 12th planet. This planet is being actively search for by modern astronomers, because it does exist. The Sumerian culture, 6,000 years ago were also aware of this planet. And described a race of &quot;GODS&quot; that lived on that planet, and have visited us in our past. <br />
Jason Martell has given several lectures to MUFON about his research and appeared on many radio shows. Jason derives his information FROM a vast network of skilled researchers and sources, which can be accessed at xfacts.com<br />
<br />
45- Minute Lecture: The Search for Planet X <br />
Does NASA know about Planet X? <br />
Ancient Astronauts in our past? <br />
Will Planet X be returning soon? <br />
<br />
The 6,000 year old Sumerian descriptions of our solar system include one more planet they called &quot;Nibiru&quot;, which means &quot;Planet of the crossing&quot;. The descriptions of this planet by the Sumerians match precisely the specifications of &quot;Planet X&quot; (the Tenth Planet), which is currently being sought by modern astronomers in the depths of our Solar System. <br />
The Sumerians state that PLANET X, (Nibiru), collided with our primitive Earth in the past, creating the asteroid belt and forever becoming another member of our solar system in a comet like 3,600 year orbit around the sun. The technology we have today allows us to view events described by the ancients in a new perspective.<br />
<br />
90- Minute Workshop: Modern Science confirms Ancient Knowledge <br />
Will Planet X return in 2003? <br />
Has Planet X passed by Earth in the past? <br />
NASA and Planet X? <br />
<br />
The writing of the Ancient Near East include a profusion of astronomical texts that clearly speak of a planet FROM which Ancient Astronauts or &quot;GODS&quot; had come from. However, when scholars 150 years ago deciphered and translated the ancient texts, our astronomers were not yet aware of Pluto which was only located in 1930. How could they be expected to accept the evidence of yet one more planet in our solar system? <br />
But now that we too, like the ancients, are aware of the planets beyond Saturn, why not accept the ancient evidence that there is a 10th planet in our solar system? <br />
As we ourselves venture INTO space, a fresh new look and acceptance of the ancient scriptures is more than timely. Now that astronauts have landed on the Moon and unmanned space craft explore the outer planets, it is no longer impossible to believe that a civilization on another planet more advanced than ours was capable of landing its astronauts on the planet Earth in the past... <br />

45- Minute Lecture: UFO's: The Giant Rock Story, First Contact. <br />
It was through his extraterrestrial sources that Bob was told of a location in the high desert of Southern California. These 'sources' led him to a gravelly, dirt roadway, and ultimately to the home of Mr. and Mrs. George Van Tassel, who own &amp; manage the airport called Giant Rock - where the first well-known and very large Flying Saucer Conventions took place. <br />
Many speakers at this event claimed actual physical contact with extraterrestrials, and Bob was no exception. His extraterrestrial contacts continue to this dayâ€¦<br />
This lecture will include many slides of the early days of ufology- don't miss it! <br />
The history of this particular area is one of the cornerstones of the UFO phenomenon.<br />
<br />
<br />
90- Minute Workshop: Giant Rock and Beyond. <br />
<br />
After the early years in which Bob was involved in early ham radio &quot;contacts,&quot; and FROM that to developing communication with extraterrestrial sources Short was led to the location of the Giant Rock Airport where he experienced more contacts. It was also during this period that he had his first physical contact. This was soon followed by several close encounters in which Bob and his family were involved. They were also privileged to see demonstrations of various spacecrafts in many different locations. Bob is now based in Arizona and his UFO encounters and space source communications are in their 50th year. <br />

First, this was forwarded to me by <a href="http://www.ufo.org/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ufo.org/</a> or <a href="http://www.earthfriendly.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.earthfriendly.com</a> , and I feel if you have a local Teslan in your area, you should try to consult with him/her, as this type of territory is mainly alien, excuse the pun, for most to understand, as what I am about to impart to you has been known by more than 300,000 plus Teslans. To start this &quot;turn of the century&quot; ( 1900 ) journey, you must go back to that time to help you form the proper decision about what is about to be given to you as wisdom only known by &quot;true&quot; Teslans and the Defense Intellegance Agency, ie. the DIA ( the real &quot;Men In Black&quot;, ie. the MIB, and dispite what the movies have presented to the public, these are not &quot;nice people&quot;, as they will kill you if you some how interfere with their &quot;lawless&quot; agenda. Next, I have been a student of our lost mentor Nicola Tesla for more than 30 years, and a member of the International Tesla Society ( Colorado Springs, Colorado ) and once a member of MUFON, when I was younger and more foolish in my youth, and quit for health reasons, I strangely decided I would like to live a little bit longer, as most of us at some time meet our &quot;friendly&quot; ( NOT ) MIBs.<br />

So, here is our tail of scientific superior technologies, hundreds of years a head of our 21ST Century, with the greats inventor of our time, and I am not talking about Edison, I refer to Tesla, as he had ore than a 1000 patents, greater than Edison, who criminal stealing of Tesla's historical legecy of the invention of &quot;Electricity&quot; ( AC ), which has never been corrected to this day in the history books, by science or the MEDIA, and Tesla also invent &quot;Radio&quot; ( CW, RF, etc. ) not Marconi, another theif of history. Further, the reason I am giving you this &quot;history lesson&quot; is to SHOW how things and facts can be twisted, to cover-up or obsure those that would try to help &quot;humankind&quot;, and either end up dead, or discredited.<br />
 <br />
So, to answer questions today about the two Teslan projects, done by both the military and the &quot;Black Programs&quot; require a finess, only Teslan can generate, as these subjects are very complicated for the &quot;general public&quot; to understand and a great deal of scientist, who are just now beginning to comprehend who and what Tesla was and represents today in all levels of science.<br />
 <br />
Five years ago, I worked at the first Nanotechnologies corporation, at NASA, Johnson Space Center or JSC, as we call it ( home of the astronauts ), Clear lake, Texas, the Nano-Tech Research and Development Corporation ( Inc, IPO ) to help a friend of mine produce a method of manufacturing a new type of optical transistor, the Fogal &quot;Charge Barrier&quot; ( or Blocking, as Berden states ) Transistor, ie. CBT, <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~ghawk/fogal_device/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.eskimo.com/~ghawk/fogal_device/</a>. Bill has been my friend ( adopted brother and a &quot;Pain in the Ass&quot; ) and partner since 1994, and so much so he sold me one of his very powerful original six &quot;first prototype&quot; transistors, of which I have conducted thousands of experiments, based on his &quot;Pumped Phase Conjugate&quot; ( Mirror ) or PPCM optical concept, that lead to new communication technologies, not based on Electro Magnetics, ie.EM, but Teslan longitudinal Gravitonic Scalar Bi~wave. <br />
 <br />
Such that Bill had worked with Boeing and explained how his CBT could be used to elliminate EM &quot;noise&quot; in their 777 jets, and that he could also dramatically decrease their fuel consumption, by using the CBT to create , as I call it, &quot;Hydrogen nuecli&quot; anti-drag, and NASA and Boeing are bot looking in commiting funds ( Nasa, $ 600,000, and possible a Billion dollars by Boeing, if they can get it to work ( but they are going to fail, as they are using &quot;Super Conductivity&quot; to accomplish &quot;Anti-Gravity&quot; or &quot;Propulsionless Propulsion&quot; as the idiots at NASA call it, they are a fraid to you the big &quot;A-G&quot; ) and if it does not &quot;blow-up&quot; on the or worse, as they do not know what they are experimenting with.<a href="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm</a> <br />
 <br />
Therefore, they are starting to delve, even though they have no idea what they are doing, as Teslans have been working on these concepts for almost a hundred years hence, and this now gets back to the totally mis-understood &quot; Montauk Project / Philadelhia Experiment&quot; such as to have skewed Tesla's original involvement, his four &quot;field coil&quot; generators ( Einstein/TESLA/Gravitonic ) on the U.S.S.Eldridge at the Philadelphia Naval &quot;proving grounds&quot;, which lead to the Montauk Project which lead to the possible controlling Space/Time ( 4th dimension ), mainly time, as the CBT has proven with test at NASA at JPL, Dr. Greg Hodewanek and Bill Ramsey, who has been experimenting with &quot;Inter-phase&quot; the original problem that had un-expectively developed during the final phase of the &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot;. <br />
 <br />
Which was to produce &quot;sky to water&quot; ( Blue ) invisibility, which did work intially, but but went horroribly wrong, possibly FROM mis-calculation, as they believed that they had bent light only but in fact had created a Space/Time distortion ( Gravity Scalar Wave ), brought on by their elemental understanding of Einstein's &quot;Theory of Relativity&quot; or his &quot;Special Relativity&quot; Theory, based on Gravitonics,as the graviton is not just one particle, a photon )( or Quanta ) but has a duality counter-part, a anti-photon ( or phonon, such as Fogal's CBT possesses ), such as matter has anti-matter, or to produce &quot;super conductivity&quot; requires, theoritically &quot;Cooper pairing&quot;, as the universal constant, as Greg has stated exsist as &quot;Steady State&quot; Physics shows, there is no &quot;Big Bang&quot;, sorry Hawkins, an Kiku ( &quot;String Theory&quot; ). <br />
 <br />
Our numerous experiments has simply proven them wrong, with PPCM imperical proof, and the experiments with &quot;Wave Probagation&quot;, proving that SETI is a big &quot;cosmic joke&quot; on both NASA and the US taxpayer ( it is now owned by MS Bill Gates and Paul Allen, now the &quot;Pheonix Project&quot; and SETI@Home ) as any advanced alien civilization, older than 500 to 1000 years would be using &quot;Gravity Bi~Wave&quot; to talk amongst the Stars, and these aliens would give their children the lesser &quot;low band&quot;, in the EM Hydrogen frequency, as we do with our children, crystal radios, CB, etc.<br />
 <br />
So if ET is out there he is not going to wait 200 years, or greater, between transmit and recieve ( 400 years ) to say &quot;hello&quot; and then &quot;Goodbye&quot;, as we are dealing with the speed of light ( 186,342.01 miles per sec or 300,000 meters per sec. ) and with that probagation you would not have much of a conversation, with ET, but Fogal's type of &quot;Phase Conjugate&quot; technology ( there is the Aspen device, also ) which, uniqually has no probagation ( 3d Space/Time ) delay, as we have demonstrated to both NASA and the military ( Augusta-Tech meeting, and I was there ) so they have known about this concept, but have never totally understood this Teslan function, PPCM.<br />
 <br />
Last, this was the &quot;Montauk Project&quot;, as I had said the result of the &quot;Philadelhia Experiment&quot; lesson, finally learned, with great harm to the Eldridge naval crew, our usual practice, like the atomic bomb exposure to our miltary, so what else is new, so what if those sailors got stuck in the bulkheads, its all for science sake, and if it drove the rest crazy, that is ok, they are only sailors, ya right.....<br />
 <br />
If, you desire to continue, I will be glad to respond, but remember, the Internet has cyber eyes and ears ( FBI &quot; the dreaded &quot;C&quot; ) also you may find extra information at the <a href="http://fbi.gov/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://fbi.gov/</a> and look in their archieve under Tesla, they just released about 6 Meg Bytes of confiscated documents, released by the &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot;, so called &quot;Open Records&quot; Act.<br />

 <br />
First, this was forwarded to me by <a href="http://www.ufo.org/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ufo.org/</a> or <a href="http://www.earthfriendly.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.earthfriendly.com</a> , and I feel if you have a local Teslan in your area, you should try to consult with him/her, as this type of territory is mainly alien, <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, let us park here. <br />
 1. First, what is a Teslan?<br />
 2. How would Go about locating such an one? <br />
 3. Alien, such as life forms other than EH-1's??<br />
<br />
excuse the pun, for most to understand, as what I am about to impart to you has been known by more than 300,000 plus Teslans. <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are the Teslans any relations to the Maealeans??<br />
 <br />
To start this &quot;turn of the century&quot; ( 1900 ) journey, you must go back to that time to help you form the proper decision about what is about to be given to you as wisdom only known by &quot;true&quot; Teslans and the Defense Intellegance Agency, ie. the DIA ( the real &quot;Men In Black&quot;, ie. the MIB, and dispite what the movies have presented to the public, these are not &quot;nice people&quot;, as they will kill you if you some how interfere with their &quot;lawless&quot; agenda. Next,<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have heard only sketchy things about the clandestine protectors of the most 'secret' things in the government. I am aware that I have been under some for of surveillance for most of my adult life. In recent days, several different hellicopters and an occasional fixed-wing aircraft fly within electronic viewing distance, several close enough to be sniped at or by with conventional pea shooter weaponry. Could this be as a result of the serious digging I am in forbidden areas of understanding?<br />
<br />
 I have been a student of our lost mentor Nicola Tesla for more than 30 years, and a member of the International Tesla Society ( Colorado Springs, Colorado ) and once a member of MUFON, when I was younger and more foolish in my youth, and quit for health reasons, I strangely decided I would like to live a little bit longer, as most of us at some time meet our &quot;friendly&quot; ( NOT ) MIBs.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you know if there are any Teslans or members of MUFON in the state of SC? How about MIB activity. The old Donaldson Air Base, AKA Greenvile Air Force Base here, which has officially has been closed since the 1950's is still often visited by numerous government planes supposedly to be retrofitted for other uses by the civilian cotractor that is at the industrial park now on that site, but I lived right in the glide path of that place for over 2 years and noticed many unmarked aircraft, including military appearing copters, frequenting that refuge . . . have you any information about that?<br />
 <br />
So, here is our tail of scientific superior technologies, hundreds of years a head of our 21ST Century, with the greatest inventor of our time, and I am not talking about Edison, I refer to Tesla, as he had ore than a 1000 patents, greater than Edison, who criminal stealing of Tesla's historical legecy of the invention of &quot;Electricity&quot; ( AC ), which has never been corrected to this day in the history books, by science or the MEDIA, and Tesla also invent &quot;Radio&quot; ( CW, RF, etc. ) not Marconi, another theif of history. Further, the reason I am giving you this &quot;history lesson&quot; is to SHOW how things and facts can be twisted, to cover-up or obsure those that would try to help &quot;humankind&quot;, and either end up dead, or discredited.<br />
 <br />
So, to answer questions today about the two Teslan projects, done by both the military and the &quot;Black Programs&quot; require a finess, only Teslan can generate, as these subjects are very complicated for the &quot;general public&quot; to understand and a great deal of scientist, who are just now beginning to comprehend who and what Tesla was and represents today in all levels of science.<br />
 <br />
Five years ago, I worked at the first Nanotechnologies corporation, at NASA, Johnson Space Center or JSC, as we call it ( home of the astronauts ), Clear lake, Texas, the Nano-Tech Research and Development Corporation ( Inc, IPO ) to help a friend of mine produce a method of manufacturing a new type of optical transistor, the Fogal &quot;Charge Barrier&quot; ( or Blocking, as Berden states ) Transistor, ie.

Bill has been my friend ( adopted brother and a &quot;Pain in the Ass&quot; ) and partner since 1994, and so much so he sold me one of his very powerful original six &quot;first prototype&quot; transistors, of which I have conducted thousands of experiments, based on his &quot;Pumped Phase Conjugate&quot; ( Mirror ) or PPCM optical concept, that lead to new communication technologies, not based on Electro Magnetics, <br />
ie.EM, but Teslan longitudinal Gravitonic Scalar Bi~wave. <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that I have never studied anything about these transistor technologies, and yet as with some of the theorectical physics I am curretnly studying in the book &quot;Hyperspace,&quot; some of that material was very familiar, as though somewhere I had seen it before . . . when I read your note the first time for content, it wasn't entirely strange to me.. <br />
Such that Bill had worked with Boeing and explained how his CBT could be used to elliminate EM &quot;noise&quot; in their 777 jets, and that he could also dramatically decrease their fuel consumption, by using the CBT to create , as I call it, &quot;Hydrogen nuecli&quot; anti-drag, and NASA and Boeing are both looking in commiting funds ( Nasa, $ 600,000, and possible a Billion dollars by Boeing, if they can get it to work ( but they are going to fail, as they are using &quot;Super Conductivity&quot; to accomplish &quot;Anti-Gravity&quot; or &quot;Propulsionless Propulsion&quot; as the idiots at NASA call it, they are afraid to you the big &quot;A-G&quot; ) and if it does not &quot;blow-up&quot; on the or worse, as they do not know what they are experimenting with.<a href="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm</a> <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chuckle <br />
 <br />
Therefore, they are starting to delve, even though they have no idea what they are doing, as Teslans have been working on these concepts for almost a hundred years hence, <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been absolutely persuaded for over ten years, that the technology that has billed as fictional in space sci-fi, paramilitary, law enforcement and spy vs spy<br />
for at least three quarters of a century has been either real and functional in some rudimentary form at the time, and / or real in the future that has been sent back in the form of historical abstracts to be shown in media fiction as a stark warning of what to expect in the future if we don't get straight. How far off base am I with these wild specilations of mine&gt;?<br />
<br />
and this now gets back to the totally mis-understood &quot; Montauk Project / Philadelhia Experiment&quot; such as to have skewed Tesla's original involvement, his four &quot;field coil&quot; generators ( Einstein/TESLA/Gravitonic ) on the U.S.S.Eldridge at the Philadelphia Naval &quot;proving grounds&quot;, which lead to the Montauk Project which lead to the possible controlling Space/Time ( 4th dimension ), mainly time, as the CBT has proven with test at NASA at JPL, Dr. Greg Hodewanek and Bill Ramsey, who has been experimenting with &quot;Inter-phase&quot; the original problem that had un-expectively developed during the final phase of the &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot;. <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you tell me, what exactly did happen at Montauk? I have read three of the Nichols and Moon books in the past. My concern is that I know I was at least Montauk near the light twice between the spring of 1959 and the fall of 1960 as an eight and nine year old. I believe that I am one who is gifted with natural phase shifting abilities and these may have been maleffected by my being in the close proximity of such a powerful phase shifting rf field. Was the Montauk Light ever a part of these experiments as a transducer/traceiver in modulated light experiments?<br />
Which was to produce &quot;sky to water&quot; ( Blue ) invisibility, which did work intially, but but went horroribly wrong, possibly FROM mis-calculation, as they believed that they had bent light only but in fact had created a Space/Time distortion ( Gravity Scalar Wave ), brought on by their elemental understanding of Einstein's &quot;Theory of Relativity&quot; or his &quot;Special Relativity&quot; Theory, based on Gravitonics,as the graviton is not just one particle, a photon )( or Quanta ) but has a duality counter-part, a anti-photon ( or phonon, such as Fogal's CBT possesses ), such as matter has anti-matter, or to produce &quot;super conductivity&quot; requires, theoritically &quot;Cooper pairing&quot;, as the universal constant, as Greg has stated exsist as &quot;Steady State&quot; Physics shows, there is no &quot;Big Bang&quot;, sorry Hawkins, an Kiku ( &quot;String Theory&quot; ). <br />
 <br />
Our numerous experiments has simply proven them wrong, with PPCM imperical proof, and the experiments with &quot;Wave Probagation&quot;, proving that SETI is a big &quot;cosmic joke&quot; on both NASA and the US taxpayer ( it is now owned by MS Bill Gates and Paul Allen, now the &quot;Pheonix Project&quot; and SETI@Home ) as any advanced alien civilization, older than 500 to 1000 years would be using &quot;Gravity Bi~Wave&quot; to talk amongst the Stars, and these aliens would give their children the lesser &quot;low band&quot;, in the EM Hydrogen frequency, as we do with our children, crystal radios, CB, etc.<br />
 <br />
So if ET is out there he is not going to wait 200 years, or greater, between transmit and recieve ( 400 years ) to say &quot;hello&quot; and then &quot;Goodbye&quot;, as we are dealing with the speed of light ( 186,342.01 miles per sec or 300,000 meters per sec. ) and with that probagation you would not have much of a conversation, with ET, but Fogal's type of &quot;Phase Conjugate&quot; technology ( there is the Aspen device, also ) which, uniqually has no probagation ( 3d Space/Time ) delay, as we have demonstrated to both NASA and the military ( Augusta-Tech meeting, and I was there ) so they have known about this concept, but have never totally understood this Teslan function, PPCM.<br />
 <br />
Last, this was the &quot;Montauk Project&quot;, as I had said the result of the &quot;Philadelhia Experiment&quot; lesson, finally learned, with great harm to the Eldridge naval crew, our usual practice, like the atomic bomb exposure to our miltary, so what else is new, so what if those sailors got stuck in the bulkheads, its all for science sake, and if it drove the rest crazy, that is ok, they are only sailors, ya right.....<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Was that a fact? Is there credible and verifiable documentation to corroborate that and anything that is published about either Philadelphia or Montauk?<br />
 <br />
If, you desire to continue, I will be glad to respond, but remember, the Internet has cyber eyes and ears ( FBI &quot; the dreaded &quot;C&quot; ) also you may find extra information at the <a href="http://fbi.gov/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://fbi.gov/</a> and look in their archieve under Tesla, they just released about 6 Meg Bytes of confiscated documents, released by the &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot;, so called &quot;Open Records&quot; Act.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; No doubt I have been marked already, especially if, as I suspect there is some direct connection between some of my current distresses and any of these previous &quot;never happened&quot; covert operations.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Another question for you to. In my browsing countless pages on the www about Montauk and other related topics, it was suggested that the hundreds of cell phone transmission and relay towers that are see envery, but like sentinels in the scores around every major city in North America, alre also a part of the ongoing mind control efforts of either the government or other rogue organizations and agencies. Can you enlighten at all on this topic. I have had rigning in my ears since I was about nine year of age, which has been accredited to an ear injury where one of my ear drums was punctured by aloud noise. In recent days since I have been digging INTO these things, the rigning is becoming louder, and occasionally even overbearing such as accoustic feedback, and this has happened several times in the past 10 -12 years under certain situations.<br />

I will glqadly entertain further discussioins with you or anyone else who will offer more that pe5rsonal opions and biases against others with real interest in pursuing realtime information about these things as I am finding in one of the forums I am following about Montauk. I have notices that only one individual has replied to any of the posts I have made at the Time Travel Institute forums under the new thread I began in the Montauk/PX discussion last week.<br />

 <br />
~And I will use my &quot;old power name&quot; in the Hyper~Hacking community ( 2600C ), the HyTDRA Hacker <br />
 <br />
First, this was forwarded to me by <a href="http://www.ufo.org/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ufo.org/</a> or <a href="http://www.earthfriendly.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.earthfriendly.com</a> , and I feel if you have a local Teslan in your area, you should try to consult with him/her, as this type of territory is mainly alien, <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, let us park here. <br />
 1. First, what is a Teslan?<br />
~A follower of Nicola Tesla ( professional knowledge ) and we are not aliens, but &quot;good human beings&quot; <br />
 2. How would Go about locating such an one?<br />
~A follower of Nicola Tesla can not be found in the telephone directories, unless you look under Electrical Engineer, ie. EE, as I am, most, an EE knows of Tesla's invention of AC power ( not Edison ) and his dynomos at Niagra Falls power station ( the Nigra Grid, as we call it ). <br />
 3. Alien, such as life forms other than EH-1's??<br />
~And again, we are not aliens, but &quot;good human beings&quot;, train in the &quot;Teslan way&quot;.<br />
excuse the pun, for most to understand, as what I am about to impart to you has been known by more than 300,000 plus Teslans. <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are the Teslans any relations to the Maealeans??<br />
~And once again, we are not aliens, but &quot;good human beings&quot;, trained to help humankind and do no harm to it with our or other science, like NanoTechnologies ( My E.I.N.S.T.E.I.N. Project blogger on my web site ) a credo we take very serious, following the mandate set down by Tesla himself..........&quot;help humankind and do no harm to it with our or other science&quot;, paraphrased...<br />
 <br />
To start this &quot;turn of the century&quot; ( 1900 ) journey, you must go back to that time to help you form the proper decision about what is about to be given to you as wisdom only known by &quot;true&quot; Teslans and the Defense Intellegance Agency, ie. the DIA ( the real &quot;Men In Black&quot;, ie. the MIB, and dispite what the movies have presented to the public, these are not &quot;nice people&quot;, as they will kill you if you some how interfere with their &quot;lawless&quot; agenda. Next,<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have heard only sketchy things about the clandestine protectors of the most 'secret' things in the government. I am aware that I have been under some for of surveillance for most of my adult life. In recent days, several different hellicopters and an occasional fixed-wing aircraft fly within electronic viewing distance, several close enough to be sniped at or by with conventional pea shooter weaponry. Could this be as a result of the serious digging I am in forbidden areas of understanding?<br />
~ Once apon a time, in a far off galaxy, our galaxy ( not Star Wars tm ) on a small planet called Terra ( Earth ) soon to be &quot;evil men&quot; took charge of the third planet in our solar system in the 1950s.....<br />
I started this way to make a point, we are not dealing in Sci-Fi here, people and scientist have been killed by the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; ( and I am not talking about the old USSR )....First it was President Isenhower's GROUP known as Majestic 12 ( now it is Majestic 13 ) or MJ12 as it has gotten abrievated by the military ( their normal practice ) and UFOers which originally had a possible good agenda but &quot;Wealthy evil&quot; types took over the original agenda, and caused a split, now &quot;GOOD&quot; and &quot;EVIL&quot; now ran our planet.....So, there has been a constant war to control Earth, the &quot;Good Guys&quot; Teslans, the &quot;Bad Guys&quot;, the &quot;Illuninati&quot; ( MJ12 or now MJ13 ) we are soon going to go to War ( and I am not talking about Iraq ), and the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; know they have lost, and will soon be defeated by the Teslans, as we possess hyper superior technology ( Fogal's Transistor is a toy ) when Illuminati finally raises their head, we Teslans will cut it off. ....Over 300,000 Teslans went under ground 3 years ago ( I have not been able to get in touch with them to join the fight, said to say ), to prepare for this soon historical making event, we will elliminate all who have united with them, in the most painful way we have at our disposal, to make an example of them to all future tyrrants, that we will always win......<br />
 <br />
~Now, to your surveillance, it is well known that those who come in contact purposely or accidentally are placed under monitoring, as I was told by &quot;Condor&quot; my CIA/NSA/DIA contact many years ago, sorry can not use his real name as he is still active, I worked with him in the 1980s to solve the bugging ( listenning devices ) in the Russian built American Embassy, and found the solution to neutrialize those numerous bugs, but the government did not use it.....Know the &quot;ring in your ears&quot; could have been a projected monitoring or possibly an implaint, when you were younger or at birth, that may have malfunctioned because of the intense EM you were exposed to, if you had any direct exposure to the &quot;Light&quot; ( Temporal Phasing of photons ) of both the &quot;Montauk Project / Philadelphia Experiment&quot; now advancing to more complex experimentation, as a resent EMP event had demonstrated in 2000-1, &quot;frying birds&quot;, blowing power out, and knocking out a Radio Station, in those regions known for such experiments ( your area, Ky, Tn, SC, NC, etc. ), so you are not the only one who may have been exposed, and probably won't be the last, if our &quot;mad men&quot; have their way........Below is a non &quot;Black Program&quot; Tokamak EM torroidal heating device, and if they can build this monstrocity, you can image what the &quot;Black Programmer&quot; could build back 50 years ago....what do you thing, ha....possibly nano tech, or at least micro-tech........remember the Transistor was developed in the 1950s ( Tesla concept ).... <br />
 Could this be the New concept Tocamak, size wise?<br />
 I have been a student of our lost mentor Nicola Tesla for more than 30 years, and a member of the International Tesla Society ( Colorado Springs, Colorado ) and once a member of MUFON, when I was younger and more foolish in my youth, and quit for health reasons, I strangely decided I would like to live a little bit longer, as most of us at some time meet our &quot;friendly&quot; ( NOT ) MIBs.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you know if there are any Teslans or members of MUFON in the state of SC?<br />
~Look up a Electrical Engineer, ie. EE, at one of your colleges or universities ( possible the teacher at a two year colledge ) USC.......<br />
 How about MIB activity. The old Donaldson Air Base, AKA Greenvile Air Force Base here, which has officially has been closed since the 1950's is still often visited by numerous government planes supposedly to be retrofitted for other uses by the civilian cotractor that is at the industrial park now on that site, but I lived right in the glide path of that place for over 2 years and noticed many unmarked aircraft, including military appearing copters, frequenting that refuge . . . have you any information about that?<br />
~Black Birds ( U-2, SR-71, now the Arora ), developed by the &quot;Skunk Works&quot; are obviously primitive craft compare to what true &quot;black projects&quot; possess, however, the popular choice of today is the &quot;Black Hawk&quot; Heliocopter, or something like the &quot;preditor&quot;, and the CIA at the old air base they hanger in Arizona, next to our old office HQ got bored and gave my corporate's president ( he is a pilot, &quot;birds of a feather flock together&quot; ) who graduated FROM Emery was shown the guts of the &quot;Black Bird&quot; chopper, the &quot;Long Bow&quot; over the horizon radar, top secret, ya, read Janes Journal.....and further they do use old &quot;so-called&quot; abandon <br />
military bases, of one is yours, as we had the Arora engine test by a &quot;so-called&quot; secret base in our Texas &quot;Big Thicket&quot; State Park, which injured and finally killed the people ( two, with one still serviving, barely )<br />
 who had been exposed to it's high intense nuclear scram jet pulses, with the results of both severe radiation burns ( also burned the paint off of these 3 victims' car ) cancer later, ten years ago. It would have been covered up, except for a well trained doctor who had seen radiation burns before, as our local media reported it.<br />
So, here is our tail of scientific superior technologies, hundreds of years a head of our 21ST Century, with the greatest inventor of our time, and I am not talking about Edison, I refer to Tesla, as he had ore than a 1000 patents, greater than Edison, who criminal stealing of Tesla's historical legecy of the invention of &quot;Electricity&quot; ( AC ), which has never been corrected to this day in the history books, by science or the MEDIA, and Tesla also invent &quot;Radio&quot; ( CW, RF, etc. ) not Marconi, another theif of history. Further, the reason I am giving you this &quot;history lesson&quot; is to SHOW how things and facts can be twisted, to cover-up or obsure those that would try to help &quot;humankind&quot;, and either end up dead, or discredited.<br />
 <br />
So, to answer questions today about the two Teslan projects, done by both the military and the &quot;Black Programs&quot; require a finess, only Teslan can generate, as these subjects are very complicated for the &quot;general public&quot; to understand and a great deal of scientist, who are just now beginning to comprehend who and what Tesla was and represents today in all levels of science.<br />
 <br />
Five years ago, I worked at the first Nanotechnologies corporation, at NASA, Johnson Space Center or JSC, as we call it ( home of the astronauts ), Clear lake, Texas, the Nano-Tech Research and Development Corporation ( Inc, IPO ) to help a friend of mine produce a method of manufacturing a new type of optical transistor, the Fogal &quot;Charge Barrier&quot; ( or Blocking, as Berden states ) Transistor, ie. CBT, <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~ghawk/fogal_device/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.eskimo.com/~ghawk/fogal_device/</a>. Bill has been my friend ( adopted brother and a &quot;Pain in the Ass&quot; ) and partner since 1994, and so much so he sold me one of his very powerful original six &quot;first prototype&quot; transistors, of which I have conducted thousands of experiments, based on his &quot;Pumped Phase Conjugate&quot; ( Mirror ) or PPCM optical concept, that lead to new communication technologies, not based on Electro Magnetics, ie.EM, but Teslan longitudinal Gravitonic Scalar Bi~wave. &gt;&gt;&gt; I know that I have never studied anything about these transistor technologies, and yet as with some of the theorectical physics I am curretnly studying in the book &quot;Hyperspace,&quot; some of that material was very familiar, as though somewhere I had seen it before . . . when I read your note the first time for content, it wasn't entirely strange to me.. <br />
~How and if I can EXPLAIN Bill's CB Transistor is both difficult and timely, however it has taken be almost every bit of six years to understand the rutimtary concepts just to make it work and produce a product, mainly Bill's fault, as he promised me a second CBT, but to this day I have but one ( powerful though ) to do my research, as Tom Berden has had four CBTs to my one, but that has not slowed me down in my experimentation one bit, I just simply found replacement technology to do some of Fogal's CBT functions.........But I do get mad at Bill some time, as he has cost me and my partner about $ 100,000 in cost.......and he still to this day has not produced new CBT units.......which Bill has promised me for years, as I taught him about Holo~graphic video, as he only new about Holo~graphic audio.......So I have accomplished it with a mix of different technologies fron different fields of science, mathematics, chaos ( Analog noise cancellation ) <a href="http://chaotic.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://chaotic.com</a> , Holographics ( my own VR research, ALLH ) <a href="http://holoteslab.net/index4.html" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://holoteslab.net/index4.html</a> , Nano~Tech ( NASA, JSC, Clear Lake, Texas ), and &quot;Blue to Ultra~Violet&quot; LEDS and Laser diodes ( PPCM ) and a number of bits and pieces FROM Vulcunology ( Gravitonic Wave Patterns )........<br />
Such that Bill had worked with Boeing and explained how his CBT could be used to elliminate EM &quot;noise&quot; in their 777 jets, and that he could also dramatically decrease their fuel consumption, by using the CBT to create , as I call it, &quot;Hydrogen nuecli&quot; anti-drag, and NASA and Boeing are both looking in commiting funds ( Nasa, $ 600,000, and possible a Billion dollars by Boeing, if they can get it to work ( but they are going to fail, as they are using &quot;Super Conductivity&quot; to accomplish &quot;Anti-Gravity&quot; or &quot;Propulsionless Propulsion&quot; as the idiots at NASA call it, they are afraid to you the big &quot;A-G&quot; ) and if it does not &quot;blow-up&quot; on the or worse, as they do not know what they are experimenting with.<a href="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm</a> <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chuckle <br />
~ agree, LOL........<br />
 <br />
Therefore, they are starting to delve, even though they have no idea what they are doing, as Teslans have been working on these concepts for almost a hundred years hence, <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been absolutely persuaded for over ten years, that the technology that has billed as fictional in space sci-fi, paramilitary, law enforcement and spy vs spy<br />
for at least three quarters of a century has been either real and functional in some rudimentary form at the time, and / or real in the future that has been sent back in the form of historical abstracts to be shown in media fiction as a stark warning of what to expect in the future if we don't get straight. How far off base am I with these wild specilations of mine&gt;?<br />
~Right on the money, sad to say.......<br />
and this now gets back to the totally mis-understood &quot; Montauk Project / Philadelhia Experiment&quot; such as to have skewed Tesla's original involvement, his four &quot;field coil&quot; generators ( Einstein/TESLA/Gravitonic ) on the U.S.S.Eldridge at the Philadelphia Naval &quot;proving grounds&quot;, which lead to the Montauk Project which lead to the possible controlling Space/Time ( 4th dimension ), mainly time, as the CBT has proven with test at NASA at JPL, Dr. Greg Hodewanek and Bill Ramsey, who has been experimenting with &quot;Inter-phase&quot; the original problem that had un-expectively developed during the final phase of the &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot;. <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you tell me, what exactly did happen at Montauk? I have read three of the Nichols and Moon books in the past. My concern is that I know I was at least Montauk near the light twice between the spring of 1959 and the fall of 1960 as an eight and nine year old. I believe that I am one who is gifted with natural phase shifting abilities and these may have been maleffected by my being in the close proximity of such a powerful phase shifting rf field. Was the Montauk Light ever a part of these experiments as a transducer/traceiver in modulated light experiments?<br />
~That is a very long story, as only &quot;bits and piece&quot; sometime have &quot;sneaked out&quot;, but it is rare to get the <br />
&quot;whole story&quot; in one shot, so you will have to take my word on what I am about to tell you, and you can take it with a &quot;grain of salt&quot;, or &quot;ton of salt&quot; but a lot of what I know came FROM reliable sources over the years, NASA meetings, Tesla meeting, contacts in the scientific and military communities......I had a conversation in 1982, at the Nationional Computer Conference, ie. NCC ( like Comdex, but world, very big....) and met a EE who was exploring the possiblity of using &quot;Ionic propulsion&quot; to levitate a car, electro~stactically ( it is no diffent when your car &quot;Hydro-planes&quot; over 35 miles an hour ) and he told me about that the government ( Black Programmers&quot; ) has sucessfully built a &quot;Time Tunnel&quot; based on the &quot;Unified Field Theory&quot; and the &quot;Phildelphia Experiment&quot; on the Navy's U.S.S. Eldridge of Einstein and reseach done FROM Tesla....at first I was skeptical about such matters, and aquated it with ravings of a diranged &quot;mad men&quot;, but he used a name I was formilar with and knew he was not a &quot;mad men&quot; ( name DELETE for security reasons...will EXPLAIN later...... ) we will call him Dr. M for now....Dr. M was research the way to store greats amounts of Analog ( digital, later on ) optical Holographic data, greater then magnetic could accomplish....Time, is a very strange mechanism it is the four dimension ( 4d ) but can be inter-changed by space resulting in a ( 5d ) or Hyper~Space, which each temporal fold is 90 degrees to the previous vector, finally in-folding to the point of infinity ( or Infinity - 1 ) as a un-obtainable value or function, as a singularity in a &quot;Black Hole&quot; or neutronic temporal worm-hole colapse ending point.....He told me that Dr. M had fould that optical and electromagnet waves could store great Analog data, greater than anybody had conceived possible....Also that they now had Analog computer technology that could do chaotic calculations in the quadrilions ( remember the year is 1982 ), just now being accomplished in 2000s but only a very primitive level of digital quantum computing.....It would take a very superior computer ( Analog ) to accomplish the super~position computations necessary to control such a &quot;Time Tunnel&quot; of whic in the general market was not available, even though we were working on KRAY super computer technologies in those days.....I do not believe that the 1940s EINAC could have done such a job, it would have required such a super computer in tandem ( hundreds of machines ) to do the constant temporal corrections to keep the Space/Time in sync, almost an imposible task, but remember we built the &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot; under the same conditions, a &quot;Crash Program&quot; known better as a &quot;Black Program&quot; today, so who knows what could come FROM throwing enough money at the problem could accomplish in a short time, remember Tesla science had already exsisted, and proof of his research lead to &quot;particle beam weapons&quot; and modern electronics ( diodes, transistors, Triads, Leds, etc. ).....more on that later <br />
<a href="http://www.xzone-radio.com/tesla.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.xzone-radio.com/tesla.htm</a><br />
Which was to produce &quot;sky to water&quot; ( Blue ) invisibility, which did work intially, but but went horroribly wrong, possibly FROM mis-calculation, as they believed that they had bent light only but in fact had created a Space/Time distortion ( Gravity Scalar Wave ), brought on by their elemental understanding of Einstein's &quot;Theory of Relativity&quot; or his &quot;Special Relativity&quot; Theory, based on Gravitonics,as the graviton is not just one particle, a photon )( or Quanta ) but has a duality counter-part, a anti-photon ( or phonon, such as Fogal's CBT possesses ), such as matter has anti-matter, or to produce &quot;super conductivity&quot; requires, theoritically &quot;Cooper pairing&quot;, as the universal constant, as Greg has stated exsist as &quot;Steady State&quot; Physics shows, there is no &quot;Big Bang&quot;, sorry Hawkins, an Kiku ( &quot;String Theory&quot; ). <br />
 <br />
Our numerous experiments has simply proven them wrong, with PPCM imperical proof, and the experiments with &quot;Wave Probagation&quot;, proving that SETI is a big &quot;cosmic joke&quot; on both NASA and the US taxpayer ( it is now owned by MS Bill Gates and Paul Allen, now the &quot;Pheonix Project&quot; and SETI@Home ) as any advanced alien civilization, older than 500 to 1000 years would be using &quot;Gravity Bi~Wave&quot; to talk amongst the Stars, and these aliens would give their children the lesser &quot;low band&quot;, in the EM Hydrogen frequency, as we do with our children, crystal radios, CB, etc.<br />
 <br />
So if ET is out there he is not going to wait 200 years, or greater, between transmit and recieve ( 400 years ) to say &quot;hello&quot; and then &quot;Goodbye&quot;, as we are dealing with the speed of light ( 186,342.01 miles per sec or 300,000 meters per sec. ) and with that probagation you would not have much of a conversation, with ET, but Fogal's type of &quot;Phase Conjugate&quot; technology ( there is the Aspen device, also ) which, uniqually has no probagation ( 3d Space/Time ) delay, as we have demonstrated to both NASA and the military ( Augusta-Tech meeting, and I was there ) so they have known about this concept, but have never totally understood this Teslan function, PPCM.<br />
 <br />
Last, this was the &quot;Montauk Project&quot;, as I had said the result of the &quot;Philadelhia Experiment&quot; lesson, finally learned, with great harm to the Eldridge naval crew, our usual practice, like the atomic bomb exposure to our miltary, so what else is new, so what if those sailors got stuck in the bulkheads, its all for science sake, and if it drove the rest crazy, that is ok, they are only sailors, ya right.....<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Was that a fact? Is there credible and verifiable documentation to corroborate that and anything that is published about either Philadelphia or Montauk? <br />

If, you desire to continue, I will be glad to respond, but remember, the Internet has cyber eyes and ears ( FBI &quot; the dreaded &quot;C&quot; ) also you may find extra information at the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fbi.gov</a> and look in their archieve under Tesla, they just released about 6 Meg Bytes of confiscated documents, released by the &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot;, so called &quot;Open Records&quot; Act.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; No doubt I have been marked already, especially if, as I suspect there is some direct connection between some of my current distresses and any of these previous &quot;never happened&quot; covert operations..<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Another question for you to. In my browsing countless pages on the www about Montauk and other related topics, it was suggested that the hundreds of cell phone transmission and relay towers that are see envery, but like sentinels in the scores around every major city in North America, alre also a part of the ongoing mind control efforts of either the government or other rogue organizations and agencies. Can you enlighten at all on this topic. I have had rigning in my ears since I was about nine year of age, which has been accredited to an ear injury where one of my ear drums was punctured by aloud noise. In recent days since I have been digging INTO these things, the rigning is becoming louder, and occasionally even overbearing such as accoustic feedback, and this has happened several times in the past 10 -12 years under certain situations.<br />
~You can either stay on the course you have taken already, as the damage has been done...so you have nothing to loss, or you can just float...either way the &quot;bad guys&quot; have lost....we just have to fix the mess that has been left, and I have a way of helping you with your &quot;Inter~phase&quot; disease ( DOR ), so I will get back to you soon....<br />

I will glqadly entertain further discussioins with you or anyone else who will offer more that pe5rsonal opions and biases against others with real interest in pursuing realtime information about these things as I am finding in one of the forums I am following about Montauk. I have notices that only one individual has replied to any of the posts I have made at the Time Travel Institute forums under the new thread I began in the Montauk/PX discussion last week.<br />

I will be glad to answer all of your questions and try to help you with your possible exposure or DOR ( Deadly Orgonic Radiation ) which comes FROM emissions fo &quot;Temporal Tampering&quot; for those who do not know what they are doing or care about the harm they are causing......My associate has bee exposed to DOR and has totally recovered biologically ( he may still &quot;inter-phase&quot;, only God knows ) so we possibly may be able to remidy your auditoral coecleric damage ( ringing in the ears, as a primitive cause, the damage ear drum, very questionable, in deed......So I will answer at the bottom of your email enquires on each response of yours, and for historical reference to requalify the enfortion and make since of the DATA I am about to supply you....so be careful who generally see this reply, Zxavier...the HyTDRA Hacker<br />

~And I will use my &quot;old power name&quot; in the Hyper~Hacking community ( 2600C ), the HyTDRA Hacker <br />
 <br />
First, this was forwarded to me by <a href="http://www.ufo.org/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ufo.org/</a> or <a href="http://www.earthfriendly.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.earthfriendly.com</a> , and I feel if you have a local Teslan in your area, you should try to consult with him/her, as this type of territory is mainly alien, <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, let us park here. <br />
<br />
 1. First, what is a Teslan?<br />
~A follower of Nicola Tesla ( professional knowledge ) and we are not aliens, but &quot;good human beings&quot; <br />
<br />
 2. How would Go about locating such an one?<br />
~A follower of Nicola Tesla can not be found in the telephone directories, unless you look under Electrical Engineer, ie. EE, as I am, most, an EE knows of Tesla's invention of AC power ( not Edison ) and his dynomos at Niagra Falls power station ( the Nigra Grid, as we call it ). <br />
 <br />
 3. Alien, such as life forms other than EH-1's??<br />
~And again, we are not aliens, but &quot;good human beings&quot;, train in the &quot;Teslan way&quot;.<br />
<br />
excuse the pun, for most to understand, as what I am about to impart to you has been known by more than 300,000 plus Teslans. <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are the Teslans any relations to the Maealeans??<br />
<br />
~And once again, we are not aliens, but &quot;good human beings&quot;, trained to help humankind and do no harm to it with our or other science, like NanoTechnologies ( My E.I.N.S.T.E.I.N. Project blogger on my web site ) a credo we take very serious, following the mandate set down by Tesla himself..........&quot;help humankind and do no harm to it with our or other science&quot;, paraphrased...<br />
 <br />
To start this &quot;turn of the century&quot; ( 1900 ) journey, you must go back to that time to help you form the proper decision about what is about to be given to you as wisdom only known by &quot;true&quot; Teslans and the Defense Intellegance Agency, ie. the DIA ( the real &quot;Men In Black&quot;, ie. the MIB, and dispite what the movies have presented to the public, these are not &quot;nice people&quot;, as they will kill you if you some how interfere with their &quot;lawless&quot; agenda. Next,<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have heard only sketchy things about the clandestine protectors of the most 'secret' things in the government. I am aware that I have been under some for of surveillance for most of my adult life. In recent days, several different hellicopters and an occasional fixed-wing aircraft fly within electronic viewing distance, several close enough to be sniped at or by with conventional pea shooter weaponry. Could this be as a result of the serious digging I am in forbidden areas of understanding?<br />
<br />
~ Once apon a time, in a far off galaxy, our galaxy ( not Star Wars tm ) on a small planet called Terra ( Earth ) soon to be &quot;evil men&quot; took charge of the third planet in our solar system in the 1950s.....<br />
<br />
I started this way to make a point, we are not dealing in Sci-Fi here, people and scientist have been killed by the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; ( and I am not talking about the old USSR )....First it was President Isenhower's GROUP known as Majestic 12 ( now it is Majestic 13 ) or MJ12 as it has gotten abrievated by the military ( their normal practice ) and UFOers which originally had a possible good agenda but &quot;Wealthy evil&quot; types took over the original agenda, and caused a split, now &quot;GOOD&quot; and &quot;EVIL&quot; now ran our planet.....So, there has been a constant war to control Earth, the &quot;Good Guys&quot; Teslans, the &quot;Bad Guys&quot;, the &quot;Illuninati&quot; ( MJ12 or now MJ13 ) we are soon going to go to War ( and I am not talking about Iraq ), and the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; know they have lost, and will soon be defeated by the Teslans, as we possess hyper superior technology ( Fogal's Transistor is a toy ) when Illuminati finally raises their head, we Teslans will cut it off. ....Over 300,000 Teslans went under ground 3 years ago ( I have not been able to get in touch with them to join the fight, said to say ), to prepare for this soon historical making event, we will elliminate all who have united with them, in the most painful way we have at our disposal, to make an example of them to all future tyrrants, that we will always win......<br />
 <br />
~Now, to your surveillance, it is well known that those who come in contact purposely or accidentally are placed under monitoring, as I was told by &quot;Condor&quot; my CIA/NSA/DIA contact many years ago, sorry can not use his real name as he is still active, I worked with him in the 1980s to solve the bugging ( listenning devices ) in the Russian built American Embassy, and found the solution to neutrialize those numerous bugs, but the government did not use it.....Know the &quot;ring in your ears&quot; could have been a projected monitoring or possibly an implaint, when you were younger or at birth, that may have malfunctioned because of the intense EM you were exposed to, if you had any direct exposure to the &quot;Light&quot; ( Temporal Phasing of photons ) of both the &quot;Montauk Project / Philadelphia Experiment&quot; now advancing to more complex experimentation, as a resent EMP event had demonstrated in 2000-1, &quot;frying birds&quot;, blowing power out, and knocking out a Radio Station, in those regions known for such experiments ( your area, Ky, Tn, SC, NC, etc. ), so you are not the only one who may have been exposed, and probably won't be the last, if our &quot;mad men&quot; have their way........Below is a non &quot;Black Program&quot; Tokamak EM torroidal heating device, and if they can build this monstrocity, you can image what the &quot;Black Programmer&quot; could build back 50 years ago....what do you thing, ha....possibly nano tech, or at least micro-tech........remember the Transistor was developed in the 1950s ( Tesla concept ).... <br />

<br />
 Could this be the New concept Tocamak, size wise?<br />
 I have been a student of our lost mentor Nicola Tesla for more than 30 years, and a member of the International Tesla Society ( Colorado Springs, Colorado ) and once a member of MUFON, when I was younger and more foolish in my youth, and quit for health reasons, I strangely decided I would like to live a little bit longer, as most of us at some time meet our &quot;friendly&quot; ( NOT ) MIBs.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you know if there are any Teslans or members of MUFON in the state of SC?<br />
<br />
~Look up a Electrical Engineer, ie. EE, at one of your colleges or universities ( possible the teacher at a two year colledge ) USC.......<br />
<br />
 How about MIB activity. The old Donaldson Air Base, AKA Greenvile Air Force Base here, which has officially has been closed since the 1950's is still often visited by numerous government planes supposedly to be retrofitted for other uses by the civilian cotractor that is at the industrial park now on that site, but I lived right in the glide path of that place for over 2 years and noticed many unmarked aircraft, including military appearing copters, frequenting that refuge . . . have you any information about that?<br />
<br />
~Black Birds ( U-2, SR-71, now the Arora ), developed by the &quot;Skunk Works&quot; are obviously primitive craft compare to what true &quot;black projects&quot; possess, however, the popular choice of today is the &quot;Black Hawk&quot; Heliocopter, or something like the &quot;preditor&quot;, and the CIA at the old air base they hanger in Arizona, next to our old office HQ got bored and gave my corporate's president ( he is a pilot, &quot;birds of a feather flock together&quot; ) who graduated FROM Emery was shown the guts of the &quot;Black Bird&quot; chopper, the &quot;Long Bow&quot; over the horizon radar, top secret, ya, read Janes Journal.....and further they do use old &quot;so-called&quot; abandon <br />
military bases, of one is yours, as we had the Arora engine test by a &quot;so-called&quot; secret base in our Texas &quot;Big Thicket&quot; State Park, which injured and finally killed the people ( two, with one still serviving, barely ) who had been exposed to it's high intense nuclear scram jet pulses, with the results of both severe radiation burns ( also burned the paint off of these 3 victims' car ) cancer later, ten years ago. It would have been covered up, except for a well trained doctor who had seen radiation burns before, as our local media reported it.<br />
So, here is our tail of scientific superior technologies, hundreds of years a head of our 21ST Century, with the greatest inventor of our time, and I am not talking about Edison, I refer to Tesla, as he had ore than a 1000 patents, greater than Edison, who criminal stealing of Tesla's historical legecy of the invention of &quot;Electricity&quot; ( AC ), which has never been corrected to this day in the history books, by science or the MEDIA, and Tesla also invent &quot;Radio&quot; ( CW, RF, etc. ) not Marconi, another theif of history. Further, the reason I am giving you this &quot;history lesson&quot; is to SHOW how things and facts can be twisted, to cover-up or obsure those that would try to help &quot;humankind&quot;, and either end up dead, or discredited.<br />
 <br />
So, to answer questions today about the two Teslan projects, done by both the military and the &quot;Black Programs&quot; require a finess, only Teslan can generate, as these subjects are very complicated for the &quot;general public&quot; to understand and a great deal of scientist, who are just now beginning to comprehend who and what Tesla was and represents today in all levels of science.<br />
 <br />
Five years ago, I worked at the first Nanotechnologies corporation, at NASA, Johnson Space Center or JSC, as we call it ( home of the astronauts ), Clear lake, Texas, the Nano-Tech Research and Development Corporation ( Inc, IPO ) to help a friend of mine produce a method of manufacturing a new type of optical transistor, the Fogal &quot;Charge Barrier&quot; ( or Blocking, as Berden states ) Transistor, ie. CBT, <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~ghawk/fogal_device/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.eskimo.com/~ghawk/fogal_device/</a>. Bill has been my friend ( adopted brother and a &quot;Pain in the Ass&quot; ) and partner since 1994, and so much so he sold me one of his very powerful original six &quot;first prototype&quot; transistors, of which I have conducted thousands of experiments, based on his &quot;Pumped Phase Conjugate&quot; ( Mirror ) or PPCM optical concept, that lead to new communication technologies, not based on Electro Magnetics, ie.EM, but Teslan longitudinal Gravitonic Scalar Bi~wave. &gt;&gt;&gt; I know that I have never studied anything about these transistor technologies, and yet as with some of the theorectical physics I am curretnly studying in the book &quot;Hyperspace,&quot; some of that material was very familiar, as though somewhere I had seen it before . . . when I read your note the first time for content, it wasn't entirely strange to me.. <br />
<br />
~How and if I can EXPLAIN Bill's CB Transistor is both difficult and timely, however it has taken be almost every bit of six years to understand the rutimtary concepts just to make it work and produce a product, mainly Bill's fault, as he promised me a second CBT, but to this day I have but one ( powerful though ) to do my research, as Tom Berden has had four CBTs to my one, but that has not slowed me down in my experimentation one bit, I just simply found replacement technology to do some of Fogal's CBT functions.........But I do get mad at Bill some time, as he has cost me and my partner about $ 100,000 in cost.......and he still to this day has not produced new CBT units.......which Bill has promised me for years, as I taught him about Holo~graphic video, as he only new about Holo~graphic audio.......So I have accomplished it with a mix of different technologies fron different fields of science, mathematics, chaos ( Analog noise cancellation ) <a href="http://chaotic.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://chaotic.com</a> , Holographics ( my own VR research, ALLH ) <a href="http://holoteslab.net/index4.html" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://holoteslab.net/index4.html</a> , Nano~Tech ( NASA, JSC, Clear Lake, Texas ), and &quot;Blue to Ultra~Violet&quot; LEDS and Laser diodes ( PPCM ) and a number of bits and pieces FROM Vulcunology ( Gravitonic Wave Patterns )........<br />
<br />
Such that Bill had worked with Boeing and explained how his CBT could be used to elliminate EM &quot;noise&quot; in their 777 jets, and that he could also dramatically decrease their fuel consumption, by using the CBT to create , as I call it, &quot;Hydrogen nuecli&quot; anti-drag, and NASA and Boeing are both looking in commiting funds ( Nasa, $ 600,000, and possible a Billion dollars by Boeing, if they can get it to work ( but they are going to fail, as they are using &quot;Super Conductivity&quot; to accomplish &quot;Anti-Gravity&quot; or &quot;Propulsionless Propulsion&quot; as the idiots at NASA call it, they are afraid to you the big &quot;A-G&quot; ) and if it does not &quot;blow-up&quot; on the or worse, as they do not know what they are experimenting with.<a href="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm</a> <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chuckle <br />
<br />
~ agree, LOL........<br />
 <br />
Therefore, they are starting to delve, even though they have no idea what they are doing, as Teslans have been working on these concepts for almost a hundred years hence, <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been absolutely persuaded for over ten years, that the technology that has billed as fictional in space sci-fi, paramilitary, law enforcement and spy vs spy<br />
for at least three quarters of a century has been either real and functional in some rudimentary form at the time, and / or real in the future that has been sent back in the form of historical abstracts to be shown in media fiction as a stark warning of what to expect in the future if we don't get straight. How far off base am I with these wild specilations of mine&gt;?<br />
<br />
~Right on the money, sad to say....... and this now gets back to the totally mis-understood &quot; Montauk Project / Philadelhia Eexperiment&quot; such as to have skewed Tesla's original iinvolvement, his four &quot;field coil&quot; generators ( Einstein/TESLA/Gravitonic ) on the U.S.S.Eldridge at the Philadelphia Naval &quot;proving grounds&quot;, which lead to the Montauk Project which lead to the possible controlling Space/Time ( 4th dimension ), mainly time, as the CBT has proven with test at NASA at JPL, Dr. Greg Hodewanek and Bill Ramsey, who has been experimenting with &quot;Inter-phase&quot; the original problem that had un-expectively developed during the final phase of the &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot;.<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you tell me, what exactly did happen at Montauk? I have read three of the Nichols and Moon books in the past. My concern is that I know I was at least Montauk near the light twice between the spring of 1959 and the fall of 1960 as an eight and nine year old. I believe that I am one who is gifted with natural phase shifting abilities and these may have been maleffected by my being in the close proximity of such a powerful phase shifting rf field. Was the Montauk Light ever a part of these experiments as a transducer/traceiver in modulated light experiments?<br />
<br />
~That is a very long story, as only &quot;bits and piece&quot; sometime have &quot;sneaked out&quot;, but it is rare to get the &quot;whole story&quot; in one shot, so you will have to take my word on what I am about to tell you, and you can take it with a &quot;grain of salt&quot;, or &quot;ton of salt&quot; but a lot of what I know came FROM reliable sources over the years, NASA meetings, Tesla meeting, contacts in the scientific and military communities......I had a conversation in 1982, at the Nationional Computer Conference, ie. NCC ( like Comdex, but world, very big....) and met a EE who was exploring the possiblity of using &quot;Ionic propulsion&quot; to levitate a car, electro~stactically ( it is no diffent when your car &quot;Hydro-planes&quot; over 35 miles an hour ) and he told me about that the government ( Black Programmers&quot; ) has sucessfully built a &quot;Time Tunnel&quot; based on the &quot;Unified Field Theory&quot; and the &quot;Phildelphia Experiment&quot; on the Navy's U.S.S. Eldridge of Einstein and reseach done FROM Tesla....at first I was skeptical about such matters, and aquated it with ravings of a diranged &quot;mad men&quot;, but he used a name I was formilar with and knew he was not a &quot;mad men&quot; ( name DELETE for security reasons...will EXPLAIN later...... ) we will call him Dr. M for now....Dr. M was research the way to store greats amounts of Analog ( digital, later on ) optical Holographic data, greater then magnetic could accomplish....Time, is a very strange mechanism it is the four dimension ( 4d ) but can be inter-changed by space resulting in a ( 5d ) or Hyper~Space, which each temporal fold is 90 degrees to the previous vector, finally in-folding to the point of infinity ( or Infinity - 1 ) as a un-obtainable value or function, as a singularity in a &quot;Black Hole&quot; or neutronic temporal worm-hole colapse ending point.....He told me that Dr. M had fould that optical and electromagnet waves could store great Analog data, greater than anybody had conceived possible....Also that they now had Analog computer technology that could do chaotic calculations in the quadrilions ( remember the year is 1982 ), just now being accomplished in 2000s but only a very primitive level of digital quantum computing.....It would take a very superior computer ( Analog ) to accomplish the super~position computations necessary to control such a &quot;Time Tunnel&quot; of whic in the general market was not available, even though we were working on KRAY super computer technologies in those days.....I do not believe that the 1940s EINAC could have done such a job, it would have required such a super computer in tandem ( hundreds of machines ) to do the constant temporal corrections to keep the Space/Time in sync, almost an imposible task, but remember we built the &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot; under the same conditions, a &quot;Crash Program&quot; known better as a &quot;Black Program&quot; today, so who knows what could come FROM throwing enough money at the problem could accomplish in a short time, remember Tesla science had already exsisted, and proof of his research lead to &quot;particle beam weapons&quot; and modern electronics ( diodes, transistors, Triads, Leds, etc. ).....more on that later <br />
<a href="http://www.xzone-radio.com/tesla.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.xzone-radio.com/tesla.htm</a><br />
Which was to produce &quot;sky to water&quot; ( Blue ) invisibility, which did work intially, but but went horroribly wrong, possibly FROM mis-calculation, as they believed that they had bent light only but in fact had created a Space/Time distortion ( Gravity Scalar Wave ), brought on by their elemental understanding of Einstein's &quot;Theory of Relativity&quot; or his &quot;Special Relativity&quot; Theory, based on Gravitonics,as the graviton is not just one particle, a photon )( or Quanta ) but has a duality counter-part, a anti-photon ( or phonon, such as Fogal's CBT possesses ), such as matter has anti-matter, or to produce &quot;super conductivity&quot; requires, theoritically &quot;Cooper pairing&quot;, as the universal constant, as Greg has stated exsist as &quot;Steady State&quot; Physics shows, there is no &quot;Big Bang&quot;, sorry Hawkins, an Kiku ( &quot;String Theory&quot; ). <br />
 <br />
Our numerous experiments has simply proven them wrong, with PPCM imperical proof, and the experiments with &quot;Wave Probagation&quot;, proving that SETI is a big &quot;cosmic joke&quot; on both NASA and the US taxpayer ( it is now owned by MS Bill Gates and Paul Allen, now the &quot;Pheonix Project&quot; and SETI@Home ) as any advanced alien civilization, older than 500 to 1000 years would be using &quot;Gravity Bi~Wave&quot; to talk amongst the Stars, and these aliens would give their children the lesser &quot;low band&quot;, in the EM Hydrogen frequency, as we do with our children, crystal radios, CB, etc.<br />
 <br />
So if ET is out there he is not going to wait 200 years, or greater, between transmit and recieve ( 400 years ) to say &quot;hello&quot; and then &quot;Goodbye&quot;, as we are dealing with the speed of light ( 186,342.01 miles per sec or 300,000 meters per sec. ) and with that probagation you would not have much of a conversation, with ET, but Fogal's type of &quot;Phase Conjugate&quot; technology ( there is the Aspen device, also ) which, uniqually has no probagation ( 3d Space/Time ) delay, as we have demonstrated to both NASA and the military ( Augusta-Tech meeting, and I was there ) so they have known about this concept, but have never totally understood this Teslan function, PPCM.<br />
 <br />
Last, this was the &quot;Montauk Project&quot;, as I had said the result of the &quot;Philadelhia Experiment&quot; lesson, finally learned, with great harm to the Eldridge naval crew, our usual practice, like the atomic bomb exposure to our miltary, so what else is new, so what if those sailors got stuck in the bulkheads, its all for science sake, and if it drove the rest crazy, that is ok, they are only sailors, ya right.....<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Was that a fact? Is there credible and verifiable documentation to corroborate that and anything that is published about either Philadelphia or Montauk? <br />

If, you desire to continue, I will be glad to respond, but remember, the Internet has cyber eyes and ears ( FBI &quot; the dreaded &quot;C&quot; ) also you may find extra information at the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fbi.gov</a> and look in their archieve under Tesla, they just released about 6 Meg Bytes of confiscated documents, released by the &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot;, so called &quot;Open Records&quot; Act.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; No doubt I have been marked already, especially if, as I suspect there is some direct connection between some of my current distresses and any of these previous &quot;never happened&quot; covert operations..<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Another question for you to. In my browsing countless pages on the www about Montauk and other related topics, it was suggested that the hundreds of cell phone transmission and relay towers that are see envery, but like sentinels in the scores around every major city in North America, alre also a part of the ongoing mind control efforts of either the government or other rogue organizations and agencies. Can you enlighten at all on this topic. I have had rigning in my ears since I was about nine year of age, which has been accredited to an ear injury where one of my ear drums was punctured by aloud noise. In recent days since I have been digging INTO these things, the rigning is becoming louder, and occasionally even overbearing such as accoustic feedback, and this has happened several times in the past 10 -12 years under certain situations.<br />
~You can either stay on the course you have taken already, as the damage has been done...so you have nothing to loss, or you can just float...either way the &quot;bad guys&quot; have lost....we just have to fix the mess that has been left, and I have a way of helping you with your &quot;Inter~phase&quot; disease ( DOR ), so I will get back to you soon....<br />

I will glqadly entertain further discussioins with you or anyone else who will offer more that personal opions and biases against others with real interest in pursuing realtime information about these things as I am finding in one of the forums I am following about Montauk.

so we possibly may be able to remidy your auditoral coecleric damage ( ringing in the ears, as a primitive cause, the damage ear drum, very questionable, in deed......So I will answer at the bottom of your email enquires on each response of yours, and for historical reference to requalify the enfortion and make since of the DATA I am about to supply you....so be careful who generally see this reply, Zxavier...the HyTDRA Hacker<br />

 <br />
~And I will use my &quot;old power name&quot; in the Hyper~Hacking community ( 2600C ), the HyTDRA Hacker <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's fine with me . . . .<br />
 <br />
First, this was forwarded to me by <a href="http://www.ufo.org/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ufo.org/</a> or <a href="http://www.earthfriendly.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.earthfriendly.com</a> , and I feel if you have a local Teslan in your area, you should try to consult with him/her, as this type of territory is mainly alien, <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, let us park here. <br />
 1. First, what is a Teslan?<br />
 <br />
~A follower of Nicola Tesla ( professional knowledge ) and we are not aliens, but &quot;good human beings&quot; <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; To your knowledge are there other intelligent life humanoid forms on this time line's good ol' Earth besides ours? I tend to believe that there are.<br />
 <br />
 2. How would Go about locating such an one?<br />
 <br />
~A follower of Nicola Tesla can not be found in the telephone directories, unless you look under Electrical Engineer, ie. EE, as I am, most, an EE knows of Tesla's invention of AC power ( not Edison ) and his dynomos at Niagra Falls power station ( the Nigra Grid, as we call it ). <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Might there be one in the Greenville, SC area that you could direct and refer me to for further assistance in these careful matters?<br />
 <br />
 3. Alien, such as life forms other than EH-1's??<br />
<br />
~And again, we are not aliens, but &quot;good human beings&quot;, train in the &quot;Teslan way&quot;.<br />
excuse the pun, for most to understand, as what I am about to impart to you has been known by more than 300,000 plus Teslans. <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are the Teslans any relations to the Maealeans??<br />
 <br />
~And once again, we are not aliens, but &quot;good human beings&quot;, trained to help humankind and do no harm to it with our or other science, like NanoTechnologies ( My E.I.N.S.T.E.I.N. Project blogger on my web site ) a credo we take very serious, following the mandate set down by Tesla himself..........&quot;help humankind and do no harm to it with our or other science&quot;, paraphrased...<br />
 <br />
To start this &quot;turn of the century&quot; ( 1900 ) journey, you must go back to that time to help you form the proper decision about what is about to be given to you as wisdom only known by &quot;true&quot; Teslans and the Defense Intellegance Agency, ie. the DIA ( the real &quot;Men In Black&quot;, ie. the MIB, and dispite what the movies have presented to the public, these are not &quot;nice people&quot;, as they will kill you if you some how interfere with their &quot;lawless&quot; agenda. Next,<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have heard only sketchy things about the clandestine protectors of the most 'secret' things in the government. I am aware that I have been under some for of surveillance for most of my adult life. In recent days, several different hellicopters and an occasional fixed-wing aircraft fly within electronic viewing distance, several close enough to be sniped at or by with conventional pea shooter weaponry. Could this be as a result of the serious digging I am in forbidden areas of understanding?<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; All but one of the three different choppers bore the insignia of local television stations, but that doesn't mean anything at all, the fixed wing aircraft last week had no other markings besides the registration number. <br />
 <br />
~ Once apon a time, in a far off galaxy, our galaxy ( not Star Wars tm ) on a small planet called Terra ( Earth ) soon to be &quot;evil men&quot; took charge of the third planet in our solar system in the 1950s.....<br />
I started this way to make a point, we are not dealing in Sci-Fi here,<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Neither am I, no not at all . . .<br />
 <br />
 people and scientist have been killed by the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; ( and I am not talking about the old USSR )....First it was President Isenhower's GROUP known as Majestic 12 <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have seen some of the hollywood plays on this, knowing it was only a scratch on the surface . . .<br />
 <br />
( now it is Majestic 13 ) or MJ12 as it has gotten abrievated by the military ( their normal practice ) and UFOers which originally had a possible good agenda but &quot;Wealthy evil&quot; types took over the original agenda, and caused a split, now &quot;GOOD&quot; and &quot;EVIL&quot; now ran our planet.....So, there has been a constant war to control Earth, the &quot;Good Guys&quot; Teslans, the &quot;Bad Guys&quot;, the &quot;Illuninati&quot; ( MJ12 or now MJ13 ) we are soon going to go to War ( and I am not talking about Iraq ), and the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; know they have lost, and will soon be defeated by the Teslans, as we possess hyper superior technology ( Fogal's Transistor is a toy ) when Illuminati finally raises their head, we Teslans will cut it off. ....Over 300,000 Teslans went under ground 3 years ago ( I have not been able to get in touch with them to join the fight, said to say ), to prepare for this soon historical making event, we will elliminate all who have united with them, in the most painful way we have at our disposal, to make an example of them to all future tyrrants, that we will always win......<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;Perchance have you ever heard of the USIS and/or the PTF, or the YMC?<br />
 <br />
~Now, to your surveillance, it is well known that those who come in contact purposely or accidentally are placed under monitoring, as I was told by &quot;Condor&quot; my CIA/NSA/DIA contact many years ago, sorry can not use his real name as he is still active, I worked with him in the 1980s to solve the bugging ( listenning devices ) in the Russian built American Embassy, and found the solution to neutrialize those numerous bugs, but the government did not use it.....<br />
 <br />
I started reading, but did not finish the reading the book &quot;Spy catcher,&quot; written by one of the former insiders of I Think it was M15 during and after WWII, who helpend unbug that bugging system and worked in the techmnbology to make it further useful for the British and US governments.<br />
 <br />
Know the &quot;ring in your ears&quot; could have been a projected monitoring or possibly an implaint, when you were younger or at birth, <br />
 <br />
In the early 1990's I was led in a sort of Alice In Wonderland type story where I was alleged to have been a part of an elaborate underground covert researh and developement project. let me see if I can get all the terminology correct....it was purported to be a paramilitary/quasigovernment/eugenics and cybernetics research and developement project with all sorts of bizarre cloning, implantation of cybernetics and micronics devices . . . it was really wild. This occurred while I was incarcerated for a felony offense that I actually committed . . . some of this wild scenaro included my HAVING been swapped in and out of at least one other lifestyle across a grey zone and on and on. The individual that led me through this I have since lost contact with and is being protected by someone . . . I have tried to dismiss this, but now wonder if this could have actually happened on another time line that I was phasing back and forth over many times in my life. <br />
 I said all of the in regards to the &quot;Punkin Patch and Presidential Task Force Scenario, because this is when I first had the feedback problems with my ears . . .although I had noticed for many years that certain ring frequencies in my ears would become more intense aoften when around high tension power lines . . .<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
that may have malfunctioned because of the intense EM you were exposed to, if you had any direct exposure to the &quot;Light&quot; ( Temporal Phasing of photons ) of both the &quot;Montauk Project / Philadelphia Experiment&quot;<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Back to a previous question . . . was the Montauk Light House itself used as a part of those experiments?<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; One other question too.....in one of the Nichols / Moon books on Montauk, they made extensive mention of the Earth's Morphogenic Grid. I did some rearch on that and everywhere I have lived for most of my life, even while moving around in the USAF as mircrowave radio manitenance technician, I was on or very near a major node of this grid, and even now today in Greenville, SC . . . do you have any comments as to this item?<br />
 <br />
 now advancing to more complex experimentation, as a resent EMP event had demonstrated in 2000-1, &quot;frying birds&quot;, blowing power out, and knocking out a Radio Station, in those regions known for such experiments ( your area, Ky, Tn, SC, NC, etc. ), so you are not the only one who may have been exposed, and probably won't be the last, if our &quot;mad men&quot; have their way........<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; COuld this be something that is being done at the Donaldson Industrial Center outside of Greenville?<br />
 <br />
Below is a non &quot;Black Program&quot; Tokamak EM torroidal heating device, and if they can build this monstrocity, you can image what the &quot;Black Programmer&quot; could build back 50 years ago....what do you thing, ha....possibly nano tech, or at least micro-tech........remember the Transistor was developed in the 1950s ( Tesla concept ).... <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The picture did not come throught at all. Is there a link I could follow to view that, if you please,thanks. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Zx note: I have the picture for anyone who is interested for a personal E-Mail to <a href="mailto:CmdZxavier@Yahoo.Com">CmdZxavier@Yahoo.Com</a>. <br />
 <br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
 Could this be the New concept Tocamak, size wise?<br />
 <br />
 I have been a student of our lost mentor Nicola Tesla for more than 30 years, and a member of the International Tesla Society ( Colorado Springs, Colorado ) and once a member of MUFON, when I was younger and more foolish in my youth, and quit for health reasons, I strangely decided I would like to live a little bit longer, as most of us at some time meet our &quot;friendly&quot; ( NOT ) MIBs.<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you know if there are any Teslans or members of MUFON in the state of SC?<br />
 <br />
~Look up a Electrical Engineer, ie. EE, at one of your colleges or universities ( possible the teacher at a two year colledge ) USC....... <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;I must close for now. I will continue this later in the evening.<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt;ME . But that was along time ago... If you can read through some of my old old posts, I mention how I was constantly feeling shifted and phased (bleeding through) other realities. I haven't been getting these feelings as great in frequency as in the beginning (but more in other ways and means). I am more grounded (dull) and more human (reasonable) now then ever not to mention those responsible know better then to make me an even bigger adversary .<br />
<br />
-TTA&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
 Would you care to elaborate more on this? What did you sense in these times? What triggered them, as you would suppose? Ae you implying that this was deliberately caused, and if so why and by whom?<br />

Hello Zxavier - I just wanted to make you aware that Al Bielek will make a rare appearance at the 4th Annual Bay Area UFO Expo., Sept 14 - 15, at the Santa Clara Marriot Hotel. <a href="http://www.thebayareaUFOexpo.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.thebayareaUFOexpo.com</a> <br />
<br />
I will be there. My name is Larry Jamison, host of &quot;The Larry Jamison Show.&quot; heard here in San Luis Obispo on KGLW, 1340 AM., <a href="http://www.kglw.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.kglw.com</a> <br />
<br />
Al Bielek will give his free lecture 2:00 to 2:45 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 14 and his workshop is 3:15 to 5:00 p.m. that same day. I will be at the David Icke workshop which over-laps Al, so I will have to buy the tape FROM his presentation. I hope to see you there. <br />
<br />
best always, Larry Jamison, host, &quot;The Larry Jamison Show&quot;<br />

Larry, <br />

Yes, I received the big blurb you sent to my personal E-Mail address with the X-Chronicles. I would be thrilled to be there, however, this is not a possibility short of a miracle or two. I am across the country in Greenville, SC, and living in a homeless shelter on top of that, with no expense monies for the rare oportunity of speaking with another who might be able to give me some reliable information about Motauk, PX and other related topics. <br />
<br />
If you are Following my posts at the X-Chronicles, you are aware that I am in detailed exchanges with R. A. Berman CCSC ( edu, com, gov, mil(cc) ), <br />
E-mail: <a href="mailto:holo@holoteslab.net">holo@holoteslab.net</a>, &quot;~And I will use my &quot;old power name&quot; in the Hyper~Hacking community ( 2600C ), the HyTDRA Hacker,&quot; as well as posting a Montauk Forum at <a href="http://www.voyager.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">www.voyager.com</a>, <a href="http://www.voy.com/101340/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.voy.com/101340/</a>, and at <a href="http://www.SAFe-mail.Net" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">www.SAFe-mail.Net</a>. My current flurry of activity is as a direct result of my firm belief that I was inadvertantly exposed to Deadly Orgonic Radiation in possibly two diferent forms as a child while visiting Montauk Point at an overnight stay on the beach between the ages of eight and nine.<br />
<br />
Still digging for the truth,<br />

Round #2 Part 2 <br />
<br />
 I am somewhat handicapped by HAVING to use public Web Termainals at the local library through their WAN, at which I must submit to hour long blocks of access time, plus I live in a homeless whelter which has certain restrictions of comings and goings day and night. This is getting to be a much greater hassle with this ongoing research project. <br />

 How about MIB activity. The old Donaldson Air Base, AKA Greenvile Air Force Base here, which has officially has been closed since the 1950's is still often visited by numerous government planes supposedly to be retrofitted for other uses by the civilian cotractor that is at the industrial park now on that site, but I lived right in the glide path of that place for over 2 years and noticed many unmarked aircraft, including military appearing copters, frequenting that refuge . . . have you any information about that?<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I must also note that while in the Air Force between May 1971 and December 1980, I was at the following locations that I am certain of HAVING been There are other possibilities if the PP &amp; PTF Scenario have any crdibility at all: In ORDER FROM Baisc Traning: Lackland AFB, San Antonio, TX, May - June 1971, Keesler AFB, Biloxi, MS, June 1971 - April 1972, Kadena Air Base, Okinawa Jima, Japan April 1972 - May 1973, Shaw AFB, Sumter, SC, June 1973 - April 1977, Lajes Field, Terceira, Azores, May 1977 - January 1981. I also passed through Travis AFB, CA coming and going to and FROM Kadena, and Mc Guire AFB, Wrightstown, NJ coming and going to and FROM Lajes. I can elablrate a little more on some of that, but most is verry foggy at this point. This does not surprise me at all since Ihave reason to believe the fact of my visible military activies were just a cover anyway . . .<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was also assigned TDY and Nellis AFB, Las Vegas for a short period of time, and at several others during so-called &quot;war games&quot; in the 1970's. While at Nellis I almost &quot;fried,&quot; I suppose what would be called a nervous breakdown, for no apparent reason. this occurrred several times while I was on active duty in the Air Force, at least once at Shaw AFB, proper, once while TDY at Nellis, and at least once while I was at Lajes Field. Actually, I believe I may have undergone a complete phase split and lost it during reintergratiion. I say this assuming that you believe there is such a thing as natural phase shifting and splitting. More on this supposition later in another dirge.<br />
 <br />
~Black Birds ( U-2, SR-71, now the Arora ), <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; The SR-71 &quot;Habu&quot; was a pretty bird to watch taking off INTO the early morning as they did daily FROM Kadena while I was stationed there. It was a stock joke about their &quot;going to watch the sun over Korea every day. I haven't seen anything like that locally, but some very strange looking birds do fly out of Donaldson and that quite oft.<br />
 <br />
developed by the &quot;Skunk Works&quot; are obviously primitive craft compare to what true &quot;black projects&quot; possess, however, the popular choice of today is the &quot;Black Hawk&quot; Heliocopter, or something like the &quot;preditor&quot;, and the CIA at the old air base they hanger in Arizona, next to our old office HQ got bored and gave my corporate's president ( he is a pilot, &quot;birds of a feather flock together&quot; ) who graduated FROM Emery was shown the guts of the &quot;Black Bird&quot; chopper, the &quot;Long Bow&quot; over the horizon radar, top secret, ya, read Janes Journal.....and further they do use old &quot;so-called&quot; abandoned military bases, of one is yours, as we had the Arora engine test by a &quot;so-called&quot; secret base<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; You're corroborating my suspicioins about the Donaldson Air Base still being used covertly by rogue factions of the government and/or others ????<br />
 <br />
 in our Texas &quot;Big Thicket&quot; State Park, which injured and finally killed the people ( two, with one still serviving, barely ) who had been exposed to it's high intense nuclear scram jet pulses, with the results of both severe radiation burns ( also burned the paint off of these 3 victims' car ) cancer later, ten years ago. It would have been covered up, except for a well trained doctor who had seen radiation burns before, as our local media reported it.<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Just prior to my moving to the Rescue Mission in downtown Greenville, FROM the neighborhood only on the edge of the Donalson Industrial Park, I started noticing an irritation on my right hand, I thought at first to be an allergy or perhaps FROM a insect or spider bite one of the fingers. This has now become a burning itching mess that is spreading gradually up the entire upper portion of my right hand. It has several different phases including dry scalls, open sore, and larger red lumps that resemble blind boils that never take a head. Some times, this aches all the way INTO the bones of my hand. Could this be the result of some form of narrow beam radiation poisoning? I am certain there were many covert radiation experiments happening at Donaldson, since ofter other RF devices just refused to workproperly if at all in that area.<br />
 <br />
So, here is o?ur tail of scientific superior technologies, hundreds of years a head of our 21ST Century, with the greatest inventor of our time, and I am not talking about Edison, I refer to Tesla, as he had ore than a 1000 patents, greater than Edison, who criminal stealing of Tesla's historical legecy of the invention of &quot;Electricity&quot; ( AC ), which has never been corrected to this day in the history books, by science or the MEDIA, and Tesla also invent &quot;Radio&quot; ( CW, RF, etc. ) not Marconi, another theif of history. Further, the reason I am giving you this &quot;history lesson&quot; is to SHOW how things and facts can be twisted, to cover-up or obsure those that would try to help &quot;humankind&quot;, and either end up dead, or discredited.<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no problems with that. This is only in agreement with the author of &quot;HyperSpace.&quot;<br />
 <br />
So, to answer questions today about the two Teslan projects, done by both the military and the &quot;Black Programs&quot; require a finess, only Teslan can generate, as these subjects are very complicated for the &quot;general public&quot; to understand and a great deal of scientist, who are just now beginning to comprehend who and what Tesla was and represents today in all levels of science.<br />
 <br />
Five years ago, I worked at the first Nanotechnologies corporation, at NASA, Johnson Space Center or JSC, as we call it ( home of the astronauts ), Clear lake, Texas, the Nano-Tech Research and Development Corporation ( Inc, IPO ) to help a friend of mine produce a method of manufacturing a new type of optical transistor, the Fogal &quot;Charge Barrier&quot; ( or Blocking, as Berden states ) Transistor, ie. CBT, <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~ghawk/fogal_device/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.eskimo.com/~ghawk/fogal_device/</a>. Bill has been my friend ( adopted brother and a &quot;Pain in the Ass&quot; ) and partner since 1994, and so much so he sold me one of his very powerful original six &quot;first prototype&quot; transistors, of which I have conducted thousands of experiments, based on his &quot;Pumped Phase Conjugate&quot; ( Mirror ) or PPCM optical concept, that lead to new communication technologies, not based on Electro Magnetics, ie.EM, but Teslan longitudinal Gravitonic Scalar Bi~wave.<br />
 <br />
 &gt;&gt;&gt; I know that I have never studied anything about these transistor technologies, and yet as with some of the theorectical physics I am curretnly studying in the book &quot;Hyperspace,&quot; some of that material was very familiar, as though somewhere I had seen it before . . . when I read your note the first time for content, it wasn't entirely strange to me.. <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; And it wasn't something I read studying basic electronics in the Air Force or anything for my Amateur Radio Lcence, WA4YXJ . .. but I know I have seen these things before in more than just reading casually. <br />
 <br />
~How and if I can EXPLAIN Bill's CB Transistor is both difficult and timely, however it has taken be almost every bit of six years to understand the rutimtary concepts just to make it work and produce a product, mainly Bill's fault, as he promised me a second CBT, but to this day I have but one ( powerful though ) to do my research, as Tom Berden has had four CBTs to my one, but that has not slowed me down in my experimentation one bit, I just simply found replacement technology to do some of Fogal's CBT functions.........But I do get mad at Bill some time, as he has cost me and my partner about $ 100,000 in cost.......and he still to this day has not produced new CBT units.......which Bill has promised me for years, as I taught him about Holo~graphic video, as he only new about Holo~graphic audio.......So I have accomplished it with a mix of different technologies fron different fields of science, mathematics, chaos ( Analog noise cancellation ) <a href="http://chaotic.com" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://chaotic.com</a> , Holographics ( my own VR research, ALLH ) <a href="http://holoteslab.net/index4.html" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://holoteslab.net/index4.html</a> , Nano~Tech ( NASA, JSC, Clear Lake, Texas ), and &quot;Blue to Ultra~Violet&quot; LEDS and Laser diodes ( PPCM ) and a number of bits and pieces FROM Vulcunology ( Gravitonic Wave Patterns )........<br />
Such that Bill had worked with Boeing and explained how his CBT could be used to elliminate EM &quot;noise&quot; in their 777 jets, and that he could also dramatically decrease their fuel consumption, by using the CBT to create , as I call it, &quot;Hydrogen nuecli&quot; anti-drag, and NASA and Boeing are both looking in commiting funds ( Nasa, $ 600,000, and possible a Billion dollars by Boeing, if they can get it to work ( but they are going to fail, as they are using &quot;Super Conductivity&quot; to accomplish &quot;Anti-Gravity&quot; or &quot;Propulsionless Propulsion&quot; as the idiots at NASA call it, they are afraid to you the big &quot;A-G&quot; ) and if it does not &quot;blow-up&quot; on the or worse, as they do not know what they are experimenting with.<a href="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm</a> <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chuckle <br />
<br />
~ agree, LOL........<br />
 <br />
Therefore, they are starting to delve, even though they have no idea what they are doing, as Teslans have been working on these concepts for almost a hundred years hence, <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been absolutely persuaded for over ten years, that the technology that has billed as fictional in space sci-fi, paramilitary, law enforcement and spy vs spy<br />
for at least three quarters of a century has been either real and functional in some rudimentary form at the time, and / or real in the future that has been sent back in the form of historical abstracts to be shown in media fiction as a stark warning of what to expect in the future if we don't get straight. How far off base am I with these wild specilations of mine&gt;?<br />
 <br />
~Right on the money, sad to say.......<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words concerning transporter &amp; teleporation, the technology did exist at the time of the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; Series in the late 1960'S? How about Warp Drive engines?<br />
 Would you believe that I am out of time again? I must relog on to the system or lose this item without sending it.<br />
 <br />
Sincerely,<br />
Zxavier<br />

Cmdr Zxavier - I appreciate your prompt reply. Because you access the message boards, I will post back to xchronicles after I meet Al Bielek. I have been asked to give him the phone number and address of Dennis Bossack, owner of DNA Live Radio in Deming, N.M. Dennis told me that Al had talked of moving to Deming himself soon, so I have this feeling that we will have more exchanges down the road. <br />
<br />
Dennis has decided to re-broadcast my radio program archives Tuesdays, 7-8 p.m. Moutain time and Thurs, 7-8 p.m. Mountain time. Maybe you cannot listen to audio files on a public computer, but I thought I would give you the information just the same. <br />
<br />
Click the hyperlink &quot;DNA LIVE RADIO&quot; and on that page click the radio program banner further down the page. <br />
<br />
Thanks for writing back...live well, Larry J. <br />
<br />
 Larry, <br />
<br />
 Thank you so very much for responding personally. For some reason my correspondence with the other previously mentioned party has abruptly ended, as suddenly as it began. I am trusting that this is a temporary situation and that my intense line of questioning over unsecured internet E-Mails has not jeapordized him. <br />
<br />
 It seems that any detailed discussions of the Montauk Project, Philadelphia Eaperiment or any other such related topics of noe-existent quaisi-government operations, almost immediately draws the attention of similarly none existen quaisi-government (deliberately misspelled quaisi- Zx) watchdogs, to make things difficult. <br />
<br />
 Do you suppose that Al Bielek would entertain any personal corrspondence with myself at any point? Do you have a valid E-Mail address for him, that you are at liberty to give out for those need ing more serious investigation INTO these things? There appears to be none to be found at his site <a href="http://www.bielek.com/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bielek.com/</a>, or anwwhere else. Likewise for any of the other reported key operatives in the Montauk Project. <br />
<br />
 Any and all assistance you can and will provide in my search for the truth that is out there is greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Still digging fervently, <br />
<br />
Zxavier <br />

Subject: Re: Montauk, PX, etc...Round #2 Part #3 <br />
To: &quot;R. A. Berman C.C.S.C.&quot; &lt;holo@holoteslab.net&gt; <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully, I can finish up in this hour block. This is becoming quite a time consuming investigation and tiring also.<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you tell me, what exactly did happen at Montauk? I have read three of the Nichols and Moon books in the past. My concern is that I know I was at least Montauk near the light twice between the spring of 1959 and the fall of 1960 as an eight and nine year old. I believe that I am one who is gifted with natural phase shifting abilities and these may have been maleffected by my being in the close proximity of such a powerful phase shifting rf field. Was the Montauk Light ever a part of these experiments as a transducer/traceiver in modulated light experiments?<br />
 <br />
~That is a very long story, as only &quot;bits and piece&quot; sometime have &quot;sneaked out&quot;, but it is rare to get the <br />
&quot;whole story&quot; in one shot, so you will have to take my word on what I am about to tell you, and you can take it with a &quot;grain of salt&quot;, or &quot;ton of salt&quot; but a lot of what I know came FROM reliable sources over the years, NASA meetings, Tesla meeting, contacts in the scientific and military communities......I had a conversation in 1982, at the Nationional Computer Conference, ie. NCC ( like Comdex, but world, very big....) and met a EE who was exploring the possiblity of using &quot;Ionic propulsion&quot; to levitate a car, electro~stactically ( it is no diffent when your car &quot;Hydro-planes&quot; over 35 miles an hour ) and he told me about that the government ( Black Programmers&quot; ) has sucessfully built a &quot;Time Tunnel&quot; based on the &quot;Unified Field Theory&quot; and the &quot;Phildelphia Experiment&quot; on the Navy's U.S.S. Eldridge of Einstein and reseach done FROM Tesla....at first I was skeptical about such matters, and aquated it with ravings of a diranged &quot;mad men&quot;, but he used a name I was formilar with and knew he was not a &quot;mad men&quot; ( name DELETE for security reasons...will EXPLAIN later...... ) we will call him Dr. M for now....Dr. M <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; That wasn't Maxwell or Miller was it? When I was young living in Montvale, NJ, our Family doctor was Dr. George Miller. He was a somewaht eccentric person, one of the first in the 60's to have a deisel powered car . . . I relocated FROM NNJ with my family to Walton, NY in October 1962, soon afterwards Dr. Miller resigned his medical practice to take a commission in the US Navy. I was only partially paying attention as a teenager, howver, I ebeleve that my father told my he was a Admiral with his own shit by the time I was in my early teens....that is very rapid progression if you ask me. This &quot;Family Physician,&quot; as he later was referred to in the &quot;Punkin Patch and Presidential Task Force&quot; scenario, had his practice adjacent to his own home, including the X-Ray equipment.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;Another interesting note as well. My Uncle Eugene James Laurier, my father's older brother was alledge to have been killed in 1943 in a plane crash dyuring a training flight in Florida. My father never spoke much of his brother as I was growing up, and Uncle James came up in the scenario as a key player also. I have for the past 11 plus years had the gnawing inner persuasion that Uncle James was not really killed in that reported accident but this was only another of many reidentifcation devises the government uses when operatives get too hot and must disappear for a fashion, even as my staying in prsion was supposed to be a cool down when the orginal Plan A failed and I admitted I was guilty. Am I a aving maniac....I don't believe so . . . You're welcomed to embrace that if you wish. I am merely attempting to ravel some major mysteries that all my be a part of the same ugly knot!!<br />
 <br />
~ was research the way to store greats amounts of Analog ( digital, later on ) optical Holographic data, greater then magnetic could accomplish....Time, is a very strange mechanism it is the four dimension ( 4d ) but can be inter-changed by space resulting in a ( 5d ) or Hyper~Space, which each temporal fold is 90 degrees to the previous vector, finally in-folding to the point of infinity <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it possible for us &quot;normally,&quot; what even this &quot;normal&quot; is, to sense phase shfits in the space/time contiuum? In the past several days, the elements themselves bespeak of a major phase disturbance..... This isn't really something you can quantify, only sense, I believe . . . .<br />
 <br />
( or Infinity - 1 ) as a un-obtainable value or function, as a singularity in a &quot;Black Hole&quot; or neutronic temporal worm-hole colapse ending point.....He told me that Dr. M had fould that optical and electromagnet waves could store great Analog data, greater than anybody had conceived possible....Also that they now had Analog computer technology that could do chaotic calculations in the quadrilions ( remember the year is 1982 ), just now being accomplished in 2000s but only a very primitive level of digital quantum computing.....It would take a very superior computer ( Analog ) to accomplish the super~position computations necessary to control such a &quot;Time Tunnel&quot; of whic in the general market was not available, even though we were working on KRAY super computer technologies in those days.....I do not believe that the 1940s EINAC could have done such a job, <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most doubtful ...<br />
 <br />
it would have required such a super computer in tandem ( hundreds of machines ) to do the constant temporal corrections to keep the Space/Time in sync, almost an imposible task, but remember we built the &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot; under the same conditions, a &quot;Crash Program&quot; known better as a &quot;Black Program&quot; today, so who knows what could come FROM throwing enough money at the problem could accomplish in a short time, remember Tesla science had already exsisted, and proof of his research lead to &quot;particle beam weapons&quot; and modern electronics ( diodes, transistors, Triads, Leds, etc. ).....more on that later <br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Great deal !!! <br />
 <br />

 <br />
Which was to produce &quot;sky to water&quot; ( Blue ) invisibility, which did work intially, but but went horroribly wrong, possibly FROM mis-calculation, as they believed that they had bent light only but in fact had created a Space/Time distortion ( Gravity Scalar Wave ),<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; When was this event?<br />
 <br />
 brought on by their elemental understanding of Einstein's &quot;Theory of Relativity&quot; or his &quot;Special Relativity&quot; Theory, based on Gravitonics,as the graviton is not just one particle, a photon )( or Quanta ) but has a duality counter-part, a anti-photon ( or phonon, such as Fogal's CBT possesses ), such as matter has anti-matter, or to produce &quot;super conductivity&quot; requires, theoritically &quot;Cooper pairing&quot;, as the universal constant, as Greg has stated exsist as &quot;Steady State&quot; Physics shows, there is no &quot;Big Bang&quot;, sorry Hawkins, an Kiku ( &quot;String Theory&quot; ). <br />
 <br />
Our numerous experiments has simply proven them wrong, with PPCM imperical proof, and the experiments with &quot;Wave Probagation&quot;, proving that SETI<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Please forgive my ignorance, or did I miss something, but what is SETI?<br />
 <br />
 is a big &quot;cosmic joke&quot; on both NASA and the US taxpayer ( it is now owned by MS Bill Gates and Paul Allen, now the &quot;Pheonix Project&quot; and SETI@Home ) as any advanced alien civilization, older than 500 to 1000 years would be using &quot;Gravity Bi~Wave&quot; to talk amongst the Stars, and these aliens would give their children the lesser &quot;low band&quot;, in the EM Hydrogen frequency, as we do with our children, crystal radios, CB, etc.<br />
 <br />
So if ET is out there he is not going to wait 200 years, or greater, between transmit and recieve ( 400 years ) to say &quot;hello&quot; and then &quot;Goodbye&quot;, as we are dealing with the speed of light ( 186,342.01 miles per sec or 300,000 meters per sec. ) and with that probagation you would not have much of a conversation, with ET, but Fogal's type of &quot;Phase Conjugate&quot; technology ( there is the Aspen device, also ) which, uniqually has no probagation ( 3d Space/Time ) delay, as we have demonstrated to both NASA and the military ( Augusta-Tech meeting, and I was there ) so they have known about this concept, but have never totally understood this Teslan function, PPCM.<br />
 <br />
Last, this was the &quot;Montauk Project&quot;, as I had said the result of the &quot;Philadelhia Experiment&quot; lesson, finally learned, with great harm to the Eldridge naval crew, our usual practice, like the atomic bomb exposure to our miltary, so what else is new, so what if those sailors got stuck in the bulkheads, its all for science sake, and if it drove the rest crazy, that is ok, they are only sailors, ya right.....<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Was that a fact? Is there credible and verifiable documentation to corroborate that and anything that is published about either Philadelphia or Montauk? <br />

 <br />
If, you desire to continue, I will be glad to respond, but remember, the Internet has cyber eyes and ears ( FBI &quot; the dreaded &quot;C&quot; ) also you may find extra information at the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fbi.gov</a> and look in their archieve under Tesla, they just released about 6 Meg Bytes of confiscated documents, released by the &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot;, so called &quot;Open Records&quot; Act.<br />
 <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; No doubt I have been marked already, especially if, as I suspect there is some direct connection between some of my current distresses and any of these previous &quot;never happened&quot; covert operations..<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Another question for you to. In my browsing countless pages on the www about Montauk and other related topics, it was suggested that the hundreds of cell phone transmission and relay towers that are see envery, but like sentinels in the scores around every major city in North America, alre also a part of the ongoing mind control efforts of either the government or other rogue organizations and agencies. Can you enlighten at all on this topic. I have had rigning in my ears since I was about nine year of age, which has been accredited to an ear injury where one of my ear drums was punctured by aloud noise. In recent days since I have been digging INTO these things, the rigning is becoming louder, and occasionally even overbearing such as accoustic feedback, and this has happened several times in the past 10 -12 years under certain situations.<br />
 <br />
~You can either stay on the course you have taken already, as the damage has been done...so you have nothing to loss, or you can just float...either way the &quot;bad guys&quot; have lost....we just have to fix the mess that has been left, and I have a way of helping you with your &quot;Inter~phase&quot; disease ( DOR ), so I will get back to you soon....<br />

<br />
I am most curious y'all. In one of the posts in this toipic area before I began my digging more deeply INTO the Montauk Project there was a modicum of expressed interest concerning these things. Are any of you doing any personal research and finding things that we all would benefit FROM sharing.<br />
 Is there anyone in this GROUP who has been near the Montauk site during the time the projects was in opetation? This is the entire crux of my feverish searching for factual and crdible information, the fact that I visited Montauk Point twice in the late 1960's between the ages of eight and nine, while this prject was really hot. I am told by another associate in this research that anyone who was there while the experiments were ongoing, would have risked exposure to the Deadly Orgonic RF Emissions fronm the antennae arrays that were there, as well as FROM the photonic light emissions FROM the Montauk Light House, which was also a part of those experiments howbeit not mentioned in the Nichols / Monn books that I have read so far, as I recall.<br />
 I don't know if KGLW's Larry Jamison is in fact going to the Bay Area UFO Expo next month since the last I heard they didn't have tickets yet. Al Bileck I gong to be there for a reare interview. Anyone here FROM the Bay area?&lt;hr size=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; color=&quot;#000099&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Mr. Daniel E. Lauirer<br />

Dave,<br />
 I have noticed a very interesting thing. Regardless of how much information is posted about a subject being discussed, almost invariably, sooner or later it always gets dragged back around to the participants in the boards discussing each other, and soon offending each other, then there is no discussion, only flaring exchanges of opinion and temperment one about the other.<br />
For this reason, I will not further describe or dicuss myself in any deatil, until I can verify my suspicions concerning what has happened in my past, and may still be occuring in my present continuous, which I have the means to do over time when the Montauk Insider I am corresponding with has time FROM his personal business to assist me further.<br />

I see what you mean Zxavier I am a psychic and I can certainly see that you shouldnt want to get tangled in that mesh! <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;until I can verify my suspicions concerning what has happened in my past, and may still be occuring in my present continuous,&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Well I see that there is a bit of mistrust and motive on your behalf. Maybe you should inform the other posters who you really are, and your plans Mr. Lauirer? <br />
<br />
So you say.</div>

By all means, please inform everyone of your speculations, and by all means do it publicly. I have no ulterior motives, do you? I am here only to research, share and glean infomration on the topics at hand. So far, to my understanding you are the only one who is finding any fault with my so doing.<br />
<br />
If you have something factual and pertinent to the topic at hand that is a connection I am looking for, please feel free to share it. If any more needs be said concerning your verbal afront, the moderator may need say it since that is not may place nor reason for being here, as I have said.<br />

<br />
Dear Montauk Project Enthusiasts,<br />
<br />
 In today's E-Mail was a personal response FROM Preston Nichols, one of the insiders, who along with author Peter Moon, have authored at least four books on the topic of the Montauk Project. In response to my request fopr more information, he as invited me to call him by phone, giving the correct number to call. That, y'all, FROM what I understand of Nichols and Moon FROM others who have tried without response or assistance, dosn't happen very often, ideed, I got the brush off FROM Peter in early 1998 when I Snail Mailed them at their publishing company. I'll do my best to keep you posted if I do get in touch with Preston before Friday evening and there is anything he can and will share with me that is new or different.<br />

Language Of Hyperspace Tapes<br />
Posted: Oct. 31, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been using the frankincense to help with pineal abilities. When I forget I have more difficulties seeing my chakras spinning and placing the protection bubble around the house at night. (I don't spin my chakras at night, just make sure they are all correct.)<br />
<br />
I most want to thank you for the pineal exercises you give on Tape 3, I believe it is, on the &quot;Language of Hyperspace&quot; set. Seeing them sketched out, as well as explained, is hugely helpful. I have already started using them a little, and hope â€“ no, will â€“ improve with practice.<br />
<br />
To all out there reading this, the tape sets are definitely worth it. The amount of DATA in them is phenomenal. I would like to pick out some examples, but the list just keeps growing â€“ and I'm only thinking of the &quot;Language of Hyperspace&quot; tapes, which are not the only ones I have. Do whatever it takes to get these tapes; so very much is explained!<br />
<br />
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! â€“Frances<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Thank you as well!! Glad that I can be of service. Let me know how it goes.<br />

Warrior Frequency<br />
Posted: Oct. 30, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello! My mom sent me your site today and I checked it out for the first time. I find myself very enlightened, as I always knew that there was something bigger going on. I am in the military, but have always believed it was to learn the skills needed for what is about to transpire. I have always felt my spirit has been a warrior sense its existence. I have always had visions of leading a large GROUP of people out of darkness and to safety INTO the Rockies. Never have understood the meaning. My mom gave me a Moldavite Stone one year fastened in silver, and I attached an Indian Arrowhead to it with a crystal. It helps me with prayer and clarity. I was called a Point of Light once, but not sure what the messenger was trying to tell me. I find that if I am near a college campus, all of those people thinking at once rattles my brain and gives me a headache. I have always been able to sense other people's emotions and even read their thoughts. My mind is strong and my sensitivity high. The sixth sense I possess is uncanny and when I am in the woods, I become one with nature. I believe in your thoughts, I am need of more educationing. Any thoughts you could provide me with on what I have mentioned, I would appreciate. I have also received four anthrax shots FROM the Army, do I need fear? I have been to SERE School, and was very resistant to the pressures to conform and was considered mentally impenetrable. â€“EJ Snyder<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: There are many out there like you who are on a warrior frequency. The time is coming soon when you will be activated to perform your functions. It may not necessarily be physically oriented, but may have to do with helping people to mentally handle what is occurring. It must be very difficult to be in the military at this time. The things they are telling you are not true. You must discern for yourself. Apply what you know in a positive way.<br />

Divine Intervention, Free Will<br />
Posted: Oct. 30, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
What will come after if the world economy collapses completely, life in concentration camps? I know what you are saying about mind patterns, but I don't think we can change our reality just by HAVING certain mind patterns. This is New Age disinformation that has been spread by intelligence agencies so that they can go about their disgusting affairs without being disturbed. I believe it works on a collective level, while on the individual level we can only make this reality less painful if the majority is still led around like the sheeple that they are.<br />
<br />
I don't think their plans will be allowed to happen fully, there will be &quot;divine&quot; intervention of some sort. God allows free will but only to see who will choose evil and who will not. There is simply no way that the world can fight the Illuminati when they have access to time manipulation technologies. The vast majority of people don't even believe time travel is possible. All of this goes back to the Lucifer Rebellion and how this entity has hijacked creation by shutting off human awareness through reincarnation cycles. Al Bielek said that the Illuminati time machines will stop working in 2003 because they are based on an &quot;artificial time rift&quot;. That's probably why they want complete control by 2003. I believe that year will be the beginning of the end, up until around 2013 where this galactic cycle will end and those who chose right will be freed FROM this fallen universe.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: I do disagree with your perception. Mind-pattern is everything. God-Mind does not interfere but allows free will. There are alternate realities where these things did not occur, so all solutions are already in existence. It is a matter of realizing them. That is up to each individual who will then affect the collective mind.<br />

Rosicrucian Order<br />
Posted: Oct. 30, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I wrote to ask about this symbols...I was once a student of the Rosicrucian ORDER and I never knew their teaching and rituals were connected to the Illuminati. But yesterday I was burning all my past teaching of them and in the pile of papers FROM them I found a letter I had not read. Now I was in the 9th degree of their teachings. In the letter it stated that now that I was 9th degree I would be allowed in the Illuminati. I have this letter in case anyone wishes to see it. I never sent the letter back stating I wanted to do that. But all the discourse had a ritual with them. I was 23 years in the order. Been ten years since I was in there and now I am seeing clearly what they were preparing me for. What a strange world..We never really know.<br />

Acceptance, Children Sleeping<br />
Posted: Oct. 30, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I find your website fascinating. While I am very new to most of the information you talk about â€“ I am keeping an open mind and working with the Healer's Handbook, the first of Janet's trilogy on Finding Self and soon her childrens books. I can accept and practice the changing your mind pattern info, but am really skeptical and mind blown by the Reptilian, UFO/alien and Illuminati info. You encourage checking this out for yourself â€“ this seems like an awesome endeavor and would require understanding of physics and genetics â€“ would it not? With two small children, I have barely enough time to practice meditation and visualization. Is it necessary to accept the so called conspiracy info? If not, would one still be able to protect oneself and ones family? Three more questions â€“ what are your feelings about Thich Nhat Hanh, the Buddhist monk who teaches mindfulness? Also, Edgar Cayce, who was an early influence for me. And, what are your thoughts about children sleeping with parents â€“ we enjoy this as a family, and we all sleep well this way, but I wonder if this does not give them enough space for their dreams. Thank you for sharing your work, it is helping me understand, cope and have hope during these challenging times.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: You must accept or reject whatever you wish. No knowledge is mandatory. It is up to the individual. No great scientific understanding is necessary. The information is straight forward. The protection techniques in my &quot;Healer's Handbook&quot; will work no matter what you believe. As for your other questions, I do not support the work of any religiously oriented GROUP or individual.<br />
<br />
Edgar Cayce communicated with his own Oversoul. However, the timeline has been split since he gave his readings, rendering his predictions invalid at this point.<br />
<br />
Children should not sleep with their parents. This will lead to many psychological problems when they are adults. There will be difficulties in sexuality and relationships. The parents must ask themselves why they need their children to sleep with them. Seems like some unhealthy co-dependency issues.<br />

Fear<br />
Posted: Oct. 30, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
On your suggestion on food, water and money. So after the several weeks would everything go back to normal? If I have food and water and everything else in my town is contaminated and traveling is out of the question why would I need money? Do we basically go to the Y2K preparedness? I am enjoying life now so much, after reading all of David Ickes books and then came upon your website in the past 2 months, I have read 1 of your books. I hunger so much for more knowledge that I get so disappointed in all this that is going on. Because I desire to read all of your books without distractions. After spending ALOT of time and money on Y2K I do not want to make this mistake again. You and your wife now have an insight INTO all this, tell us, your readers how will you prepare. Pretend we are children and give us a step by step suggestion. Thank you very much.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: All the information that you are asking is all on the website. My work is to provide you with the information that I know. What you do with it is up to you. You worry too much. This attracts more problems to you. Stop it! Nothing is &quot;normal&quot; anymore. It never will be again. Y2K was a scam. So is what is happening now. They are both setups. That is the whole point. All the events on this planet are showing everyone to take responsibility for his/her own self, and not to listen to others. Do what your heart and mind tell you. Go on without fear. Create your world. Read Janet's articles, &quot;All Experience is Neutral...Even NWO Agendas and Alien Invasions&quot; and &quot;Is Your Reaction Fear?&quot;<br />

Weight Loss<br />

On 10/25/01 you gave someone some instructions about losing weight. Would that apply to anyone?<br />

Muslims<br />
Posted: Oct. 30, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do 'they' want to eliminate Muslims and why did 'they' permit them in the first place.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Very lengthy discussionâ€“which I have written about extensively. The Fundamentalists do not conform to the Illuminati agenda. They permitted various religious &quot;projects&quot; to determine the best control setup. Terrorism was an Illuminati creation to instill fear in the public. Fear makes people more controllable.<br />

Sources<br />
Posted: Oct. 30, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I found your website after reading Montauk â€“ The Alien Connection and then ordered a personality profile and videos. I was very impressed with the profile's accuracy and Stewart gained much credibility in my eyes FROM that.<br />
<br />
In the past I have been influenced by several authors and sources including Neale Donald Walsch. I saw in the guestbook that you wrote he is a member of the Illuminati-controlled Theosophical Society. Now I am questioning my other past sources of inspiration. Do you have any opinion or knowing about:<br />
<br />

I strive to use my own discernment in recognizing tools useful for my advancement/improved state of being and happiness. Some I have stayed with longer than others. I am curious what you have to say about the above sources and authors. â€“fldj_55@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
Stewart: I do not generally critique others unless I am asked, and only if these sources are dangerous to the mind-pattern.<br />

Symbols<br />
Posted: Oct. 30, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
This is interesting. Does this mean if we focus on these symbols we are connecting to the Illuminati agenda?<br />
<br />
The secret societies and the Illuminati believe in the power of symbols. The world is full of their magical and black magic symbols. The problem is, we are so used to seeing them all over the place, that we don't even think about it. The Illuminati believe that the more symbols around, the more magical power to them. The insignia of the Illuminati and the New World ORDER is the &quot;Pyramid with the All-Seeing-Eye&quot;, which you can study on the back of the US One Dollar Bill(!) A few years ago this symbol was also on a series of stamps coming FROM the Vatican(!) The All-Seeing-Eye is the Eye of Horus, which is the Eye of Lucifer, and goes back to the Egyptian era. Other common symbols are the pentagram (five-pointed star), the hexagram (six-pointed star â€“ The Star of David), the Swastika reversed (the way Hitler used it) and the pyramid in general.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: You are correct. I write about this in my new books which will be available before the end of the year.<br />

Data Stream<br />
Posted: Oct. 30, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Last week while awaking FROM sleep, at the point of theta state, I received a huge download of symbol information coming INTO my field FROM the top of my head. I opened my eyes which is when I realized I was viewing a stream of very elaborate symbols that were rapidly streaming INTO me. Some of the symbols I recognized as astrologic/planetary and such. The next morning, upon awakening again, I realized that I had just gotten another connection regarding the symbols and their relevance, plus an index of sorts for their meanings. I would very much appreciate your thoughts on what has occurred recently to me. I'm not sure how to or if I should enhance/access this info. I am a energy practitioner and I was wondering what the significance of this download of info means to me in the future and can you please address this and enlighten me???? Do you know about the language of light FROM SSOA? Can you address those symbols, are they valid? The meanings I get FROM some of the planetary meanings are different FROM the ones I've read in books. I would appreciate your attention to these questions.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Either you received an artificial activation, or you were activated FROM within your own Kundalini energy. You will have to decide this for yourself. You might also want to look through my &quot;Healer's Handbook&quot; to see if you recognize any of these symbols. This is as far as I can go with the information that you have provided.<br />

Pets<br />
Posted: Oct. 30, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Since everything around one reflects some aspect of oneself, this would extend to pets? If a pet has a &quot;problem&quot; or illness, is that also a reflection of something in the owner's mind-pattern? Which owner (husband, wife, other family members)?<br />
<br />
Stewart: Yes, pets do reflect their owner's mind-patterns. I have seen many cases where a pet took on its master's illness. It depends on which owner is the closest to the pet.<br />
<br />
Seems a petty question, I know. Just lately my biggest difficulties in life seem to be still can't see my T-bar, and physical problems of 2 of our 5 pets (one a male cat, one a female dog). <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> â€“Frances<br />

Stewart: These are separate issues. You should be looking at your own physical problems before you look at the pets. Try using frankincense oil to open up the pineal. Thank you for your continuing support.<br />

Have just read something interesting that you may find interesting. Seems that the AFRL in New Mexico have been testing a microwave beam on 'volunteers', with the reason being stated as a means of 'crowd control'.

Mind-Patterns<br />
Posted: Oct. 29, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm still confused. If I have the correct mind pattern (i.e., that no harm will come to me), I will be safe no matter what the Illuminati have planned for this country/world? I'll be free of their slavery plans and able to live my life the way I envision, with no interference FROM them? I'll be able to have pure water and grow my own organic food, using my composter, and live happily ever after? Just double-checking â€“ I'm working on it.... <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> Cheri<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: If you totally release all of the victimization mind-patterns that you have, then there cannot possibly any negative effects on your life. The worse thing to have is fear. Confusion is second worse.<br />

ELF Transmissions<br />
Posted: Oct. 29, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
hello, mr.swerdlow. thanks for sharing your information to us people. you said that between two and four a.m. they are bombarding us with ELF transmissions. this is EXACTLY what i've been observing (due to my shiftwork) in germany for three years now. sometimes it felt like a vibration, sometimes like a deep bass sound more to be felt than heard and sometimes there was only a very strong feeling of fear. all of these experiences were ALWAYS in the timeframe you were mentioning. three years ago i was living five minutes away FROM where i now live and this did never happen there. this place was besides a river. could this somehow be connected with the water?<br />
<br />
another thing on my mind is the triangle-shaped ufo(?) i saw five months ago. it appeared and vanished, and it looked like the stealth-techniques in star trek HAVING trouble. it headed towards a big us-army base near the city where i live. it was very big, i cannot compare its size to any known vehicle i ever saw. it had a very dark, brownish color and you could more feel than hear a deep summing, but maybe two minutes BEFORE it flew by. but i think this was connected. it had the same vibe of strangeness as the object. why would such big objects fly to us-army bases? who is flying this? what is its cargo? it looked like it could transport THOUSANDS of beings.<br />
<br />
this whole montauk-programming-illuminati-awareness started (for me) when hale-bopp passed by. i was dreaming about reptilians and time machines and ufos at that time. almost a year later i then read about the same things in the first montauk-book. i've since then read anything about montauk so far. so i came to your site a year ago, and then the noose tightened. this year i was &quot;hunted&quot; by ufos all summer long (at night when i was outside alone), shortly after i asked you questions about the word gelgam which i dreamed years ago. you said this is a mixed anagram of gemgal, a code word for the monarch sex slaves and this could mean involvement in montauk-type projects. how can i research further INTO this? and do you know if project malta in strasbourg is still running? thanks for your time and help. â€“thevoid@gmx.net<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Thank you for sharing your comments. Water does act as an amplifier for ELF transmissions. This is why the sensations would be stronger near larger bodies of water.<br />
<br />
The triangular craft that you see are built on this planet by human technology. They are basically fighter craft and troop transport and are based throughout Europe and North America. They have interstellar capability. My new book will be released by the end of the year and will answer the questions you have about the projects and the programming.<br />

Spiritual School Of Ascension<br />
Posted: Oct. 29, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I gotta give you a lot of credit Stewart! I consider myself pretty well informed about the Illuminati agenda, galactic history, etc., as well as I have spent many years learning how to clear myself of outdated &quot;mind patterns&quot; and to create my life deliberately through conscious Intention. It's not easy to rock my boat, nor have I been that challenged by most things I have explored over the last year due to what I have learned so far. Well, congratulations, you (and Janet's articles) have definitely stretched me with what you are presenting! I've looked through most of your website, and just received the &quot;Healer's Handbook&quot; plus the &quot;You and your DNA&quot; video set (which I just finished watching today).<br />
<br />
What I would like is to get your comments on is information FROM the SSOA (Spiritual School of Ascension) website: <a href="http://www.ascendpress.org" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">www.ascendpress.org</a> and the Language of Light symbols they use in their work. I came across this just about two years ago and felt a deep resonance within me when I starting reading their material and doing the clearing techniques they use to release &quot;karmic patterns&quot; (like your mind-patterns) through Intention for the purposes of embodying the Soul through anchoring more strands of DNA. FROM their point of view &quot;consciousness is biological&quot; so to be able to maintain full consciousness while in the body requires the full 12 strands of DNA to be present and operational. Their version of a fully conscious human is very much the same as you describe it in your DNA video. Even though I had a &quot;falling out&quot; with SSOA shortly after choosing to study their program (that's a story in and of itself), I have found value in their approach. As a result I have noticed a definite improvement in my own mastery of Self along the lines you and Janet describe in your materials, in that I am the Creator of my life, and I take full accountability for what I am experiencing. However, I do admit I don't have the facility of access to the Oversoul in the way you are promoting. I did have the experience two years ago of knowing my Self as the Creator or Source of my being, where I was &quot;IT.&quot; Since then, information/guidance comes as a &quot;knowing,&quot; and not FROM anyone else, even an &quot;Oversoul&quot; as far as I can tell. I will CHECK this out for myself through your techniques as well, and I would like your comments about this one thing: Is SSOA on the money, or is it also another satellite transmission FROM the Illuminati? Also, when is your new book coming out Stewart?<br />
<br />
Thank you both for your clarity and the integrity of your information. â€“Jim Granger<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Thank you for sharing your experience with us. Thank you for your very wonderful comments. Bottom line is, any organization or person that promotes the 12 strand DNA disinformation is either connected to satellites or completely mind-controlled. Either way it is not a pretty picture. My new book is planned for release by the end of the year. Information will be posted on the website.<br />

Arab Hijackers<br />
Posted: Oct. 29, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT, you have surprised me now, you just said, &quot;The recent Arab hijackers spent much time in Prague.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was convinced there were no hijackers on the aircraft, (i.e. â€“ remote controlled through IFF technology) and also that the towers collapsed through internal explosions.<br />
<br />
In other words, it was engineered through the US govt/Illuminati.<br />
<br />
I thought it was all so obvious... now I'm really confused :-(<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Yes, there really were Arab hijackersâ€“people called FROM the plane to tell about them, but they were mind-controlled and programmed.<br />

Vatican<br />
Posted: Oct. 28, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is it that the Vatican is in all areas of religion, politics, etc.? They play the part of unity and peace, but they are so dark. Why did the Pope go to China? Why have they not been struck down by the Creator for their lies? Are they, including the Pope, reptilian? Like I once heard, there is no hope in the Pope. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: This is discussed extensively on the website and in my books. The Vatican is an arm of the Illuminati. They are creating a New World Religion based on Christianity, so the Pope goes all over the world to promote a Christian image. The Creator, as you put it, allows free will and all things. God is neutral, contrary to what you have been taught.<br />

Circumcision<br />
Posted: Oct. 28, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
You had mentioned UUN in your video being symbolic â€“ if you see this in a writing does it have significance?<br />
<br />
Stewart: Do you mean UN or UUN? What is the contest to which you are referring?<br />
<br />
You had mentioned everything being symbolic in the video â€“ therefore (here's a sensitive topic in the 20th century â€“ circumcision). Why is this done and for what benefit â€“ if not religious means? And why specifically Moslems and Jews?<br />
<br />
Stewart: Uncircumcised genitals are Reptilian-like. The ancient Hebrews did it to remove themselves symbolically FROM Reptilian images. The Moslems base their religion on Judaism.<br />

Wingmakers<br />
Posted: Oct. 28, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Joe Champion has stated that Prof. Albert (Alexej) Ignatenko is the man who created the Wingmakers and his team developed all the material within the Wingmakers site/music/philosophy etc..<br />
<br />
The background on this guy is truly incredible. â€“ A small description follows...<br />
<br />
The Vice-President of the World Information Distribution University, the President of the Czech Academy of Informatiology, the Academician of the five Academies, Doctor and Grand Doctor of Energy and Information Sciences, full Professor. Academician Ignatenko is an active public figure, widely known in the world, the founder of the new scientific trends such as Cosmopsychoenergysuggestology, Cosmoenyopsychology, Cosmoenyoufology, Cosmoenyomedicine, Cosmoenyoarts, Cosmoenyopedagogics, Cosmoenyosports. The scientist-practitioner prepared more than 16000 specialists, who successfully work in many countries of the world and apply his sciences in all the spheres of activities, promoting the embodiment of the author's project: &quot;THE PREPARATION OF THE GOLDEN AGE MAN-THE ECOLOGY OF THE SOUL, THE EARTH AND THE SPACE&quot;.<br />
<br />
(For more details click <a href="http://www.transmutation.com/personnel.html#" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.transmutation.com/personnel.html#</a> then SELECT Nataliya Dobrova, then click 'Life School' to bring a pop up window with photo of Professor and his extensive background).<br />
<br />
Stewart, can you understand why Joe Champion is announcing that Prof. Ignatenko is the creator of the Wingmakers material? What is the 'connection' here? i.e. - Are they both 'connected' to the same source, or what are their intentions regarding the Wingmakers material.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: I think you already know the answer to that. By setting up this person as the Wingmakers creator, it discredits the true information. It all sounds New Agey to me, and highly suspicious. The Czech Republic has long been a center for mind-control and experiments. The recent Arab hijackers spent much time in Prague.<br />

Thresher &amp; Scorpion<br />
Posted: Oct. 28, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder if you can answer a question that has been bugging me for some years now? Your knowledge astounds me and I feel sure you will know the true answer. Can you tell me what really happened to the submarine's 'Thresher' and 'Scorpion'? Also can you suggest any connections between those events and the more recent Russian submarine accident? *** Many thanks to you and Janet, for sharing your insights and advice so freely with others <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> â€“Be Free<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Very interesting question. I believe these subs were lost in 1968 or so. Actually, three subs were lost, one after the other that year. The first was an Israeli submarine named Dakar, in the eastern Mediterranean. A short time later, the French submarine, Minerve, was lost in the western Mediterranean. Finally, the American submarine, Scorpion, was missing in the Eastern Atlantic. No wreckage or bodies were ever found. These subs encountered craft FROM secret undersea installations that were finishing tunneling FROM the Caribbean trench to the Middle East. The French and Israeli governments, then not under total Illuminati control, sent out subs to monitor the activity. These were destroyed so as not to reveal what was seen. The Americans then destroyed their own sub to make it look like they, too, were victims of some unknown event. This is also one of the reasons that the Israelis attacked the USS Liberty in the Mediterranean. The Russian sub, Kursk, encountered activity at the North Pole entrance to the inner Earth that was not supposed to be seen. You know the rest. Thanks for jogging my memory of that forgotten incident.<br />

Time Machines<br />
Posted: Oct. 28, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I apologise for the length of this email, but felt it necessary to provide sufficient information for you to recognise the importance.<br />
<br />
I was introduced to a fascinating website tonight, 'Trasmutation.com', which appears to have a genuine purpose... &quot;It is the desire of all involved that we share this site to the betterment of Humankind.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, through reading your comments on the NWO and understanding a little of the background to the Philadelphia Experiment, Montauk, etc., I am a little concerned for these people and their genuine intentions.<br />
<br />
I remember your warnings regarding developing 'time machines' and something to the effect that 'THEY' are made aware if someone develops the technology by 'signals broadcast' (or whatever means).<br />
<br />
Also interestingly, he confirms much of what you said regarding The Wingmakers and has an announcement on the home page, that discloses the Wingmakers author and subliminal intentions...<br />
<br />
This will ONLY be available to read, for THREE DAYS.<br />
<br />
I hope this email explains my purpose and thank you for your time. With best wishes to yourself and Janet for continued success and good health.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Thank you for the information. In light of this person's background and connections, which I believe he still has, this sounds like a &quot;program magnet.&quot; That means this website and information were designed to attract those who would be involved in devices and mechanations in ORDER to counter the Illuminati. Bottom lineâ€“this looks like a trap, or &quot;spider's web.&quot; The information may be true, but what they are saying could not happen without the government blessings. It would be considered a threat to national security. Thanks for sharing and for your support.<br />

Economy, Preparations<br />
Posted: Oct. 28, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I still find most of the information regarding various alien races and their influences on us earthlings a little too &quot;out there&quot;. But your spiritual and practical advice resonates true to me. Thank you for being so dedicated to helping us stay &quot;individualized&quot; and strong.<br />
<br />
Stewart: You are welcome.<br />
<br />
It is difficult to read even the headlines or top stories and then get on with the day and it's usual activities, particularly in the work arena. Would it be better to just read the jokes, recipes and horoscope and then get on with the day? I don't really think ignorance is bliss but the bombardment of negativity leaves me limp sometimes.<br />
<br />
Stewart: Each person must know him/herself. If the news upsets you, watch something else.<br />
<br />
Do you think the stock market will recover in a year or two? ever? Is that little ride for wealth over? Should one just keep their greenbacks under the mattress, buy gold or silver coins, invest in land for growing food?<br />
<br />
Stewart: I have stated numerous times, the economy is scheduled for failure. I would start with hard, tangible investments.<br />
<br />
What kind of preparations, if any, should we undertake ourselves, since we seem to have no national defense to counteract our national vulnerability? â€“Judith<br />
<br />
Stewart: Again, I have discussed this numerous times. ANALYZE and read just your own mind-pattern. There are no safe places, only safe people. Read Janet's article on the site, &quot;Keeping Your Children Safe...And You, Too!&quot; and &quot;Patriotism vs. Warmongering.&quot; There is no national defense because there is no longer a nation as people believe. There never has been.<br />

Visible Aliens<br />

<br />
You said that in 2003 the reptilians would be walking on earth but by 2009 aliens would be here. I thought the former ones were in charge. Who are the aliens &amp; why will they be here? Where are they FROM &amp; what do they look like? You have much info on all your sites that is very helpful to people.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: I have never written about 2009. I said that in 2003 the hybrid Illuminati will have completed their globalization of control and manipulation. By 2010 and beyond, interaction with other alien groups will be common under strict rules and regulations. The Illuminati hybrids are of Reptilian stock. All of this is explained in my forthcoming book, &quot;Blue Blood, True Blood: Conflict &amp; Creation.&quot;<br />

Wiretapping, Internet Monitoring<br />
Posted: Oct. 28, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
President Bush on Oct. 26 signed INTO law a measure giving law enforcement agencies expanded authority to wiretap telephones and examine Internet usage.<br />
<br />
The measure allows expanded surveillance of electronic mail, Internet and cell phone transmissions, rewriting laws that were first crafted in the era of rotary telephones. It will also extend the reach of federal search warrants, making them valid across all district and state lines. Previously, law enforcement officials were required to obtain a new warrant in different jurisdictions.<br />
<br />
What is your opinion of this new law and what do you think will be the implications of it in the U.S.?<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: I have already discussed this countless times on this website. It is another step toward the consolidation of the NWO and a global military dictatorship. First, there is the need to break the &quot;American Spirit&quot; so that US citizens feel no differently than a Nicaraguan or Vietnamese.<br />

Project Blue Beam Holograms<br />

<br />
<br />
The day after the WTC incident she saw a giant triangle in the sky that looked like it was formed out of cloud material but did not look like clouds. On each side of the triangle there was a diamond shaped rainbow! I wonder whose DNA they were triggering!!?!! This covered almost half the sky and occured over southern West Virginia. â€“Lynn Martin<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Thanks for sharing. No DNA is being triggered by this. It is simply a test of the holographic imaging and getting feedback FROM what they hear FROM the public. In 2002, probably in spring or summer, they will start to project alien ships or asteroids in the sky to promote fear and panic. Then the people will ask for a solution that they already planned to supply! Ingenious!<br />

Geometric Rainbows<br />
Posted: Oct. 27, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I have seen the pyramid shaped rainbow in the sky that Darleen and you saw. For many years I have been absolutely fascinated with these small sections of rainbows that would appear in the sky on the same side of the sky as the sun. I have seen them in many different geometric shapes through the years. Sometimes there would be two, one on each side of the sun. Several years ago I did some research and found that these were around hundreds of years ago. The Native Americans called them Sun Dogs because they traveled with the sun. The scientific explanation I have read is that it is the sunlight reflecting through the moisture in the clouds. I must admit I have never seen them in a cloudless sky. I have seen several in the last two weeks! â€“Lynn Martin<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Thanks for sharing. The double rainbow is merely a reflection of moisture in the atmosphere. However, the geometric shapes are something else. These forms have only been projected since the satellite technology was developed in the mid-70s. Regards FROM us all.<br />

Foreign Object, St. John's Wort<br />
Posted: Oct. 27, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
At around the age of four, my mother discovered a small, hard, spherical object behind my left ear, which I used to be able to move slightly. I suffer FROM constant high-pitched ringing in my ears (could be tinnitus) and have had several experiences of what can best be described as an entity aggressively trying to pull me out of my body, whilst I am paralysed with fear. This is preceded by a shivering sensation which washes over me. Have you any suggestions as to what may be happening? â€“Stacy Lambert<br />
<br />
Stewart: I have had the same experiences! This is usually the result of programming and implantation. When the device releases an ELF pulse, it affects the nervous system with the shivering or shuddering. Go to brown color when this happens and balance your T-Bar.<br />
<br />
Also, do you have any thoughts about the plant extract St John's Wort, which now seems to be pushed extensively by standard doctors. Are there any side effects in using it that you know of?<br />
<br />
Stewart: No side effects that I know of.<br />

T-Bar<br />
Posted: Oct. 27, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Stewart â€“ I really appreciate your website. I ordered the Healer's Handbook and was excited to read about the person who saw the ankh for his t-bar. I recently had the same experience. I see a very faint cross for my t-bar and was very surprised to have an ankh pop up and it was so very clear and colorful. It had been laying flat and just popped up in front of me. It was a mosaic ankh and had beautiful stone pieces on it. The most prominent stones that flashed at me were orange, gold and a beautiful blue color. I haven't seen it again and am now HAVING trouble seeing my t-bar and doing the visualizations. Do you have any suggestions? I am planning to ORDER some videos FROM you in the near future. Again, thank you.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: This means that you are in the process of closing off one set of DNA instructions (cross) and opening up a new set of sequences (ankh.) This is common either in an &quot;end of cycle&quot; or &quot;new beginning&quot; frequency. Just let it be, and soon one will be predominant and the other will fade away. This is common with people of mixed ancestry. Hope you enjoy the videos, and thank you for your support.<br />

Chakra Colors<br />
Posted: Oct. 25, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Aren't the chakra colors supposed to agree with the colors of the rainbow? In this case, indigo would be the correct color for the third eye chakra.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: You are thinking in New Age information!! The atmosphere is very different in the last century than the original, therefore, the refraction of light and colors is distorted. Use your own mind to &quot;see&quot; for yourself. By the way, the color scheme is not mine. This is what I see in people, and this is what the NWO/Illuminati/Gov't uses for themselves because it is accurate. I didn't make it that way. That's just the way it is.<br />

Mandatory Implants?<br />
Posted: Oct. 25, 2001<br />

<br />
In the near future when everyone is required to receive an implant, how will one go about not being influenced by them? I assume they will make it a necessity to get one (i.e. money transfers) so how will we be able to deflect any mind control?<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Implants may not be necessary. There are ELF transmissions focused enough to use the human brain itself as an implant device. Therefore, it once again becomes a matter of using protection techniques as well as self-mind-control.<br />

New Zealand, Cats<br />

Is there much &quot;going on&quot; here in New Zealand?..ELF, reptilians, underground bases etc. I have woken in the night to a loud buzzing type noise, that is somewhat unsettling but familiar at the same time. Have also had a couple of experiences of being totally aware, but unable to move (as in a coma). Also, do all felines have a high frequency? And do Maori, Samoan, Fijian, Tongan etc originate FROM Lemurians? â€“Meredith<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Yes, with other mixes of humanity. New Zealand is part of what is left of Lemuria. Yes, there is plenty of underground Reptilian activity there. Felines have alien genetics. They are &quot;programmed&quot; to spy on humans since ancient Egyptian days.<br />

Bible Code, Indonesia<br />
Posted: Oct. 25, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello again Stewart, could you please tell me, is the bible code for real &amp; if so who created it?<br />
<br />
Stewart: The Bible Code is real, despite writings to the contrary FROM some sources. It was created by the ET-level beings as a code for future possibilities. Too much for an email.<br />
<br />
Also, Indonesia has warned of severe reactions if the US continues it's bombing campaign during the Holy Muslim month, starting mid November, the US claims it will continue until it's goal is achieved, what is their agenda here? Will Indonesia get dragged INTO this too? â€“Martin<br />
<br />
Stewart: The goal is to eliminate Muslims. Indonesia is one of these countries. It is also part of a major entry point to the inner Earth. I would suspect that over the next 3 months, there will be war activity in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Myanmar.<br />

Howdy Stewart...I have a question for you ..Of something I saw the other day that has me puzzled...and I wondered if you knew what it could be...I was outside looking up at the beautiful scattered clouds and in the center of sky there was a partial left-handed pyramid rainbow, covered on right side with clouds...but the point of connection on left was very clear and colors were muted like a rainbow that was about to fade..I have seen double and even triple rainbows but never one shaped in form of pyramid with no continuation in the round as normal.. could you shed some light on what it was that I saw?...Thanks Blessings to all of you... â€“Darleen Pyatt<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Amazing! I actually saw this last week in Chicago! It is identical to what you described. Where was itâ€“what city? Apparently, this is a form of holographic imaging being tested by satellite transmissions. It is part of the Blue Beam Project I have discussed on this website. Any other readers have similar sightings??? Thanks for sharing.<br />

Bio-terrorism Vaccines<br />
Posted: Oct. 25, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I've seen talk on the news about a proposed &quot;mandatory vaccinations&quot; to combat the fear of bio terror. Would you personally get vaccinated?<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: No. I am sure that there is more in that vaccination than what they say.<br />

Changing T-Bar<br />
Posted: Oct. 25, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I was doing my balancing of T bar today and it has always been a T but today a huge I mean huge golden Ankh appeared. Then I did the meditation to find my personal antenna. It came out a royal blue star. Can you tell me what this means. Why is my T bar changing. I've been HAVING so many dreams. Been working on them to try and understand where I am.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: It is not unusual for the T-Bar archetype to change while you are doing daily work. If you have the genetics for the ankh, this is a possibility. Keep up the work. This is a sign of progress.<br />

Jack The Ripper<br />
Posted: Oct. 25, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I recently saw the new movie about Jack the Ripper. The theory in the movie was that Jack the Ripper was a free mason. FROM what I know about free masons it seems like a very ritualistic religion. I heard that George Bush and other presidents were also free masons. I wonder how/if this fits in with their reptilian background? Or if this has anything to do with the 9/11 attacks? â€“Steve<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Ritual and ceremony, including human sacrifice are part of Reptilian religion. The Masons are based on Reptilian philosophy and control systems.<br />

Weight Loss<br />
Posted: Oct. 25, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear Stewart, First of all I want to tell you that FROM the first moment I found your Web site and began reading that my soul resonated with your words. I believe you speak the truth. I ordered your Healers Handbook because I wanted to change my mind pattern concerning my weight. (I am presently 160 lbs above my ideal weight.) I have the book now and have been trying to find the Archetype to use for my specific need but cannot identify the one that would be most helpful to me. I have been &quot;insulating&quot; since I married at seventeen, thirty three years ago...no diets have helped as you say...for I must change my mind pattern. I need to do this because of my health so if you could tell me which Archetype to use with what colors, and which visualizations would benefit me the most I would be so grateful. Thank you for helping all of us &quot;see&quot;. Thank you for being &quot;You&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: There is no weight-loss archetype. The mind-pattern is one of insulation and protection against the world. I recommend doing the releasing altar on page 26 of my &quot;Healer's Handbook,&quot; especially with the male figures FROM childhood. Also, you might try taking 900-1000mg of wild yam root daily, as well as astragalus herb. Visualize a violet hose vacuuming the weight off of your body daily. Say the affirmation, &quot;I am now at my most perfect weight and appearance.&quot; Let me know how it goes.<br />

Is there a place in the galaxy called the Trentities? â€“Russ<br />

Stewart's Reply: Never heard of this before, but it translates to a numerical value of &quot;the 30s&quot; â€“this could be a programming code.<br />

Lyraens<br />
Posted: Oct. 25, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I was wondering how much a genetically pure human (Lyraen?) would differ physically FROM us, with our genetic mix? For instance bone structure, skin, eyes, hair etc...<br />
<br />
Stewart: They are much taller, very fair-skinned with almost electric blue eyes. They have blond or red hair.<br />
<br />
Also, are the Lyraen refugees here planning to challenge the reptilian backed faction of the Illuminati? Are these Lyraens holed up under the ice with the 4th Reich group?<br />
<br />
Stewart: There are no Lyraen refugees here per se; only the hybrid descendents. The 4th Reich is aligned with Aldebaran.<br />
<br />
I think it's about time I ordered a copy of your Healer's Handbook. I look forward to the impending release of your next book also. â€“Nathan<br />
<br />
Stewart: Hope you enjoy it.<br />

Time Loop<br />
Posted: Oct. 24, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you subscribe to the theory that the earth is caught in a manufactured time loop? If so can you expand on this. â€“zenblade<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: No. There are many time-lines and branches. It occurs with every decision that is made. It relates to the mind-patterns. Technology influences, but the mind decides.<br />

Prescription Drugs<br />
Posted: Oct. 24, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
received your Healer's Handbook â€“ THANKS!!!! It's awesome!!! I'll be ordering the video shortly.<br />
<br />
I'd like your opinion on prescription drugs. I read in Fit for Life II that in the early 1900s, Carnegie and Rockefeller saw the potential billions to be made with them and had all of the holistic colleges shut down, replacing them with colleges that only taught drug and surgery therapies, which just make us sicker (deliberately) so they can make more money, etc...<br />
<br />
My understanding is the drug companies take a natural ingredient, like an herb, and EXTRACT the piece that cures the applicable illness so they can patent it, since you can't patent anything natural. A woman who spoke at our DoD agency yesterday on holistic medicine (!!!) said that it started around 1950 with the AMA, and that they use the complete herb and ADD things to it like petroleum so they can patent their ridiculous drugs. Do you have any further insight INTO this? My credibility with the sheople is once again in jeopardy, even though the majority of what she said was stuff I've been &quot;teaching&quot; them for years and they thought that was great. Once again, help! and many thanks! â€“Cheri<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Glad you are enjoying the Healer's Handbook. Your basic information on prescription drugs is correct.<br />

Chakra Colors, Dome Of The Rock<br />
Posted: Oct. 24, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I know FROM my reading with you that you see the throat chakra as ice blue and the third eye chakra as royal blue. Why do some clairvoyants see the throat chakra as more of a sapphire blue and the third eye chakra as indigo? Some of the clairvoyants who see those colors are accurate in their readings, so I'm wondering why the discrepancy (an example is Rosalyn Bruyere, who has been scientifically tested; I also know some people who studied with her who have said she's very accurate in her readings).<br />
<br />
Stewart: The colors you mention are part of government programming. Perhaps this person's abilities are generated by this. Also, these colors often appear in chakras, but are not the original.<br />
<br />
I also thought you might be interested in this little nugget. A friend of mine recently heard a Sufi teacher speak who lives in Jerusalem. The Sufi teacher says that several years ago, the Israelis started advancing on the Dome of the Rock with tanks and bulldozers to knock it down. Some unarmed Muslims formed a chain around the Dome, and then the Mossad started shooting. There were some fatalities. Some of the Jewish members of the Sufi speaker's audience had a hard time believing this, but he said he witnessed it with his own eyes.<br />
<br />
Stewart: Probably true.<br />
<br />
Just goes to SHOW you that not everything is reported in the mainstream news media. It also lends credence to your theory that the Dome of the Rock is targeted for destruction.<br />
<br />
I must say that I keep trying to prove your predictions about world events wrong, but so far you've kept me on my toes!<br />
<br />
Stewart: Keep trying.<br />

Weather<br />
Posted: Oct. 24, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm able to change the weather with my thoughts. I don't know how/why I'm able to do this â€“ I just decide, and the weather changes (locally or nationally or globally). Do you have any thoughts on how/why I'm able to do this, and whether or not it is a wise thing to do? Thank you.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Weather is a function of the emotional gestalt of the people in an area. If you adapt to the overall mind-pattern, then you think you are changing the weather. You may be picking up the changes mentally and think you are doing it. One individual cannot change global weather.<br />

Creativity<br />
Posted: Oct. 23, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
What exercises do you feel can help develop creativity and bring it to life. Example: I write script. People like it. It ends there. How do I change the pattern of creating a quality script that just gathers dust? What was I doing the last, and only time I produced something? What was it about my mind pattern that created that experience?<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: To develop creativity and enhance it, you need to work on the right-brain. These exercises are listed in my Healer's Handbookâ€“read them! If you accomplish something before and are not able to recreate it, the mind-pattern is one of fear of success. You identify so deeply with failure that when you have success it frightens you because you do not know who you are.<br />

General Comments<br />
Posted: Oct. 23, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
I have some comments on the website. You provide a wealth of useful information on it. On the one side there is the info to understand what's going on in the world, and on the other there are the techniques and tips you can use to grow, heal and understand oneself. Besides you are keeping the whole website continuously up to date. I see that you both put a lot of work INTO the site. Answering questions, writing updates, articles and tips (daily) is a lot of work. All what you need in these times is all somewhere on the website. For free. Thank you!<br />
<br />
Maybe you want to hear about my progress <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> I meanwhile can visualize a little better than some months ago. I still do not get always the clear vision of the colors, but I feel that I am making progress. When I am using royal blue at the pineal gland, sometimes a light, but not unpleasant pressure is occurring within my head. At one time I doze off for twenty minutes. This night, shortly before I fell INTO sleep, I heard noises like when you use a modem to dial INTO another computer across the telephone line. After that I popped out of the body. I just want to ask if this was due to ELF, because of the strange sounds. It was not unpleasant. I felt protected. And I use your protection techniques. This just happened, I did not aim at it.<br />
<br />
On three occasions in the last two months I got very dizzy without reason. I normally do not get dizzy. Does this have to do something with the pineal gland? In this case (dizziness), does one use brown or violet ? <br />
<br />
I meanwhile watched some of your videos. You provide also a wealth of information there. It clarified some things in the Handbook and gave me additional information. I was glad to hear you speak there of the indigo children. I was always suspicious of them. Looks too much like another way to keep people thinking for themselves.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I cannot take part in the Swiss seminar this week. Maybe at another time.<br />
<br />
Keep care of your family and yourself!<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: Very often when the pineal gland is expanding it can create dizziness and headaches and even pressure. This is normal until it stabilizes. You may try using frankincense oil to help oxygenate this organ. Remember to always use brown to balance. Thank you for your very kind words. Look forward to someday meeting you.<br />

Who Is Working For Whom?<br />
Posted: Oct. 23, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Are the Illuminati working for the Draco that have been underneath the earth or the ones FROM the star system that have arrived on the ship behind the moon? You mentioned that the Draco star system are very upset with the reptilians on earth because they didn't intend for them to live here. What will the reptiles do to the ones on earth? Also, if the Illuminati plan to rule the earth themselves, how will the reptiles feel about this? I assume that they mean business with a huge ship and all. Wouldn't they plan a REAL takeover or some negative action if we don't comply? Just a few thoughts, thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: What I actually said was that the original Draco did not intend for the Illuminati to exist as such. They are not interested in hybrids. They want a Reptilian planet. So there is conflict between the two groups. Ultimately, one or the other has to be eliminated, but unfortunately, humans are in the middle. It is a thick plot. No one knows for sure how it will end up. I can only present the agendas which are unfortunately coming to pass. Things will get worse before they get better. As I have said a billion times, you can only work on your own mind-pattern.<br />

War Of The Worlds<br />

Apparently there's a remake of War of the Worlds that will be out on October 31st 2002. It is produced by a company named Pendragon (!) Pictures. I'm just HAVING difficulty believing this is a coincidence. It's to condition the public again? Sirians are not real aliens?<br />
<br />
Stewart's Reply: It is no coincidence. It is in preparation for a staged invasion. Yes, Sirians are real aliens.<br />

Flags, Jesus, 33<br />
Posted: Oct. 22, 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your prompt reply to my plea for help and advice re my acne rosacia problem. I'll seek out the various treatments that you recommended, and I'll keep in touch to let you know how I get on.<br />
<br />
Despite all that is going on in the world I'm finding these to be the most exiting days of my life, and I'm so grateful for the many things that are staring to take shape in my life.<br />
<br />
I've had problems with low self esteem for such a long time, and I've felt my confidence ebbing away with each successive year, but this year, and particular the period FROM this Summer up to now, has seen new light starting to break in on me, and finding your website has been a major contributing factor INTO that whole process.<br />
<br />
There's so much that I want to do with what remains of this year, and one of the top priorities is to ensure that I'm really staring to move forward with my hyperspace studies. One of the really interesting things that I've become aware of is the fact that I'm beginning to understand how to steady myself against what seem to be &quot;ebbs and flows&quot; or, perhaps more accurately, &quot;undulating currents of thought processes&quot; in my meditation times, and I'm finding that I'm better able to steady myself and continue now in situations where I would previously have broken my meditation off and given it up as a bad job. I hope that doesn't sound too vague, but its a very real thing that's been happening to me and the maintenance of control in that situation is proving to be a good and useful thing to learn.<br />
<br />
A couple of last things before I go. I couldn't help noticing a whole set of dragons very prominently displayed on one of the flags behind your President Bush when he made one of his mini- speeches on his current visit to China. I suppose we're going to see more and more of that sort of thing in the days and months to come aren't we? Also, I don't know if you keep up in any way with what's happening in the world of video and computer games, but one of the top selling games here in the UK in the past two or three years has been Spyro the Dragon, and the significance of that has only really dawned on me in these past few months. There's another new Spyro game due out early next year, maybe even in time for Christmas, and its not coincidence is it? I see it as a steady drip feed INTO the public consciousness at every level.<br />
<br />
And finally,something else just dawned on me this morning about Jesus, and more specifically about the age that he is alleged to have &quot;died&quot;, i.e. 33. Is that actually true, or are they just using more code here? I know that 33 is one of their big</div>

Now, isn't that a most interesting thing?  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />  Someone jumps on the train, wanting to derail it, and when given an open invitation to warp the tracks, he disappears as soon as he appeared?<br />
<br />
David Goodwin, whomever and what ever you are, I am quite interested to hear what you have to say against me.  Since I have no idea who you are, what your gripe is, or from whence you came, or with what condemnations, I would be excited to know, since it is doubtful you have anything new or different that isn't publicly available on the net, for the time being, but it wouldn't have any relevance herein currently.  No, if you have some insider information that would lend creedence to my personal investigations of connections with the Montauk Project and the stil  numerous and mostly unexplainable events in my past, please feel free to level your guns at me, I want and need to know, privately or publicly, if you can bear the pressure that may arise.<br />
<br />
Still digging,</div>

<br />
Dear friends and fellow researchers,<br />
<br />
     I am continuing with this research, with inputs coming from several locations.  Because of the extreme seinsitivity of these issues, I will only be sharing information with the advance permission of those providing it, and in most  cases guarding the name of those providing the information.     <br />
<br />
    If you have been within a fifty mile radius of Montauk Point, Long Island, NY between the early 1950's and mid-late 1980's, there is a possibility of you having been exposed to hazardous radio frequency or photonic light emissions, and that is only the beginning.  Most of those who were abuducted and used as test subjects, if they survived and were released back into society, would have little or no memories of what was done to them, and few of those who do remember want to tell.  It is important for the word to be gotten out to these people and their families, since the second and third generations of the Montauk Boys and others exposed are also likely to have residual effects no different than any others whose lives were experimented with, or were exposed to dangerous materials or radiation at any time.  This is the dirfection I am heading, to assist in locating people harmed by the Montauk Project itiself, and others like it having been conducted and being conducted presently, all around the world, and finding them help.<br />
<br />
     I am posting only in the Burlington News: <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/burlingtonnews/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/burlingtonnews/</a>, and Montauk: <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Montauk/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Montauk/</a>, News Groups of Yahoo Groups, as well as in the Montauk and the Philadelphia Experiment section at :<br />
<a href="http://www.timetravelinstitute.com/ttiforum/postlist.php?Cat=&amp;Board=montauk" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.timetravelinstitute.com/ttiforum/postlist.php?Cat=&amp;Board=montauk</a>, however, I welcome all Moderators, to all items I post in their newsgroups, unless I otherwise state in an individual message.<br />
<br />
     All of your inputs are most welcomed, encouraged, and greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
The truth is out there,</div>

<br />
Dear friend and fellow infoholics, <br />
<br />
Twice within the past week I have been advised privately that two of the Yahoo Groups I regularly post in have been infected with Internet Viruses and so forth that are being passed along in the outgoing posts. I suspect this is a personal attack again my ongoing research into the Philadelphia Experiment, Phoenix and Montauk Projects, and related conspiracy issues, since this is the second time it has happened to Yahoo Groups I have been posting in this year. I am still at a well scanned WAN both at the receiving and sending, and those who provide me information are also well protected. <br />
I am willing to set up private Blind Copy BCC lists to send all posts to anyone who wants around the groups to avoid virus infections.

Mr. Goodwin,<br />
<br />
I am still awaiting your followup to your previous post:<br />
<br />
In response to  <br />
 <br />
Poster: Dave Goodwin<br />
Subject: RE: Montauk: Yes, My Personal Research Goes On . . . }  <br />
<br />
<br />
I see what you mean Zxavier I am a psychic and I can certainly see that you shouldnt want to get tangled in that mesh! <br />
<br />
&lt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Well I see that there is a bit of mistrust and motive on your behalf. Maybe you should inform the other posters who you really are, and your plans Mr. Lauirer? <br />
<br />
So you say.  <br />
 <br />
    I am in no wise either impressed or intimidated by your psychic abilities, as they were when you posted that message, or are they currently.  I wasn't referring to that at all really.  My stated purpose in being at this web board as the countless others I have become invovled with since I returned to this web info-circuit is to research and to search information with others who are interested in like topics, not to become snared in worthless debates and exchanges of individuals' assessments of each other.  Your claivoyant gifts have nothing to do with that.  And that is the order of things.<br />
     I welcome anything else you may have to say to me in open forum or by private E-Mail at: <a href="mailto:commander_zxavier@s-mail.com.">commander_zxavier@s-mail.com.</a></div>

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>RE: Montaque; Yes, My Personal Hygene Is Good.</b><br />
<br />
Does anybody have any information about supposed vampire-type people and any aspect of either the Rainbow and Phoenix projects?This info, along with the Montauk Project, say a type of hybrid vampire, that is both human, however carries a primary genome, ONLY,  from past classic types, stiles of vampires.<br />
<br />
Note the geneses points for this change in the K-17 captured said by yahoo in-lab real vampire virus, was about one hundred fifty years ago, in two places within Europe.{K-17 search word}<br />
<br />
One was Bohemia, in a village where fifty percent of the population had been bitten by real, classical sorts of vampires.<br />
<br />
The parents did not all turn, however the children were born half vampire.This was without a demonic component to their blood and were used to hunt down, real vampires, similar to how a bloodhound would.<br />
<br />
Is there any intimation at all, of either real or half vampires, being used in any or these formentioned projects?<br />
<br />
Please on this board, or confidentially addressed to me.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much ahead of time.<br />
<br />
*Note these are not goths, however the real thing.<br />
<br />
You need to study about vampires if you don't understand what a real and half vampire delineate is.</div>

<br />
Creedo,<br />
<br />
I have never heard of this aspect, but have no doubt that what you say is correct.  It seems that no one I have previously discussed Montauk and similar alt-topics outside of the Time Travel Institue circles is willing to discuss much of anything with me at this point.<br />
<br />
I am not certain who it was in this group that even extended to me a stern warning last winter just before I dropped out for a while . . . to be very careful with my personal resaearch.  My Teslan contact is ignoring all attempts I have made to reestablish interactive contact.  I do know that his &quot;busines&quot; website, last time I checked it, had an E-Mail contact address that was no longer active, and the &quot;company&quot; E-Mail: <a href="mailto:holo@holoteslab.net">holo@holoteslab.net</a> has been over quota for several months now.<br />
<br />
Please keep in direct contact.</div>

   Dear Montauik Ehtusiasts,<br />
<br />
There hasn't been much activity in this board for many months, other than a couple of skeptics trying to shoot the rest of us down. There is still information to be gleaned in this area, as well as ongong research and devlopment projects at such locations as Area 51, NV &amp; Dulce, NM, Pine Gap &amp; Australia, Wright-Patterson, OH, just to name a few. There are countless newsgroups that deal with these if any of you are interested.  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite9" alt=":eek:" title="Eek!    :eek:" /></div>

 :devil: TTA,<br />
<br />
Have you found any more answers to the questions we raised here about Montauk &amp; Phase Shifting, i.e., the possibility of those with natural phase shifting or phase splitting abilities being triggered by being in the proximity of phase shifting technology such as was being experimented with big time at Montauk in the 1950's, '60's, and '70s, at least??<br />
<br />
I am still persuaded that my having been there withing that equimpment caused me some problems immediately, and for a long period of time afterwards.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>RE: Phase Shifting</b><br />
<br />
Hello... 2 years've passed since the last post here... I've just got curious about this matter since I've seen the witness of Cameron on TV. Primarly I've thought it was just the usual TV stuff to take audience, later I've decided to go to google and look for something about this. Since I've found some NASA secret stuff on google with password about gravity experiments (that I've neither tryed to catch from my home Internet line) I wouldn't have been too surprised if I would have found some militar secrets on google as well. <br />
But everything I've found out till now has been what I've known by TV. <br />
Now... My skepticism in this stuff is about this: I mean... if they own this kind of knowledge why till nowdays no-one has come back from the future telling us about catastrophic stuff... or warned us about something will happen in the future with some sort TV hijacking? <br />
While looking on this matter I've red about the time travel as well... and well the answer is that it would change nothing in his world since he would just create a parallel univers to his one.<br />
But his universe would be exactly the same when he gets back. <br />
This one is the theory according to there would be countless universes.<br />
<br />
Since I haven't broken into that NASA page I haven't known what kind of gravity experiments they haven been doing... I've found it out while I have been looking for achiving information about levitation and if there's been something like in the movie back to the future.<br />
And I've found out something interesting about a russian scientist who could levitate with a strange machine... It was like a jumper (you know those toys you give to children with a spring to jump) made from copper.<br />
Well, while I've been doing doing a research about that stuff I've found out that NASA page.<br />
Now I don't know if they're moving into experiments so they can recreate gravity in flying ships, or if they're moving in the direction of levitation but they're doing some research on that matter.<br />
My e-mail is <a href="mailto:deviad@msn.com">deviad@msn.com</a><br />
Sorry for my English but I'm not from USA or UK.</div>
