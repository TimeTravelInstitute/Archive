								<div class="bbWrapper">There are many rumors surrounding Montauk point and its link with the Philadelphia (or Rainbow) Project. As a continuation of the previous one, the Montauk Project explored the human conscienceness and its ability to manipulate time and reality, as well as the minds of others under its influence by amplication through a computer system. The scientists there also were rumored to have imprinted this signal onto a large spherical radio scalar sphere (like a large lightning ball). With this they were able to create a portal. These projects supposabily ended in 1983 with the closing of the base as the result of a project losing control. But is it still going on, are minds still being controlled and time and reality as we know it being manipulated? Is the HAARP project the next step in this project to control the largest scalar sphere of all in the core of this planet to manipulate all space/time? Information, please.....<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">I've never heard anything about this project, but i have however been interested in timetravle. I don't know much and am quite confused. You said that this project explored human conscienceness but that sound more like a physic theory than one for science. FROM what i know about physic research some say that when preforming and OBE (out of body experience or alstral projection) people can travle great distances and back in time. I really have no clue where i am going with this so i think i'm gonna stop here. Could you please EXPLAIN the Montauk Point to me? <br />

Einstein was rumoured to have worked on this project too. <br />
<br />
There are many rumours as to what the effects were but one is this: that it transported objects through time, space and matter but it could not be controlled. If the project is still underway today then I would presume they would be working on controlling the effects that it causes.</div>

MONTAUK AIR FORCE STATION == ACTIVE OR NOT?<br />

::: FORWARD :::<br />
<br />
I've conducted a two year investigation INTO allegations made by scientist Alfred Bielek, Preston Nichols &amp; Peter Moon (authors of the Montauk Project book series) and other people regarding ultra-top-secret experiments carried out by clandestine units of government intelligence and military agencies, corporations such as A.I.L., Siemens/ITT, as well as certain divisions of Brookhaven Labs and other groups FROM the 1950s up to present times. These activities are by all indications currently ongoing at a fully verified and documented subterranean facility beneath the purportedly abandoned and derelict Montauk Air Force Station. The radar station is at the extreme eastern tip of Long Island, N.Y.'s south fork.<br />
<br />
The remnants of the surface military installation are indeed in severe disrepair, but the underground continues to be active. Ludicrously enough, the surface of the land is now a N.Y. State Park ... on paper at least. However by terms of the deed, the Federal government still retains all rights to any and all property beneath the surface! Investigations reveal that several new, deeper levels have been added in the early 1990s. Fields of research conducted there are said to include psychotronics (interfacing mind &amp; machine), particle beams, electromagnetic mind control, black-hole simulations and interdimensional/time travel experiments (warping time and space). Very strong evidence indicates particle accelerators are in use there and at nearby facilities -- such as Brookhaven Labs -- for powering particle beam weapons, HAARP transmissions and exotic particle beam radar systems.<br />
<br />
The continuing lack of any credible explanation for what caused the crash of TWA Flight 800 over a year ago offshore FROM Westhampton has focused considerable attention on eastern Long Island as a place where unusual things happen unusually often. In fact, there are substantial indications that particle beam operations at Brookhaven Labs the night of July 17 1996 were in fact responsible for the disaster, and this is delved INTO in more depth within the report.<br />
<br />
I've put together the report based on personal interviews with project participants, on-site investigations at Montauk Air Force Station (Camp Hero), and extensive historical and background research. This report verifies without doubt current clandestine activities at the underground installation, as well as other locations mentioned; it includes corroborative testimony FROM area residents and visitors who have very recently had frightening encounters at this location with mysterious, threatening unidentified security personnel toting automatic weapons.<br />
<br />
In the past year mainstream newspapers in Montauk and East Hampton have carried several articles about various aspects of the Montauk Project. For many in the area it is (unfortunately) becoming an accepted part of life there, as it has for others who have found the preponderance of solid evidence supporting allegations of highly irregular, horrific activities at Montauk Air Force Station impossible to dismiss. This is an incredible state of affairs taking place 100 miles FROM N.Y.C. &quot;underneath&quot; eastern L.I.'s sun and surf playground.<br />
<br />
::: MONTAUK AIR FORCE STATION == ACTIVE OR NOT? :::<br />
<br />
All material copyright (c) 1997 John A. Quinn All rights reserved<br />
<br />
To get things started on the right note (and put the reader in the proper frame of mind) this question should be answered forthwith, as simply and directly as possible; the answer is no ... but yes: and here is the story.<br />
<br />
Within the past two years, several incidents of a deeply disturbing and highly irregular nature have occurred at or near Camp Hero/Montauk Air Force Station, an ostensibly derelict facility at the extreme eastern end of Long Island's south fork and adjacent to Montauk Point's historic lighthouse. This area is currently administered by the New York State Parks system and is in fact a designated state park, on paper at least. Two of these incidents involved women, one of whom was accompanied by her children, being accosted, harassed and threatened at gunpoint by unidentified government/military personnel while in the vicinity. They were told that they had violated top secret and restricted areas and were subject to arrest; however no arrests were made. Another such incident involving weapons happened within the past year when a young man was walking in the so-called state park. A similar event sans automatic weapons took place in mid-April of 1995 when a family walking there encountered a security agent, also unidentified, who abusively harassed the family and threatened to have them arrested for the same alleged violation; again no arrests were made. In April 1996, in an effort to bring themselves up-to-date on the status of the area, this family again entered the restricted portion of Camp Hero State Park, and they were once more approached by a non-uniformed guard who &quot;advised&quot; them that they were intruding INTO an area designated off-limits to the public, and were to leave immediately. This follows upon an inexplicably large number of similar events within recent years. There is much well-substantiated testimony extending back at least twenty-five years of bizarre, unconstitutional and horrific activities secretly conducted by shadowy government and military agencies at this location.<br />
<br />
In addition to the known military bases (U.S. Army) Camp Hero and Montauk Air Force Station, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans and records establish conclusive proof of the existence of at least four levels of subterranean facilities beneath Camp Hero, and according to informed sources up to three additional levels have been added as recently as the early 1990s. Montauk is actually geologically DISTINCT FROM the rest of Long Island and is the top of an undersea mountain, so there is plenty of bedrock to go down into. Camp Hero was a U.S. Army installation established prior to WW2, and Montauk Air Force Station was established within its perimeter as the Army phased out of the location in the 1950s. The Air Force Station was officially active only until 1969, and federal records do SHOW that no legitimate source of funding existed past that time to keep the base in operation as it's SAGE radar system had by then become obsolete, yet recovered Air Force documents and numerous witnesses verify indisputably that the Air Force Station was still active long after then.<br />
<br />
Recently much evidence has surfaced indicating that the base and the subterranean facilities were and still are used for a tremendous amount of top secret, ultra-classified research and experimentation (much of which falls under the umbrella of the code-named Phoenix Project) in quantum and particle physics (black hole simulation), super-powerful electrical fields, weather control, psychotronics (interfacing mind and machine), genetics, particle beam technology, and electronic and drug- based mind control. The preponderance of this evidence strongly suggests that a great many of these activities have been thoroughly malevolent as to both their desired ends and the means used to achieve those ends, and have utilized unwitting and even helpless subjects -- including at times, youngsters abducted FROM surrounding communities. Certain of these experiments in controlled warping of our time-space continuum had such devastating results and almost inconceivably awesome potential consequences that several project insiders conspired to sabotage the proceedings in August 1983, forcing the base's total, but as it turns out only temporary, abandonment.<br />
<br />
::: NO PICNICS AT CAMP HERO STATE PARK :::<br />
<br />
It is a matter of public record that the federal government turned the Camp Hero/Montauk A.F. Station property over to New York State for use as public park land in 1984, yet according to the terms of the deed on record at the Suffolk County offices in Riverhead, N.Y., the federal government retains all rights to all property beneath the surface of the land -- only the surface of this area was actually donated to N.Y. State. The deed also holds that the federal government can reclaim the surface of the land as well for reasons of national security, if necessary.<br />
<br />
Thirteen years after this transfer, at least 2/3 of this so-called park remain completely off-limits to the public! This itself is in fact a violation of the N.Y. State Parks' charter, and the restriction is enforced severely by a host of various authorities -- sometimes at gunpoint. Electronics technicians have monitored and recorded extremely unusual and unorthodox radio frequency and other electromagnetic transmissions emanating directly FROM this supposedly restricted and/or derelict property at the present time, which indicate activities very much like those alleged to have occurred there, and I have personally seen and heard with my own eyes and ears these bizarre and complex EM/RF signal transmissions monitored and traced by direction-finding receivers and other equipment.<br />
<br />
New telephone lines and new high capacity power lines with a gigawatt meter have been installed in this allegedly derelict and off-limits area fairly recently, and witnesses observed a highly advanced Cardion Corp. particle beam radar unit being operated on the bluffs at Camp Hero for a period of at least five months in 1994. Investigators were given several different explanations as to the reason for this FROM various Cardion (Siemens) officials, and one witness was told point-blank by a security guard there that the unit had been malfunctioning in the underground and was thus brought to the surface for testing!<br />
<br />
The electrical meter with gigawatt capability is on a structure claimed as an equipment maintenance building by State Parks officials: one the few functional buildings within the restricted area. Gigawatts of electrical power is a tremendous amount of power -- enough to run a large city, but where is the city at Montauk Point? Underground, apparently. Investigators of clandestine activities there assert that if gigawatts of electricity were discharged (utilized) within that single building it would be completely demolished by fire in record time. They point to the existence of the power line and gigawatt meter as clear evidence of secret, and by extrapolation unconstitutional, illicit operations at the A.F. Station. In June 1996 this assertion was confirmed as fact by a serviceman (who wishes to retain confidentiality) for LILCO, the electric utility company for the Montauk area (and virtually all Long Island). A linesman and meter reader for the Camp Hero vicinity, he has stated for the record that he and his supervisors are indeed aware that a tremendous amount of electricity is utilized by this power line and recorded by the meter. He also noted that it is absolutely not possible for the one maintenance building to use that much power for equipment maintenance operations or any other conceivable and legitimate State Parks activities.<br />
<br />
::: STRANGE SCIENCE FACT :::<br />
<br />
There are a number of claims being made about this location by people like Preston Nichols, a radio-electronics engineer and technician who's worked for Bookhaven National Laboratories and top-secret defence contactor A.I.L. on Long Island.<br />
<br />
Nichols has co-authored three books on the subject of the activities at Montauk Air Force Station popularly known as the Montauk Project. The research and experimentation alleged to have occurred in the subterranean facility beneath Camp Hero, which include psychotronic and electromagnetic mind control operations of a very extreme nature, and also interdimensional and time manipulations and travel, may no doubt strike some readers as bordering on science fiction. However, a careful perusal of numerous investigative reports and news stories, Congressional hearings, scientific papers, and relevant federal documents will SHOW that in fact many different types of electromagnetic mind manipulation technologies have been thoroughly tested and developed by intelligence agencies and other groups; the trail goes back a good fifty years or more and these technologies are well understood, quite effective, and in widespread use. As well, a complete study of the more recent concepts and developments in quantum physics shows very widespread support for theories which provide for the possibility, even likelihood, of the development of methods to accomplish travel both in time and in other dimensions. For example, in March 1994 Scientific American published a paper by David Deutsch and Michael Lockwood which concluded flatly that nothing in the currently known laws of physics prohibits such excursions. In fact, the burden of proof is now far and away upon the doubters of time and dimensional travel to make their case that such are impossible. A number of the great minds in contemporary physics -- including but not limited to Nick Herbert, Kip Thorne, Frank Tipler, Fred Allen Wolf, Michio Kaku, Steven Hawking (a recent and enthusiastic convert) and Paul Halpern -- postulate that time travel can in fact be achieved. It can be said conclusively, proven beyond any doubt within the framework of contemporary science, that parallel dimensions exist -- probable realities to us, apparently infinite in number; our familiar 3D time/space continuum is but one manifestation.<br />
<br />
Fundamentally, it is our consciousness which in some way literally brings INTO being the dimension or reality we experience, manifesting it FROM what are to us realms of infinite potentials. This was demonstrated in a mathematical form known as Von Neumann's Proof, developed by Hungarian-born physicist Janus Eric Von Neumann and published in the 1930's in his book The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Physics, known even today as &quot;the bible&quot; among quantum physicists. (More about Von Neumann later.) Other developments have demonstrated that time as it is commonly conceived of, a linear progression FROM past to present to future, does not ultimately exist.<br />
<br />
Experiments conducted at Columbia University in the early 1970s proved that a decision made by an observer/researcher which determines whether or not a photon has traveled as a wave or a particle (by either causing or not causing wave interference), and which is made after the photon is emitted INTO a multi- mirrored device (which considerably delays its journey), will also determine the state of that photon at the time it is emitted -- showing that the present does affect the past and thus the future can affect the present. Therefore all time is in actuality simultaneous; what we call past and future exist &quot;now&quot;. The past isn't gone and the future isn't yet to come. Then where are they? In another dimension. Similar alterations to traditional concepts about space, in particular vast distances, must ensue FROM such scientifically accepted facts.<br />
<br />
Another body of research used extensively in top secret projects involving ultra-advanced technologies is that of Nikola Tesla, a towering scientific genius and the true father of our present- day AC electrical system, who as far back as the turn of the century had reportedly developed such technologies as particle beam and antigravity devices, wireless power transmission, psychotronics, and &quot;free&quot; energy, to name a few. Much of his work remains only dimly comprehended by many scientists even today. Tesla and his inventions figured prominently in the legendary &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot; which was in fact part of the Phoenix Project research.<br />
<br />
It must be pointed out to those revisionists who discount the reality of the Philadelphia Experiment and also to those whose minds boggle at the contemplation of such subjects, that there is ample evidence in the public record alone, (newspapers, magazines, periodicals, etc.), showing that in the later 1930s and early 1940s Naval Intelligence and other agencies were indeed wholeheartedly researching radar cloaking technology with the top minds in physics, including John Hutchenson, Emil Kurtenhour, Albert Einstein, Von Neumann and Tesla. Although not often discussed then or now, literal sight invisibility was also a subject of considerable interest in this work. Sites for this research were first the University of Chicago and then later The Institute for Advanced Studies, a front organization for groups connected to the one-world government conclave -- the Council of Rhodes.<br />
<br />
It's perhaps noteworthy that Tesla maintained research facilities at Shoreham, Long Island, not far FROM Montauk. Shoreham is reputed to be a geomagnetic &quot;hot spot&quot; or power point, although not of the same magnitude as Montauk is. This subject will be explored more later in this report.<br />
<br />
::: PANDORA'S BOX :::<br />
<br />
Some of the most startling information now available regarding such highly classified research and experimentation in ultra- advanced physics, the resultant technologies, and the uses to which such were put can be found in the Montauk Project book series by Preston Nichols and Peter Moon, which provide extensive details on recent activities of the Phoenix Project. Following the Philadelphia Experiment in 1943, an early attempt at &quot;Stealth&quot; (radar invisibility) and according to some sources literal invisibility as well, which by most accounts ended in uncontrollable and nightmarish failure, such interdimensional research was put on hold while the A-bomb was developed and WW2 was fought and won, certainly against Japan. (In regard to the war against Nazi Germany, however, the outcome was not as clear- cut and decisive as the history books might have one believe -- certainly no atomic bombs were dropped -- and we shall find out more about this further on.)<br />
<br />
In the late 1940s, realizing that the Phoenix Project lines of research, if properly harnessed, controlled and developed, had astonishing and un-dreamed-of possibilities, clandestine government agencies reopened Pandora's Box.<br />
<br />
The worst problems encountered during the Philadelphia Experiment were the extraordinarily destructive and bizarre effects on the human beings who were aboard the battleship used in the experiment. The ship and crew allegedly disappeared FROM sight for some time: devastating psychological damage as well as horrifying physical results such as sailors being embedded in the metal of the ship when it did reappear (rematerialize) were reportedly some of these effects. Janus Von Neumann, who was the director of the Philadelphia Experiment, (staying on after Tesla had quit in disgust over his concern about just such effects upon people) was called upon to find out more regarding how human beings were impacted by entering other time-space dimensions and to develop technology which could allow people to do so without severe damage. Von Neumann, who unlike Tesla had little use for metaphysics or parapsychology, soon found himself unable to avoid coming to terms with both the psychic and spiritual aspects of human beings in addition to the material or physical level. Suffice it to say that some element of a person, often called a spirit or soul, must remain in sync with his/her original time-space lock which begins at the time of physical conception (incarnation) while transferring to or returning FROM other dimensions, if such wide scale destructive results are to be avoided. Von Neumann, exercising once again his prodigious mental abilities, came up with the world's first electronic computer, which had the capability to calculate certain time- space referencing factors with absolute precision -- a necessity for what was to be accomplished; in addition, psychotronic equipment was created which could receive, reconfigure and transmit radio-type frequencies generated by thoughts FROM the human mind (frequencies which do exist and can be picked up by what are commonly called &quot;psychics&quot; (no, they're not all phony); and by extension, devices which could externally and artificially alter or &quot;control&quot; people's minds.<br />
<br />
Among the early objectives of the Phoenix Project have been (and are still! &lt;see info on Project HAARP further on&gt;) achieving weather control capabilities. Secret agencies of the U.S. government and groups associated with such received a big boost in this area, and in development of psychotronic technologies in general, FROM the research and work of Wilhelm Reich, a veritable genius in a variety of fields; scientific, medical, psychological and metaphysical. Reich demonstrated by extensive experimentation that a form of electromagnetic energy he termed &quot;orgone&quot; energy had a significant impact on psychological states of mind as well weather conditions. Regarding the latter, Reich donated his &quot;cloud-busting&quot; technology to the U.S. government for no financial compensation, as he himself was pursuing other implications of his discoveries. (Partly due to pressure FROM the A.M.A., Reich was mercilessly hounded and harassed by federal agents and his Long Island laboratory and research destroyed; he was in fact imprisoned for, among other charges, practicing medicine without a license.) Reich's weather control technology was utilized and further developed by the government, and integrated with other aspects of the Phoenix Project.<br />
<br />
A number of researchers including Preston Nichols assert that the Phoenix Project technologies were developed and perfected to a high degree, to a large extent at facilities on Long Island such as Brookhaven National Labs. Much of this was legitimately funded until the late 1960s when Congress, upon being informed by Brookhaven Labs, Siemens/ITT, A.I.L. and other contractors of the advanced developmental state of, and great effectiveness of, the psychotronic and mind control aspects of the project, prudently decided to end such research at once and for good lest such technology fall INTO the wrong hands and be used in unacceptable ways. This may have been one of the few recent Congressional actions displaying any real backbone, but unfortunately, the technology was already in the &quot;wrong&quot; hands. Dismayed by the action of Congress, project directors approached certain members of the intelligence and military hierarchies in secret and unconstitutionally conspired to continue this experimentation, again in secret, at the recently closed down Montauk Air Force Station. Janus Von Neumann was once more made senior scientific director as the Phoenix Project avenues of research were taken to extraordinary new heights. This, the so-called &quot;Montauk Project&quot; specifically, dealt for the most part with psychotronic and inter- dimensional areas of experimentation. Electro-magnetic mind control experiments using high-powered radio frequency transmissions were conducted continually upon visiting servicemen and women &quot;invited&quot; to the base for R&amp;R; upon the population at large in surrounding communities; and most incredibly, upon numerous abducted children.<br />
<br />
There are definite indications and testimony that the Montauk Point military facilities were the site of psychological and mind (control) research even before 1969; according to researchers Camp Hero had been known as a psych base ever since its inception not long after the federal government acquired the land in 1910 through outright trickery, fraud and deception practiced against its rightful owners -- the Montauk Indian tribe.<br />
<br />
Substantial evidence FROM numerous sources shows that our federal government's intelligence agencies are responsible for an astonishing assortment of mind control experiments and projects, dating back at least 50 years. The Napa (CA) Sentinel ran a lengthy series in 1991 which provided a fairly comprehensive overview of the general &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; in mind control activities in the U.S.; the Washington Post has run some good coverage on the CIA's and NSA's hellacious abuses in this field. The Church (Senate) Committee hearings during the 1970s INTO the practices of the CIA, NSA and the like in such matters really only scratched the surface of a sordid, brutal and little-known aspect of the U.S. intelligence services' record in this type of experimentation -- almost always involving complete abject abuse of and disregard for constitutional, civil and human rights. In 1994 the Senate Committee on Veteran's Affairs (chaired by John D. Rockefeller) held hearings INTO the practices of military and intelligence groups regarding their use of unwitting, unsuspecting subjects in a substantial portion of the so-called research done INTO fields such as testing the effects of chemical/biological weapons and the uses of drugs and configured EM/RF transmissions in mind (and body) control.<br />
<br />
At Montauk, to simplify considerably, the basic research agenda was as follows. Extremely gifted and rigorously trained psychics were hooked up via psychotronic equipment to computers which converted the waveforms of their thoughts to (digital) computer code, and also relayed the waveforms to exceptionally high-powered EM/RF transmitters which broadcast thought, mind and consciousness- altering signals. According to accounts, certain experiments achieved materialization, at varying levels of stability and solidity, of objects visualized by the psychics whose thoughts were then broadcast, as well as teleportation effects. (IBM's Web site is currently &lt;5/97&gt; displaying a blurb about their research and intended development of teleportation technology.)<br />
<br />
By the late 1970s at Montauk, furthermore, very advanced experimentation was undertaken in the controlled &quot;warping&quot; of space and time, utilizing some of Tesla's (long since dead), Von Neumann's and others' ideas and inventions. Tremendously powerful electrical currents flowing in specific configurations generated electromagnetic fields which created in effect a working &quot;Tipler cylinder&quot;. To simplify once more, psychics were again utilized to visualize and stabilize a target destination in a different time/space dimension which the vortex would then be focused upon. The Tipler cylinder, a concept formulated by the aforementioned physicist Frank Tipler, is presently one of the most widely accepted theoretical models in quantum physics of how to create an artificial, controllable &quot;black hole&quot;, thereby achieving time-space and dimensional shifting and even the ability to effect alterations and manipulations of our time-space continuum.<br />
<br />
Some of this sounds quite exciting, amazing, even wonderful, and certainly in some ways it probably is. However, to a great extent such activities were and are done with absolutely no regard for the effects on the people experimented upon; furthermore, this work is done with the full intention of using the knowledge and capabilities gained to more thoroughly and completely subjugate humanity with ever-more-powerful and pervasive control of our consciousness: in fact, and literally if we remember Von Neumann's Proof, &quot;reality engineering&quot;. According to Nichols, an unquestionably brilliant radio- electronics engineer who worked often in the Montauk Project in an altered state of mind while simultaneously employed by Brookhaven National Labs (such alternate awareness can be achieved with variations of psychotronic technologies) -- and also according to other first-hand participants in certain of these experiments -- some of the youngsters abducted and so viciously abused in these activities died as a result and were buried en masse on site! The human tragedy attested to here begins to rival such indelible atrocities as the Pol-Pot massacres or Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen in its horror and brutality. The fact that this was done to American children on American soil by agencies connected, however tenuously, to our government is virtually unimaginable; yet as we have discovered, many of the assertions made by Phoenix/Montauk investigators have been checked out and verified.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, the Montauk Project crashed and burned in August 1983, sabotaged FROM within by certain key participants who could no longer tolerate what was going on. A time tunnel type link- up with the Philadelphia Experiment exactly forty years previously (August 12, 1943) was allegedly achieved then -- apparently an attempt by project operators to REPAIR or undo damage they felt had been done to the time-space continuum during the 1943 experiment; thereafter, the project ended temporarily, as described, with the surface of the property being then donated to N.Y. State.<br />

Col. Corso confirms Philadelphia Experiment<br />
<br />
An RCN Minesweeper of the &quot;Bangor&quot; class<br />
<br />
Excerpted from: &quot;Hypotheses - superatoms, neutrinos and extraterrestrials&quot;<br />
by Bob Beckwith and Drew Craig<br />
<br />
CHAPTER 15: THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT<br />
<br />
SUMMARY/DISCUSSION: In one author's (Bob's) experience, the Philadelphia Story did happen during WW2 (in early 1944) but was related to the battle of sonar under water just off our coast. It was not related to the battle of radar over the skies of Europe as told in the movie THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. Also the boat involved was the minesweeper IX97, not the USS Destroyer Eldridge as in the 1984 science fiction version of the event.<br />
<br />
Just as early in the war we were losing the radar war over Europe, we were losing the sonar battle against German mines and submarines off our shores.<br />
<br />
Could we get troops to England in time? We did!<br />
<br />
Would the atomic bomb be finished in time? We used it!<br />
<br />
Was the war of radar and sonar won in time for us to win the war without needing the two atomic bombs? How will we ever know?<br />
<br />
In the actual Philadelphia Experiment the minesweeper IX97 was moved in time FROM a position in the Philadelphia harbor outside the Navy shipyard to a position at dock in Newport News CT where the IX97 had been two weeks previously. As the experimental power was raised nothing happened until suddenly, wham! It happened and sailors died as a result.<br />
<br />
Author Col. Philip J. Corso has confirmed The Experiment FROM work he did with Admiral Burke while Chairman and chief policy maker of President Eisenhower's National Security Administration. Corso tells me (Bob Beckwith) of Burke's knowledge of the experiment and his deep concern and regret over the loss of life that resulted. Corso tells me that my recall of the event has greater detail than any source that he knows of.<br />
<br />
Adm. Burke<br />
<br />
He tells me that the project continued and has progressed greatly since then. Col. Corso has kindly given permission to use his name to this important confirmation of my 55 year old memory.<br />
<br />
The Experiment used and confirmed the principle of Chapter 13: Divided Space. As a result we now know that once the threshold of divided space is crossed, levitation, teleportation and time travel all become possible.<br />
<br />
The ability of gifted humans to levitate, teleport and travel in time can now be supported, duplicated and studied in university Biology and Psychology laboratories. Concurrently the barrier to low energy levitation, teleportation and time travel can be crossed in Engineering and Physics laboratories. Results FROM studies with humans and studies with machinery can then be compared in recognition of the same underlying principle: Divided Space!<br />
<br />
(Note: Divided Space is what Dr. Greer refers to as the space on the other side of the Crossing Point of Light.)<br />
<br />
91<br />
<br />
We cannot creep, however, using conservative scientific methods, INTO the realm of levitation, teleportation and time travel any more than we could have crept slowly INTO setting off the bomb.<br />
<br />
History leading up to this subject starts with Nikola Tesla in 1907. According to some reports he performed an experiment which was immediately classified. When he passed away in 1943 a custody battle evolved over ownership of his many notes. Some were taken to the Beograd N.T. Museum in Yugoslavia. Others were reported to have been seized and kept secret by our government. Many guesses have been made as to the nature of his experiment. So why not include ours as well?<br />
<br />
It is possible that Tesla put an object at point A on a TABLE and then moved it to point B on the table. By applying power to an inventive circuit he was able to move it back to point A. Turning off the power brought it back to point B. This much is pretty well understood. Our guess is that he put coils under the TABLE creating a three phase magnetic field around the object operating at a frequency of about 7.5 Hertz. When he applied power to the coils the object appeared to move FROM point B to point A and when power was removed, move back again to point B. What he did was use the fields to move the object in time back to when it was at point A and then remove power and let it come back to the present at point B.<br />
<br />
The principle of divided time needs to be expanded INTO theories which separates the phenomena of levitation, teleportation and time travel. Without these theories very small scale experiments should be safely possible without knowing in advance just what to expect.<br />
<br />
There may be a source of information FROM synchronous electric power generators that are not totally enclosed so that the rotors are visible at least on one end. Hydro generators are generally of this type. Actually we have heard stories of generator rotors becoming hard to see as the generators are brought up to speed with their fields applied. Perhaps the phenomena is so common that operators pay no attention. The authors need to schedule a trip to a generating plant to watch a non-enclosed generator when it is started up.<br />
<br />
It is likely that Tesla was not using Einstein's principles as much as he was defying them. The government may have convinced him to keep time travel a secret and he went through the rest of his life frustrated in feeling people didn't listen to him but not able to tell them of his experiments. Or perhaps he did tell some who would not believe him and considered him somewhat crazy. The answers may be found in his notes if they are ever declassified. Tesla's experiment may have been the secret starting point for the Philadelphia Experiment.<br />
<br />
92<br />
<br />
It is known that Tesla was interested in the possibility of transmitting alternating current power using purely magnetic waves. Our hypothesis of a six dimensional space uses the fifth and sixth dimension for electro and magnetic fields respectively. The experiment described herein used very large currents producing huge magnetic fields with only very small voltages to drive the currents. The waves used here would have been almost purely on the sixth, magnetic plane. If the stories of his experiments in 1907 are true, it seems likely that Tesla used the same fields produced by what are now conventional three phase currents.<br />
<br />
Now we must get INTO the mind set of the nation during WW2. In about July of 1939 the Hearst Sunday supplement section of the Cleveland Plain Dealer carried an article telling of Fermi's theoretical work on nuclear fission. I remember reading about the predicted tank of water in everyone's basement with a bit of uranium heating the house for years at very low cost. Nuclear trains, planes, automobiles and everything else were projecte. And also, so was the bomb. If a copy of this article could be found it would be of great historic interest!<br />
<br />
After getting an engineering degree FROM Case School of Applied Science I (Bob) went to work with General Electric. In 1942 I developed highly successful frequency shift keyed (FSK) transfer trip equipment. This eliminated one high voltage circuit breaker at each substation where generator power was stepped up in voltage for sending over a distance. The work had AAA priority as a part of a nationally coordinated electric utility crash program to connect existing generation together to supply power to Oak Ridge and to Hanford.<br />
<br />
Our use of FSK was some 5 years ahead of a second use in FSK telemetry (we had always called it telemetering) used after the war in test firing captured German V2 rockets at White sands. The FSK telemetry was derived FROM our work by Walt Hausz and others FROM the GE lab at Ithaca NY who had a contract for the test firing. FSK has since blossomed INTO world wide use.<br />
<br />
Remembering the Hearst article, there was never a doubt in my mind that our work was related to whatever was happening on the Manhattan project. I was silent, however, since everyone else seemed to have missed or forgotten the Hearst article. Or perhaps some were playing the same discrete game of silence that I was.<br />
<br />
I wish I had kept a small article in the paper about a congressman, Harry Truman, who demanded to know why a lot of young men at Oak Ridge Tennessee and Hanford Washington were deferred. Someone must have taken congressman Truman aside and told him it was OK since no more of his objection followed in the newspapers.<br />
<br />
93<br />
<br />
In April, 1945, President Roosevelt died and Truman became president. Soon after president Truman made the big decision to DROP the bomb.<br />
<br />
There were three major problems for electronic engineers during WW2. One was the battle of radar and very nicely presented recently in an hour long program on the Discovery channel. Sir Watson Watt of England was given credit for the development however others were also working on it. Professor Jack Martin at Case told me rather secretly about the development in 1941 before I graduated. I remember meeting Sir Watson Watt at an AIEE winter power meeting in New Your City shortly after the war ended.<br />
<br />
A second problem was the making and breaking of cryptographic codes, always kept very secret. There are few secrets anymore with most principles of cryptology available in technical papers readily available to anyone with the smarts to understand them. The only truly secret code may be quite simple but one requiring the receiving party to carry a decrypting message with him. The most elemental code is a 1 or 0 meaning 'yes' or 'no'--but what is the guestion? Or the question is 'well known but which is 'yes', the 1 or the 0?<br />
<br />
A third, also kept quite secret, was the battle, using sonar against German submarines and mines. Our sonar was all made by the Submarine Signal Co of Groton CT, and I remember working with engineers FROM Sub Signal. They bragged about furnishing all of the sonar to the German and Japanese navies. As a result both the Germans and the Japanese had an earlier, lower frequency version than the one we were using. Neither enemy country had developed sonar technology and couldn't catch up with ours during WWII. The older technology used essentially electro-magnetic (EM) 'big loudspeaker' technology and our newer heads used a very secret barium titanate transducer.<br />
<br />
These sonar heads could be extended downward FROM surface ships much as an upside down periscope and generally built in place on submarines. These EM heads operated at top frequencies of about 15 kilohertz. Ours, on the other hand, used newly developed barium titanate transducers operating with top ranges above the audible band at about 26 kHz. We could hear them but they could not hear us!<br />
<br />
In late 1942, the success of the FSK power line carrier equipment attracted the interest of people at Bell Telephone's Muray Hill Laboratories near Morristown NJ. In a trip by my supervisor at GE, Ed Kenefake and me to Bell Lab we learned of the problem of the bottom anchored German mine with its magnetic detector. As I remember, one meeting included a nationally known scientist. He took on the problem of the mine since it seemed we could lose the war by not being able to get troops to England before the development of the bomb was complete.<br />
<br />
94<br />
<br />
The Germans developed a mine towards the end of WW1 that was set off without necessary physical contact by detection of the magnetism of a ships steel hull. We were shown the magnetic detectors which involved a spring loaded solenoid with a permanent magnet floating against the spring. Between WWl and WW2 we had developed minesweepers that set these off using cables hanging along the sides of a surface operating minesweeper boat. The cables carried a low frequency AC current at the resonant frequency of the solenoid and spring. The frequency was in the 5 to 8 Hertz range. This caused the mines to detonate far enough away FROM the minesweeper so as generally not to cause damage.<br />
<br />
Then at the start of WW2, the Germans surprised us with a mine anchored to the bottom that would not explode when the detector was activated by the minesweeper but first would rise to the surface just in time to get the minesweeper. This was often fatal to our minesweeper and became a major problem in keeping our shipping lanes open. I don't remember how these mines were laid by the Germans but most likely FROM submarines just off the US coastline, far removed FROM the radar war over Europe.<br />
<br />
The actual fuse was quite sophisticated in that it would count ships before releasing the mine to the surface. The intent could have been to try to get the minesweeper or perhaps a troop carrier as a more important target than supply ships.<br />
<br />
Ed Kenefake and I visited Bell Laboratory in late 1942. The new problem of the bottom anchored German mines was studied and it was hoped that FSK sonar would detect the mines at a sufficient distance to find and destroy them. After all, we were enthusiastic about the excellent results that we were getting with the very new FSK technology applied to power line carrier equipment.<br />
<br />
An experiment was carried out early in 1943 in a very secret lake and unfortunately found out that the FSK sonar didn't work. The sonar head ran along a track in the lake. Using the FSK sonar, the head would run up and touch a dummy mine without seeing it!<br />
<br />
The very secret lake was found by following one's way through the woods beyond a particular mail box along a rural road outside Boonton NJ. One very helpful mailcarrier helped us find the lake by telling us where this mailbox was where he left mail for the laboratory. There was no evidence of a road whatsoever. We simply followed the only possible path between trees HAVING been told vaguely how to do this.<br />
<br />
The lab at the lake was operated by Bell Laboratories with Dr. Horton as our technical director. I remember Dr. Vannevar Bush being mentioned as the 'big man in charge' with names of Einstein and Tesla mentioned as involved. 'The bomb' wasn't ready and it was feared that the German submarine/mine problem might cause us to lose the war before the bomb could be used.<br />
<br />
95<br />
<br />
During that first visit we did hear of a program to quickly move a minesweeper out of the way when a mine was detected by sonar as rising FROM the bottom. After failure of the FSK sonar we received a continuing contract to develop frequency modulated sonar at 26 kHz for surface to surface and surface to submarine communications. This was potentially a secret means of communications since the Germans couldn't hear 26 kHz and might not know of its presence. Even if they did, there were no 26 kHz equipment on the German submarines. The FM communications was to be tried out at a laboratory facility at the New London CT Navy base.<br />
<br />
For our communications experiments we used the Sardonix, a luxury yacht converted for sonar work and the minesweeper IX97. The IX97 had degaussing cables hanging over the port and starboard sides of the boat. A third cable was supported on masts over the top of the boat.<br />
<br />
The officers took their ships where we needed them to go to carry out our experiments and had little involvement in the experiments except to volunteer to judge their ability to talk with the communications noise and distortion that was always present.<br />
<br />
I was issued the civilian pass SHIPS 3777 shown in Fig. l5.la giving me access to government and military facilities and especially to come aboard surface ships and submarines as required. The pass also got me my first ride on an airplane. It was on a DC3 on a flight to visit Hanford WA for work not related to the story here.<br />
<br />
At General Electric we developed equipment for FM voice modulation of 26 kHz sonar 'heads' for ship to ship to submarine voice communications. These were tested FROM June 16 to July 7, 1944, at the Underwater Sound Laboratories at the New London CT Naval base. Figs. 15.2a through 15.2e SHOW my expense account for the trip. Note the reference on the page for June 26 to 15,000 yards communications between the Sardonix and the IX97 using FM. Also note the lunch charges of 45 and 50 cents for meals on the Sardonix when at the dock with no charge on days at sea.<br />
<br />
Dr. Horton and I usually traveled with the Sardonix where we were always guests of the officers. No food could have been better. I remember the toast consisting of a loaf of bread with the crust removed and toasted as a loaf on all four sides so that just the edges of each slice were brown. This was saturated with butter as a loaf and served with 1&quot; cubes of butter. It was about the only butter that I saw during WW2!<br />
<br />
On June 27, Dr. Horton appeared with a Bell Lab single sideband transmitter and receiver converted for the 26 kHz we were using; saying &quot;Today we are going to test SSB.&quot; We did and it worked better than FM for a reason that surprised us both. On an<br />
<br />
96<br />
<br />
oscilloscope, the distortion of the FM and SSB were about the same. The difference was that the SSB distortion was linear. Even when the voice changed between 'rain-barrel' to dolphin squeak quality, the meaning of the messages was recognizable. With FM the distortion was non-linear and reduced the voice quality to unintelligible. I graciously conceded Dr. Horton, our boss, was very correct in his choice of single sideband.<br />
<br />
I had long technical discussions with Dr. Horton about the merits of FM and SSB for the task at hand. Our Bell Lab supervisor was Vic Graff, and I must pause to tell his story which may never be recorded otherwise.<br />
<br />
Before the war started, Vic was testing a Goodyear blimp with a prototype radar mounted on nylon cords glued to the air and gas bags between the upper gas filled portion of the blimp and the lower air filled portion. Air was pumped in and out of the lower part of the blimp in ORDER to go up or down.<br />
<br />
Before the submarine nets were closed at the entrance of Long Island Sound, it was found by sonar that a German sub had entered the sound waiting for the war to start. On an experimental run one evening, the sub was found on the surface charging its batteries. It immediately dove, however the blimp shut off its engines and drifted waiting for the sub to run out of air and to surface.<br />
<br />
Shortly before the time expected for the sub to have to surface, a vacuum tube in the radar quit. Vic stripped to his shorts and crawled out on the lower fabric, changed the tube, and got the radar working. Very soon after the REPAIR was made the sub surfaced. As soon as the sub surfaced it was picked up again on the blimps radar and the blimp drifted just over the unsuspecting sub while Vic and others opened the door and rolled bombs, brought along 'just in case', out the door sinking the sub.<br />
<br />
I can remember Dr. Horton telling us about a short trip to Pearl Harbor just before our June, 1944 experiment and telling of his ride on a submarine while there. It seems the sub got stuck in a bow up situation and had difficulty getting the ballast tanks straightened out so as to get horizontal again!<br />
<br />
In appreciation for the work that I did, Dr. Horton arranged for me to go to sea on a sub hunt sub mission on Monday July 3. This turned out to be a game of our sonar vs the German sub sonar. Our boat made no contact during the day but I well remember the return to base in the evening. We were entering the narrows leading to New London harbor where ships had to proceed one after another. Our sub was coming in on the surface and I was outside watching when suddenly a sub surfaced just ahead of us, cutting us off. Our skipper had to reverse props fast to avoid a collision. It seems that the other sub was French and had a broom tied to the periscope, the recognized indication of a kill.<br />
<br />
97<br />
<br />
The bars that evening were full of French submarines that could do no wrong. Unfortunately, while I found myself always well accepted when working with the Navy personnel of all ranks, I felt very much out of place in the bars in the evening. Not really any place for a civilian.<br />
<br />
The movie, PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT, stated that the experiment was for the purpose of making a ship invisible to radar. Radar was not a major problem to the Navy, whereas submarines and the new type of German mine were.<br />
<br />
It appears that the true Philadelphia Experiment was planned in part at least, by Dr. Horton and others at Bell Lab and people at the underwater sound lab that we worked with in the communications experiment. The IX97 must have been the minesweeper involved since what other reason would there have been for the third overhead 'degaussing' cable?<br />
<br />
The amazing happening just a few months before our experiment was the constant scuttlebutt conversation during meals and idle time as our boats moved in and out of the New London harbor. The stories were about the disappearance and movement of the IX97 and disturbing results that led the skipper and experimenters to quickly shut down the experiment when they suddenly found themselves at the dock in Newport News.<br />
<br />
Navy operators and undoubtedly at least one civilian in charge of the experiment may have been completely enclosed in the inner ships cabin space and 'went along for the ride' with no ill effects. The IX97 may have stayed in Norfolk long enough for those frightened operators of the experiment, enclosed in the space, to see where they were and suddenly turn off the power bringing the ship back to Philadelphia yards. Unfortunate sailors on deck or the dock must have been partly moved in time giving them the mind disturbing space separation of Fig. l5.lb.<br />
<br />
One most unfortunate mate fell FROM the deck to a position where he was trapped in the steelwork. Part of his body was inside and part outside of a cowling just forward of a port side cabin door There was fresh paint on the inside and outside of this curved cowling<br />
<br />
The main cabin formed the research room housing our experimental gear. The bridge was above us. A small room towards the stern housed three special looking generators motor driven FROM ships power. Controls for these generators were in the back of the main cabin. The IX97 was very cramped whereas the Sardonix was deluxe with a lounge, kitchen, officers mess and quest bedrooms.<br />
<br />
98<br />
<br />
More sophisticated equipment may have been involved in preparing the minesweeper than that described here. I had the sense of a quick experiment gotten together in a matter of a few months and must have been rather simple addition to the 'standard' minesweeper. Since we needed all the minesweepers we could get INTO active service, it surely was the IX97 which made the time trip and was kept out of duty a few months longer for our experiment with FM/SSB communications.<br />
<br />
I believe three phase currents were placed through the wires at a low frequency. This frequency could have been at one of the earth's resonances recognized by Tesla and first measured by Schulman. The frequencies were approximately 7.5, 14 and 21 Hz. I believe the generators operated over this range of frequencies.<br />
<br />
Both in space ships per HYPOTHESES, and in the experiment, this twisting field must be necessary to break the field of strong force lines and create an inner space separated FROM universal space. Once separated, the inner space containing the ship apparently moved about two weeks back to a time when the ship was berthed at Norfolk VA. As they gradually eased the power up, the experimenters found that lower power levels had no noticeable effect. Suddenly a threshold was crossed and, wham, they traveled back two weeks in time instead of the desired 15 minutes or so needed to get out of the way of a mine. Actually they may have hoped just to levitate or teleport and did not recognize the possibility of time travel.<br />
<br />
The idea of a discontinuity in the power level vs. travel function fits perfectly in support of the divided space hypothesis of Chapter 13. As the current level in the three cables is increased, force lines begin to tear between the ship and universal space. Only when the level reached the point that all lines were broken was the IX97 free FROM the pull of the earth and the time of the present. Once free, the boat was free to suddenly go wherever it is that things within a divided space go. In the case of the IX97, that place was two weeks back in time to the place where it was at berth in Newport News. Turning the power off when the skipper saw what had happened reconnected the divided space to universal space, jerking the boat back to the Philadelphia Navy yard harbor. The return of the IX97 to Philadelphia was within seconds of the time it left, not in 1984 as in the science fiction version released to movie houses in 1984.<br />
<br />
100<br />
<br />
It could be that the jump point uses less energy if the frequency of the rotating magnetic field is synchronous with the Earth's Schulman resonant frequency. Tesla may have known of the relationship of the Earth's resonance but not to the depth of predicting the results of The Experiment. Besides Tesla passed away in 1943 and may not have been personally involved in the experiment. The frequency may have been varied along with the power level. With the power up and nothing going on, a small change in frequency may have moved INTO a well of high sensitivity equivalent to, say, a ten fold increase in power. The 'Q' of the earth's resonances may be known to some readers and may well be between 10 and 100.<br />
<br />
The size of the three generators in the rear of the IX97 were about that of a 50 horsepower 60 Hz motor. Scaled down to 7.5 Hz, the power used may have been about 15Kw. Let's assume a weight of 1500 tons for the 1X97 and one kW equivalent to one horsepower. This gives l5xl03watts/3xl06 pounds = 5 milliwatts per pound. This is exactly the ORDER of magnitude one can assume for a human who can levitate and teletransport without 'frying their brain'! And so another piece of the puzzle of HYPOTHESES fits together!<br />
<br />
It seems clear that the power used was far greater than needed if the phenomena were only better understood at the time. All that was intended was to move the minesweeper a mile or so out of the way of the mine, corresponding to a time movement of a few minutes. It then could be kept there until the mine surfaced and was destroyed. Of course those details were not worked out since first it was necessary to find out whether the ship could, indeed, be quickly moved. One must remember that, at the time, we were losing the war and especially a lot of shipping of material and troops to England. There was only time for one quick experiment as the minesweeper was vitally needed using the older technology with the expected high fatality rate. Knowing what was known after The Experiment, the sailors on the deck could have been either sent off the ship or back inside before removing power in Newport News. We didn't know, however. The sailors who were injured by the experiment had little choice which could have improved their chance of survival.<br />
<br />
The Philadelphia Experiment was much like the atom bomb, it could either explode with a very large bang or it could fizzle. Some very forward looking scientists, starting with Fermi realized that. As a result, the Manhattan program was organized FROM the start on the grand scale required. The bomb program could not creep in the methodology still followed by conventional science FROM a small bang in a test tube and gradually building to a bang of the size desired. Likewise, neither can the jump INTO divided space be made by the conservative scientific approach.<br />
<br />
101<br />
<br />
The Philadelphia Experiment must send a message to the free scientific world that profess all progress as creeping carefully along a path a step at a time with careful peer approval of each step. They will never reach the world of levitation, teleportation and time travel that way!<br />
<br />
HYPOTHESIS: Movement of a space INTO a divided space may be accomplished by creating a rotating magnetic field within the space. Separation of the divided space will occur suddenly above a line which is a function of the strength and the frequency of the field. The shape of the line will be that of a simple resonance of a cavity which in this case is the resonance of the earth's atmosphere. Once the space is divided, objects within the space may levitate, teleport or move in time. Parameters controlling the mix of these effects are unknown to the authors at present.<br />
<br />
The authors suggest that the effect of the rotating magnetic field is to create a vortex in the neutrino field. We suggest that gifted humans produce the vortex by causing the DNA molecules in the body cells to form a spiral configuration. The neutrinos follow this configuration in sufficient number to create the separated space.<br />
<br />
Using nanotechnology it may be possible to create a curved surface of tiny moveable heavy metal surfaces so as to create a divided space that can be switched on and off by control of the moveable surfaces.<br />
<br />
HYPOTHESIS: If two rotating magnetic fields are operated in synchronism with one moving clockwise and the other counter clockwise objects within one such space can be moved to the other space when power is applied.<br />
<br />
This would be the fundamental principle of operation of the teleporter stations said to be operational between Eglin AFB and a base in Australia.<br />
<br />
It may be that the bodies of the sailors on the deck of the IX97 had become separated INTO a number of isolated spaces as shown in Fig. 15.3. Here, the areas marked by % are in a first zone, by $ in a second, by # in a third, by + in a fourth, by @ in a fifth and in * in a sixth. If so, heat and nerve signals could not flow across the dividing boundaries. It is easy to visualize the disruption of the functioning of a body so divided.<br />
<br />
QUESTION: Is the drastic effect experienced by sailors participating in The Philadelphia Experiment related to conditions of mental patients in general? Could something be learned FROM reports of the experiment if they could be declassified? Surely this 54 year old information could now be made available to the mental health industry if requested for possible use in the free portion of our scientific community.<br />
<br />
102<br />
<br />
HYPOTHESIS: If an effect as shown in Fig. 15.3 can be produced magnetically, surely some physicist can find a way to re-couple all of the strong force lines within a human body. Intuitively this seems no more difficult than a cat scan. If this is found to be a factor in mental illness, the procedure would certainly be beneficial. A procedure should be possible that is essentially without risk; surely so as compared to electric shock therapy.<br />
<br />
I clearly remember the scuttlebutt among those of us working together in New London concerning the experiments and I had no reason not to believe the stories which included men trapped in steelwork and men with very serious mental disorders. The mealtime and free time conversations may or may not have included Dr. Horton, but I believe that some did. As to the validity of the scuttlebutt concerning the ship moving experiment, I can only say that jokes of this kind simply were not made up during the war. Besides, how could one hoax a story involving so many people?<br />
<br />
The Experiment could well have been planned and carried out by civilian scientists with little involvement of the Navy, as with the work in which I was involved.<br />
<br />
Fig. 15.2a) through d) SHOW my expense account book for the trip as evidence proving my work at New London.<br />
<br />
There seem to be no rumors of the technique being developed, and used during WW2, however the Philadelphia experiment surely was not forgotten. Where has this knowledge lead in the 50 years since the end of WW2? The magnetic mine is long since obsolete or if not, highly refined. The effect noted on the minds of the sailors near the minesweeper during the experiment and as illustrated by Fig. 15.3 may well have been independently developed INTO an insidious offensive anti-personnel weapon leaving little or no trace of its use.<br />

<br />
I've conducted a two year investigation INTO allegations made by scientist Alfred Bielek, Preston Nichols &amp; Peter Moon (authors of the Montauk Project book series) and other people regarding ultra-top-secret experiments carried out by clandestine units of government intelligence and military agencies, corporations such as A.I.L., Siemens/ITT, as well as certain divisions of Brookhaven Labs and other groups FROM the 1950s up to present times. These activities are by all indications currently ongoing at a fully verified and documented subterranean facility beneath the purportedly abandoned and derelict Montauk Air Force Station. The radar station is at the extreme eastern tip of Long Island, N.Y.'s south fork.<br />
<br />
The remnants of the surface military installation are indeed in severe disrepair, but the underground continues to be active. Ludicrously enough, the surface of the land is now a N.Y. State Park ... on paper at least. However by terms of the deed, the Federal government still retains all rights to any and all property beneath the surface! Investigations reveal that several new, deeper levels have been added in the early 1990s. Fields of research conducted there are said to include psychotronics (interfacing mind &amp; machine), particle beams, electromagnetic mind control, black-hole simulations and interdimensional/time travel experiments (warping time and space). Very strong evidence indicates particle accelerators are in use there and at nearby facilities -- such as Brookhaven Labs -- for powering particle beam weapons, HAARP transmissions and exotic particle beam radar systems.<br />

The continuing lack of any credible explanation for what caused the crash of TWA Flight 800 over a year ago offshore FROM Westhampton has focused considerable attention on eastern Long Island as a place where unusual things happen unusually often. In fact, there are substantial indications that particle beam operations at Brookhaven Labs the night of July 17 1996 were in fact responsible for the disaster, and this is delved INTO in more depth within the report.<br />
<br />
I've put together the report based on personal interviews with project participants, on-site investigations at Montauk Air Force Station (Camp Hero), and extensive historical and background research. This report verifies without doubt current clandestine activities at the underground installation, as well as other locations mentioned; it includes corroborative testimony FROM area residents and visitors who have very recently had frightening encounters at this location with mysterious, threatening unidentified security personnel toting automatic weapons.<br />
<br />
In the past year mainstream newspapers in Montauk and East Hampton have carried several articles about various aspects of the Montauk Project. For many in the area it is (unfortunately) becoming an accepted part of life there, as it has for others who have found the preponderance of solid evidence supporting allegations of highly irregular, horrific activities at Montauk Air Force Station impossible to dismiss. This is an incredible state of affairs taking place 100 miles FROM N.Y.C. &quot;underneath&quot; eastern L.I.'s sun and surf playground.<br />

::: MONTAUK AIR FORCE STATION == ACTIVE OR NOT? :::<br />
<br />

<br />
To get things started on the right note (and put the reader in the proper frame of mind) this question should be answered forthwith, as simply and directly as possible; the answer is no ... but yes: and here is the story.<br />
<br />
Within the past two years, several incidents of a deeply disturbing and highly irregular nature have occurred at or near Camp Hero/Montauk Air Force Station, an ostensibly derelict facility at the extreme eastern end of Long Island's south fork and adjacent to Montauk Point's historic lighthouse. This area is currently administered by the New York State Parks system and is in fact a designated state park, on paper at least. Two of these incidents involved women, one of whom was accompanied by her children, being accosted, harassed and threatened at gunpoint by unidentified government/military personnel while in the vicinity. They were told that they had violated top secret and restricted areas and were subject to arrest; however no arrests were made. Another such incident involving weapons happened within the past year when a young man was walking in the so-called state park. A similar event sans automatic weapons took place in mid-April of 1995 when a family walking there encountered a security agent, also unidentified, who abusively harassed the family and threatened to have them arrested for the same alleged violation; again no arrests were made. In April 1996, in an effort to bring themselves up-to-date on the status of the area, this family again entered the restricted portion of Camp Hero State Park, and they were once more approached by a non-uniformed guard who &quot;advised&quot; them that they were intruding INTO an area designated off-limits to the public, and were to leave immediately. This follows upon an inexplicably large number of similar events within recent years. There is much well-substantiated testimony extending back at least twenty-five years of bizarre, unconstitutional and horrific activities secretly conducted by shadowy government and military agencies at this location.<br />
<br />
In addition to the known military bases (U.S. Army) Camp Hero and Montauk Air Force Station, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans and records establish conclusive proof of the existence of at least four levels of subterranean facilities beneath Camp Hero, and according to informed sources up to three additional levels have been added as recently as the early 1990s. Montauk is actually geologically DISTINCT FROM the rest of Long Island and is the top of an undersea mountain, so there is plenty of bedrock to go down into. Camp Hero was a U.S. Army installation established prior to WW2, and Montauk Air Force Station was established within its perimeter as the Army phased out of the location in the 1950s. The Air Force Station was officially active only until 1969, and federal records do SHOW that no legitimate source of funding existed past that time to keep the base in operation as it's SAGE radar system had by then become obsolete, yet recovered Air Force documents and numerous witnesses verify indisputably that the Air Force Station was still active long after then.<br />
<br />
Recently much evidence has surfaced indicating that the base and the subterranean facilities were and still are used for a tremendous amount of top secret, ultra-classified research and experimentation (much of which falls under the umbrella of the code-named Phoenix Project) in quantum and particle physics (black hole simulation), super-powerful electrical fields, weather control, psychotronics (interfacing mind and machine), genetics, particle beam technology, and electronic and drug- based mind control. The preponderance of this evidence strongly suggests that a great many of these activities have been thoroughly malevolent as to both their desired ends and the means used to achieve those ends, and have utilized unwitting and even helpless subjects -- including at times, youngsters abducted FROM surrounding communities. Certain of these experiments in controlled warping of our time-space continuum had such devastating results and almost inconceivably awesome potential consequences that several project insiders conspired to sabotage the proceedings in August 1983, forcing the base's total, but as it turns out only temporary, abandonment.<br />
<br />
::: NO PICNICS AT CAMP HERO STATE PARK :::<br />
<br />
It is a matter of public record that the federal government turned the Camp Hero/Montauk A.F. Station property over to New York State for use as public park land in 1984, yet according to the terms of the deed on record at the Suffolk County offices in Riverhead, N.Y., the federal government retains all rights to all property beneath the surface of the land -- only the surface of this area was actually donated to N.Y. State. The deed also holds that the federal government can reclaim the surface of the land as well for reasons of national security, if necessary.<br />
<br />
Thirteen years after this transfer, at least 2/3 of this so-called park remain completely off-limits to the public! This itself is in fact a violation of the N.Y. State Parks' charter, and the restriction is enforced severely by a host of various authorities -- sometimes at gunpoint. Electronics technicians have monitored and recorded extremely unusual and unorthodox radio frequency and other electromagnetic transmissions emanating directly FROM this supposedly restricted and/or derelict property at the present time, which indicate activities very much like those alleged to have occurred there, and I have personally seen and heard with my own eyes and ears these bizarre and complex EM/RF signal transmissions monitored and traced by direction-finding receivers and other equipment.<br />
<br />
New telephone lines and new high capacity power lines with a gigawatt meter have been installed in this allegedly derelict and off-limits area fairly recently, and witnesses observed a highly advanced Cardion Corp. particle beam radar unit being operated on the bluffs at Camp Hero for a period of at least five months in 1994. Investigators were given several different explanations as to the reason for this FROM various Cardion (Siemens) officials, and one witness was told point-blank by a security guard there that the unit had been malfunctioning in the underground and was thus brought to the surface for testing!<br />
<br />
The electrical meter with gigawatt capability is on a structure claimed as an equipment maintenance building by State Parks officials: one the few functional buildings within the restricted area. Gigawatts of electrical power is a tremendous amount of power -- enough to run a large city, but where is the city at Montauk Point? Underground, apparently. Investigators of clandestine activities there assert that if gigawatts of electricity were discharged (utilized) within that single building it would be completely demolished by fire in record time. They point to the existence of the power line and gigawatt meter as clear evidence of secret, and by extrapolation unconstitutional, illicit operations at the A.F. Station. In June 1996 this assertion was confirmed as fact by a serviceman (who wishes to retain confidentiality) for LILCO, the electric utility company for the Montauk area (and virtually all Long Island). A linesman and meter reader for the Camp Hero vicinity, he has stated for the record that he and his supervisors are indeed aware that a tremendous amount of electricity is utilized by this power line and recorded by the meter. He also noted that it is absolutely not possible for the one maintenance building to use that much power for equipment maintenance operations or any other conceivable and legitimate State Parks activities.<br />
<br />
::: STRANGE SCIENCE FACT :::<br />
<br />
There are a number of claims being made about this location by people like Preston Nichols, a radio-electronics engineer and technician who's worked for Bookhaven National Laboratories and top-secret defence contactor A.I.L. on Long Island.<br />
<br />
Nichols has co-authored three books on the subject of the activities at Montauk Air Force Station popularly known as the Montauk Project. The research and experimentation alleged to have occurred in the subterranean facility beneath Camp Hero, which include psychotronic and electromagnetic mind control operations of a very extreme nature, and also interdimensional and time manipulations and travel, may no doubt strike some readers as bordering on science fiction. However, a careful perusal of numerous investigative reports and news stories, Congressional hearings, scientific papers, and relevant federal documents will SHOW that in fact many different types of electromagnetic mind manipulation technologies have been thoroughly tested and developed by intelligence agencies and other groups; the trail goes back a good fifty years or more and these technologies are well understood, quite effective, and in widespread use. As well, a complete study of the more recent concepts and developments in quantum physics shows very widespread support for theories which provide for the possibility, even likelihood, of the development of methods to accomplish travel both in time and in other dimensions. For example, in March 1994 Scientific American published a paper by David Deutsch and Michael Lockwood which concluded flatly that nothing in the currently known laws of physics prohibits such excursions. In fact, the burden of proof is now far and away upon the doubters of time and dimensional travel to make their case that such are impossible. A number of the great minds in contemporary physics -- including but not limited to Nick Herbert, Kip Thorne, Frank Tipler, Fred Allen Wolf, Michio Kaku, Steven Hawking (a recent and enthusiastic convert) and Paul Halpern -- postulate that time travel can in fact be achieved. It can be said conclusively, proven beyond any doubt within the framework of contemporary science, that parallel dimensions exist -- probable realities to us, apparently infinite in number; our familiar 3D time/space continuum is but one manifestation.<br />
<br />
Fundamentally, it is our consciousness which in some way literally brings INTO being the dimension or reality we experience, manifesting it FROM what are to us realms of infinite potentials. This was demonstrated in a mathematical form known as Von Neumann's Proof, developed by Hungarian-born physicist Janus Eric Von Neumann and published in the 1930's in his book The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Physics, known even today as &quot;the bible&quot; among quantum physicists. (More about Von Neumann later.) Other developments have demonstrated that time as it is commonly conceived of, a linear progression FROM past to present to future, does not ultimately exist.<br />
<br />
Experiments conducted at Columbia University in the early 1970s proved that a decision made by an observer/researcher which determines whether or not a photon has traveled as a wave or a particle (by either causing or not causing wave interference), and which is made after the photon is emitted INTO a multi- mirrored device (which considerably delays its journey), will also determine the state of that photon at the time it is emitted -- showing that the present does affect the past and thus the future can affect the present. Therefore all time is in actuality simultaneous; what we call past and future exist &quot;now&quot;. The past isn't gone and the future isn't yet to come. Then where are they? In another dimension. Similar alterations to traditional concepts about space, in particular vast distances, must ensue FROM such scientifically accepted facts.<br />
<br />
Another body of research used extensively in top secret projects involving ultra-advanced technologies is that of Nikola Tesla, a towering scientific genius and the true father of our present- day AC electrical system, who as far back as the turn of the century had reportedly developed such technologies as particle beam and antigravity devices, wireless power transmission, psychotronics, and &quot;free&quot; energy, to name a few. Much of his work remains only dimly comprehended by many scientists even today. Tesla and his inventions figured prominently in the legendary &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot; which was in fact part of the Phoenix Project research.<br />
<br />
It must be pointed out to those revisionists who discount the reality of the Philadelphia Experiment and also to those whose minds boggle at the contemplation of such subjects, that there is ample evidence in the public record alone, (newspapers, magazines, periodicals, etc.), showing that in the later 1930s and early 1940s Naval Intelligence and other agencies were indeed wholeheartedly researching radar cloaking technology with the top minds in physics, including John Hutchenson, Emil Kurtenhour, Albert Einstein, Von Neumann and Tesla. Although not often discussed then or now, literal sight invisibility was also a subject of considerable interest in this work. Sites for this research were first the University of Chicago and then later The Institute for Advanced Studies, a front organization for groups connected to the one-world government conclave -- the Council of Rhodes.<br />
<br />
It's perhaps noteworthy that Tesla maintained research facilities at Shoreham, Long Island, not far FROM Montauk. Shoreham is reputed to be a geomagnetic &quot;hot spot&quot; or power point, although not of the same magnitude as Montauk is. This subject will be explored more later in this report.<br />
<br />
::: PANDORA'S BOX :::<br />
<br />
Some of the most startling information now available regarding such highly classified research and experimentation in ultra- advanced physics, the resultant technologies, and the uses to which such were put can be found in the Montauk Project book series by Preston Nichols and Peter Moon, which provide extensive details on recent activities of the Phoenix Project. Following the Philadelphia Experiment in 1943, an early attempt at &quot;Stealth&quot; (radar invisibility) and according to some sources literal invisibility as well, which by most accounts ended in uncontrollable and nightmarish failure, such interdimensional research was put on hold while the A-bomb was developed and WW2 was fought and won, certainly against Japan. (In regard to the war against Nazi Germany, however, the outcome was not as clear- cut and decisive as the history books might have one believe -- certainly no atomic bombs were dropped -- and we shall find out more about this further on.)<br />
<br />
In the late 1940s, realizing that the Phoenix Project lines of research, if properly harnessed, controlled and developed, had astonishing and un-dreamed-of possibilities, clandestine government agencies reopened Pandora's Box.<br />
<br />
The worst problems encountered during the Philadelphia Experiment were the extraordinarily destructive and bizarre effects on the human beings who were aboard the battleship used in the experiment. The ship and crew allegedly disappeared FROM sight for some time: devastating psychological damage as well as horrifying physical results such as sailors being embedded in the metal of the ship when it did reappear (rematerialize) were reportedly some of these effects. Janus Von Neumann, who was the director of the Philadelphia Experiment, (staying on after Tesla had quit in disgust over his concern about just such effects upon people) was called upon to find out more regarding how human beings were impacted by entering other time-space dimensions and to develop technology which could allow people to do so without severe damage. Von Neumann, who unlike Tesla had little use for metaphysics or parapsychology, soon found himself unable to avoid coming to terms with both the psychic and spiritual aspects of human beings in addition to the material or physical level. Suffice it to say that some element of a person, often called a spirit or soul, must remain in sync with his/her original time-space lock which begins at the time of physical conception (incarnation) while transferring to or returning FROM other dimensions, if such wide scale destructive results are to be avoided. Von Neumann, exercising once again his prodigious mental abilities, came up with the world's first electronic computer, which had the capability to calculate certain time- space referencing factors with absolute precision -- a necessity for what was to be accomplished; in addition, psychotronic equipment was created which could receive, reconfigure and transmit radio-type frequencies generated by thoughts FROM the human mind (frequencies which do exist and can be picked up by what are commonly called &quot;psychics&quot; (no, they're not all phony); and by extension, devices which could externally and artificially alter or &quot;control&quot; people's minds.<br />
<br />
Among the early objectives of the Phoenix Project have been (and are still! &lt;see info on Project HAARP further on&gt;) achieving weather control capabilities. Secret agencies of the U.S. government and groups associated with such received a big boost in this area, and in development of psychotronic technologies in general, FROM the research and work of Wilhelm Reich, a veritable genius in a variety of fields; scientific, medical, psychological and metaphysical. Reich demonstrated by extensive experimentation that a form of electromagnetic energy he termed &quot;orgone&quot; energy had a significant impact on psychological states of mind as well weather conditions. Regarding the latter, Reich donated his &quot;cloud-busting&quot; technology to the U.S. government for no financial compensation, as he himself was pursuing other implications of his discoveries. (Partly due to pressure FROM the A.M.A., Reich was mercilessly hounded and harassed by federal agents and his Long Island laboratory and research destroyed; he was in fact imprisoned for, among other charges, practicing medicine without a license.) Reich's weather control technology was utilized and further developed by the government, and integrated with other aspects of the Phoenix Project.<br />
<br />
A number of researchers including Preston Nichols assert that the Phoenix Project technologies were developed and perfected to a high degree, to a large extent at facilities on Long Island such as Brookhaven National Labs. Much of this was legitimately funded until the late 1960s when Congress, upon being informed by Brookhaven Labs, Siemens/ITT, A.I.L. and other contractors of the advanced developmental state of, and great effectiveness of, the psychotronic and mind control aspects of the project, prudently decided to end such research at once and for good lest such technology fall INTO the wrong hands and be used in unacceptable ways. This may have been one of the few recent Congressional actions displaying any real backbone, but unfortunately, the technology was already in the &quot;wrong&quot; hands. Dismayed by the action of Congress, project directors approached certain members of the intelligence and military hierarchies in secret and unconstitutionally conspired to continue this experimentation, again in secret, at the recently closed down Montauk Air Force Station. Janus Von Neumann was once more made senior scientific director as the Phoenix Project avenues of research were taken to extraordinary new heights. This, the so-called &quot;Montauk Project&quot; specifically, dealt for the most part with psychotronic and inter- dimensional areas of experimentation. Electro-magnetic mind control experiments using high-powered radio frequency transmissions were conducted continually upon visiting servicemen and women &quot;invited&quot; to the base for R&amp;R; upon the population at large in surrounding communities; and most incredibly, upon numerous abducted children.<br />
<br />
There are definite indications and testimony that the Montauk Point military facilities were the site of psychological and mind (control) research even before 1969; according to researchers Camp Hero had been known as a psych base ever since its inception not long after the federal government acquired the land in 1910 through outright trickery, fraud and deception practiced against its rightful owners -- the Montauk Indian tribe.<br />
<br />
Substantial evidence FROM numerous sources shows that our federal government's intelligence agencies are responsible for an astonishing assortment of mind control experiments and projects, dating back at least 50 years. The Napa (CA) Sentinel ran a lengthy series in 1991 which provided a fairly comprehensive overview of the general &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; in mind control activities in the U.S.; the Washington Post has run some good coverage on the CIA's and NSA's hellacious abuses in this field. The Church (Senate) Committee hearings during the 1970s INTO the practices of the CIA, NSA and the like in such matters really only scratched the surface of a sordid, brutal and little-known aspect of the U.S. intelligence services' record in this type of experimentation -- almost always involving complete abject abuse of and disregard for constitutional, civil and human rights. In 1994 the Senate Committee on Veteran's Affairs (chaired by John D. Rockefeller) held hearings INTO the practices of military and intelligence groups regarding their use of unwitting, unsuspecting subjects in a substantial portion of the so-called research done INTO fields such as testing the effects of chemical/biological weapons and the uses of drugs and configured EM/RF transmissions in mind (and body) control.<br />
<br />
At Montauk, to simplify considerably, the basic research agenda was as follows. Extremely gifted and rigorously trained psychics were hooked up via psychotronic equipment to computers which converted the waveforms of their thoughts to (digital) computer code, and also relayed the waveforms to exceptionally high-powered EM/RF transmitters which broadcast thought, mind and consciousness- altering signals. According to accounts, certain experiments achieved materialization, at varying levels of stability and solidity, of objects visualized by the psychics whose thoughts were then broadcast, as well as teleportation effects. (IBM's Web site is currently &lt;5/97&gt; displaying a blurb about their research and intended development of teleportation technology.)<br />
<br />
By the late 1970s at Montauk, furthermore, very advanced experimentation was undertaken in the controlled &quot;warping&quot; of space and time, utilizing some of Tesla's (long since dead), Von Neumann's and others' ideas and inventions. Tremendously powerful electrical currents flowing in specific configurations generated electromagnetic fields which created in effect a working &quot;Tipler cylinder&quot;. To simplify once more, psychics were again utilized to visualize and stabilize a target destination in a different time/space dimension which the vortex would then be focused upon. The Tipler cylinder, a concept formulated by the aforementioned physicist Frank Tipler, is presently one of the most widely accepted theoretical models in quantum physics of how to create an artificial, controllable &quot;black hole&quot;, thereby achieving time-space and dimensional shifting and even the ability to effect alterations and manipulations of our time-space continuum.<br />
<br />
Some of this sounds quite exciting, amazing, even wonderful, and certainly in some ways it probably is. However, to a great extent such activities were and are done with absolutely no regard for the effects on the people experimented upon; furthermore, this work is done with the full intention of using the knowledge and capabilities gained to more thoroughly and completely subjugate humanity with ever-more-powerful and pervasive control of our consciousness: in fact, and literally if we remember Von Neumann's Proof, &quot;reality engineering&quot;. According to Nichols, an unquestionably brilliant radio- electronics engineer who worked often in the Montauk Project in an altered state of mind while simultaneously employed by Brookhaven National Labs (such alternate awareness can be achieved with variations of psychotronic technologies) -- and also according to other first-hand participants in certain of these experiments -- some of the youngsters abducted and so viciously abused in these activities died as a result and were buried en masse on site! The human tragedy attested to here begins to rival such indelible atrocities as the Pol-Pot massacres or Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen in its horror and brutality. The fact that this was done to American children on American soil by agencies connected, however tenuously, to our government is virtually unimaginable; yet as we have discovered, many of the assertions made by Phoenix/Montauk investigators have been checked out and verified.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, the Montauk Project crashed and burned in August 1983, sabotaged FROM within by certain key participants who could no longer tolerate what was going on. A time tunnel type link- up with the Philadelphia Experiment exactly forty years previously (August 12, 1943) was allegedly achieved then -- apparently an attempt by project operators to REPAIR or undo damage they felt had been done to the time-space continuum during the 1943 experiment; thereafter, the project ended temporarily, as described, with the surface of the property being then donated to N.Y. State.<br />

As a continuation of the previous one, the Montauk Project explored the human conscienceness and its ability to manipulate time and reality, as well as the minds of others under its influence by amplication through a computer system. The scientists there also were rumored to have imprinted this signal onto a large spherical radio scalar sphere (like a large lightning ball). With this they were able to create a portal. These projects supposabily ended in 1983 with the closing of the base as the result of a project losing control. But is it still going on, are minds still being controlled and time and reality as we know it being manipulated? Is the HAARP project the next step in this project to control the largest scalar sphere of all in the core of this planet to manipulate all space\/time?
