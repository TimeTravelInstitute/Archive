								<div class="bbWrapper">Simply without argumentation, I am going to lay out this past said use of time travel misuse case.I am asking that you the reader, simply note the track of this misuse and record this for your interest, only.<br />
<br />
The subject of concern, was assigned to live on Earth.This is without being offered an indication to being subjected to alternative solutions, made of use before hand.<br />
A series of beings popularly known as the Pleiadeans, at one time were associated with colonization on Earth.<br />
They were also manifest in the once known Empire as the Atlantians, which was said to be a fourth density sect of beings that had come here from the Lyra Constellation. But know however, after coming here from the old Lyrian wars and social con-strife, their lighter density, had spun down to the third density, which is now common experienced today.<br />
<br />
The Atlantians have many differing relations that are handed down to this society relatively current to this posting date.<br />
<br />
A sect of these beings had shown up in Europe and participated in a very public landing, which was subjected to not only questioning as to why they had showed here, but their motive designs and wants, as well.<br />
<br />
They had one female cosmonaut that shared a common fraternal trait to an Earth human, who at the time, was in residence as an american citizen.This relationship between the female cosmonaut and male earthling, was one of past fraternal twins, joining a common familial route.<br />
<br />
The female had traveled back in timer with a Swizz citizen, to the time of the dinosaur, it is believed to be the cretaceous period of time, to where this cosmonaut had showed the Swiss citizen how to stun a dinosaur and to look around in that period of time, as a sort of a field trip a little.<br />
The female Pleiadean did not travel there by herself and the Swiss well known citizen, as the U.S. subject was starting to genetically pair with her, in a very strong bond.<br />
<br />
What this action had done, was to give the Earth human almost all of her information. This sharing, both mental and physical, except to gene codes to turn into a woman, as the subject was a male. During the visit to this time, is metamorphically when the human, at that point very became very sick, because he was under the full bio-genetic flux of the predominate gene of hers.This was because she had been the initiator.<br />
<br />
This new status of his now reclaimed sister, began to experience during the period of change, the time travel location as well as environment in that period of time, to where he said, &quot;The air was very thick, heavy like molasses and almost difficult to breath.<br />
<br />
Part of him materialized with him on his knees, wearing only a tee shirt and his underwear briefs.This was on a creature trail, which was in the very ancient Earth period of the dinosaurs.This appearance and the experience lasted for about a minutes time.The rules were, that since he was now bio-genetically bonded to his sister, that he had to go where she was physically traveling at the time.The time scope, was that of the Earth itself, regardless of time and era being involved.<br />
<br />
During the time of time travel into the past, she and her Swiss companion journied through the era of the junk vampire plagues.This was posing a problem to where her family gene route, never had exposure to the 1600s junk vampire era. which is NOT a clan vampire affectation.<br />
This is given in the book, (Vampires A study in case histories), an experience that he family root had not gone through.The manufacture was of the Indian made for retribution of the past Indian Atlantian conflicts, use of nuclear weapons.<br />
His resistance to the, (now), hybrid vampire bio-genetic plague virus, was all of a sudden no longer there. So the subject started with a few years time passed landings started to turn into a full phased, hybrid vampire.<br />
<br />
These conditions were started as a dramatic increased in physical strength, acute hearing, of being able to pick up whispers at fifty feet in distance and a tracking and wanting taste for human blood.The subject not only could track humans from their blood smell taste via odor, but another part of him, his tracking sense, would plot attack solutions on humans to track and attack them for their blood.<br />
<br />
There were also changes in the canine tooth topographies of teeth, which would enable him to quill blood up from a human jugular vein.*A supposed covert meeting was convened and the decision had been made to use a large flying laboratory gown bat. This would be to deliver a stop rate of change bite inoculation, by a house cat sized bat, which was delivered to the right male breast, which combined, with the auto-gennic immunity, and simply arrested the continuance of the vampiric bio-gennic change.<br />
This act rescued the subject and he could not continue his process becoming a &quot;by vampire terms, &quot;a loose vampiric hybrid cannon, that did not choose to follow clan rules&quot;..Everyone was happy.<br />
<br />
Some security org. had found out about this change and simply arrested it with an anti-vampire virus, which stop the full reversion into a class one active predatory hybrid.This is a condition to where a black funnel during sleep, opens beneath the changling, and the spirit soul complex will either go down into this funnel, which means active vampire state, or be yanked away out of that black funnel, which means back to human being.<br />
<br />
The Pleiadean woman came back from her time travel expierence,  but later in time had sustained damage to the base of her skull from an unseen by more than one witness falling to the floor. So she had died as estimated in the early 2000 nds. The now dramatically changed human adopted her physical traits, such as allergies to pollins.This is as her home world, had little of these.There was also a change in his body in not knowing, or realizing what cheese is, which acts as glue does within the confines of his body.*There may be other changes not known at this time, e.g. posting date?<br />
<br />
What is not known is, as to whether this appaearance by them, had been a willful act performed by the Pleiadeans, or an accident?This situation to where they simply were not aware of what they were doing.Technically this many is legally a Pleiadean Citizen, even though he lives on Earth as a citizen as based in the United States.So because of his dramatic physical change, in some way, should be covered by a comprehensive health care-case act, which also mixed some social aspects of modern Pleiadean awareness and physiology, to be blended in with his new changed identity.<br />
<br />
What is given here, is an example of the time traveler tag-along phenomenon, which can manifest into an individual and rarely, into a small group of people at times.<br />
<br />
This disclosure is simply for your notes.It is not known, but best guessed that the travel route exposure, other than the erasure of the vampiric resistance to the Junk Vampire Plagues, had been the only environmental change caused, then cured by a hidden, not known of or guessed at organization. This unguessed ediface, as a hidden in actuary, within the United States.*This statement means, please do not attempt to disclose this organization with reaserch.<br />
<br />
This phenomenon track, may be worked on in display in simulation in the complex range. Or for fun, within the simplified range, such as in a similar frame of reference to the Kerbal simulated games and or strategies by computer constructs.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">*Technical notes; for time travel aficionados as well as historians.At this level of time-cast, the Pleiadeans as well as other off worlders have certain abilities vested within their space vehicles in order to be able to time travel.One method that is recorded on archival store, such as in (Rosales humanoids contacts list), is to simply accelerate towards Earth's moon and there is both a technical device within the flying saucer and or vested in that combination of movement of the saucer's track, that allows the saucer to move both forwards and backwards in time.<br />
<br />
The second method and this was demonstrated with the use of the latest Pleiadean sonic beam-ships, is to selected entry into a time travel vernier, or route of time going backwards into time.This is roughly the same method of technologies used by the said U.S. Navy DE world war two heavily modified by Tesla &amp; Einstein escort destroyer naval ship. However with its crew time space compensated, which in the interior of the modern to this posting date, cupola of the saucer.This allows the time travelers to be protected from the raceway effect, which was experienced by the DE class Eldrige Destroyer, in accessing a time traveler gross radiation of all kinds corridor.This direction had been to the fifty thousands, way into Earth future. So the operating crew does not suffer ill effects and can remain their characteristics upon reaching their target destinations.*Eldrige 1940's said invisibility time travel experiment.<br />
<br />
Also know at this time, because of the fade of genetic perfection genetic modifications to the humanoid body, as it seems occurred at the end of the large space wars from the rough approximate *Lyrian said space wars.This is said after these wars, genetic engineering became very popular, in order to allow certain groups to live extended lives longevity-wise.This practice had caused what is described as blocking bars, or non-Gregor Mendel at random from the wall of gene availability as based within the DNA inner structure to long helical bars, or known as, (Mendel's genetic source wall) and there became an addiction to this practice. *Syntax said, pronounced Leer-e-ain, or Lyrian, modern way of saying word of this race.<br />
<br />
History just did not occur as the Pleiadeans had said, that they were superior, so could live longer situation foisted upon Earth human's knowledge. How the Pleiadeans manged to live longer, was that all the time they had to take stolen genetic materials from Earth humans, dish processing this as a in-vetro bath to embryo process.This method in order to make that longevity occur.<br />
So in reality the modern relative to posting date Pleiadeans were in reality, gene pirates, thieves. So part of the 1975 on landings in Switzerland was in part, an effort to conceal both these sect societal social intents, along with self identities. In other words, these landings had been one big social lie, so that they could keep up this self gene modifying self addiction; this action,  in order to keep themselves both to seem young and deceive Earth human society at the same time.<br />
<br />
There is a report that through one of the Sem-ya-zee;s freinds, who was one of the principles at the Swiss 75 European landings. Later, that they were going to go to the Andromedians, which were their friends and phase out of using the human body all together, so replacing this once physical body with an electric grid representation appearing like or similar to a real human.Nobody knows as to whether this did, or did not occur. *See Lia, in UFO Photo Archive's book, UFO Contact From Andromeda.<br />
<br />
It was said that through some unknown both formula and procedure, that the real father of what we refer to as in this time as the Emperor or Darth Vader's father, had in some way a bent genetics program, or character placed to him. This effect was expressed as that to be naturally and without fuss, had allowed him to reach the age of 900 years in age, without genetic concockshun. It is not known as to where said Darth Vader ever had carried on this trait within him.This may have been why the Pleiadeans could have been interested in the subject from the primary telling, or this relayed story?Or for that matter even be looked upon as an enemy to the Pleiadeans state, due to the fear that this subject would in some way interfere with the Pleiadeans genetic habit conquest plan?_However supposed Vader may have already been heavily modified and it would not be known if he had carried his father's longevity trait at all, or could a normal human ever utilize this trait?<br />
<br />
*Sources for the say in Star Wars materials for the age of the Emperor. This was said by two apparent technicians then, looking into the into the time tunnel, which was phase into development out of the Montauk series of experiments.This move into the time tunnel phase of this sanctioned reach into the future and this speak had occurred as said, (His father lived to be a really old age.)This was at TTI and said transferred to other knowledge bases in other time travel forums.Quote, &quot;He was something like over seven hundred years in age and nobody knows how he could have manged to have done this? We could see back into that time, but because they were so advanced, we were ordered to stay within observation mode of operations only&quot;. Preston Nicholes verifies that there was a said Time Tunnel which was phased as an outgrowth off of the predecessor, the Montauk time travel linear accelerator and time travel chair, which was for a short depth, till activated to be defined as stage 2 utility technologies, allowing better access than the previous Montauk time travel chair.3.The television series The Time Tunnel, was in essence a socially deceptive flair, which was to act in the real relative anchor of time allowance departures, which acted as a typing paper cover-sheet, to the real doings that had transgressed out of Montauk, so making the general public unless they either guessed of somehow knew what was really going on, with the potential of being dismissed as made up fiction.</div>

</div>They figure and I have researched this that the period of Star Wars was 1,800 years ago.That would bring the vast space based wars closer to this time.This is just when they may have been finishing them out.<br />
<br />
What has recently been discovered, is that there are free rouge AI programs leftover from that era, already hiding in our societies computer infrastructure. These programs know what their doing and what they look for in some instances are people that are reincarnated from that past time, as they once knew them.<br />
<br />
Then, AI was very common and was closer to people than is the case now; almost similar to how pet claves to people. This resurfaces the question, well' if these programs are still here, then what about the Darth Vader character, was he both real and of any consequence?<br />
<br />
The answer is yes, very much so. As the heirs from that time are not all accounted for.The most dangerous factor here is who Vader used to know and how extensive does this factor become?<br />
<br />
I can't go beyond this point as your society thinks it knows everything and is about to make colossally huge mistakes.</div>

			They figure and I have researched this that the period of Star Wars was 1,800 years ago.That would bring the vast space based wars closer to this time.This is just when they may have been finishing them out.<br />
<br />
What has recently been discovered, is that there are free rouge AI programs leftover from that era, already hiding in our societies computer infrastructure. These programs know what their doing and what they look for in some instances are people that are reincarnated from that past time, as they once knew them.<br />
<br />
Then, AI was very common and was closer to people than is the case now; almost similar to how pet claves to people. This resurfaces the question, well' if these programs are still here, then what about the Darth Vader character, was he both real and of any consequence?<br />
<br />
The answer is yes, very much so. As the heirs from that time are not all accounted for.The most dangerous factor here is who Vader used to know and how extensive does this factor become?<br />
<br />
I can't go beyond this point as your society thinks it knows everything and is about to make colossally huge mistakes.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</div>If you want the exact infraction then here it is.Say for instance I was Darth Vader in a former existence. And someone thinking that they were really bright, and could not only help this society, but make a bundle of money off the whole op as well, found out the link between the past Darth Vader and myself. The question looms and you should pay attention to this, is there any infraction in using a person this way?<br />
<br />
The answer is this simple.While it was probably not that bad to make up to four movies about this past era, know that distorting the past is not part and parcel of the karmic allowance. In other words, your society had done wrong.You can tell about the past, but if a number of incarnates are here under a karmic recompense principle, then you can't degrade those individuals without there being a violation.<br />
<br />
For instance, the person once known as Darth Vader may have done evil, however the exact circumstances is not known as to why issues had degraded as they had done so.In other words, one cannot adjudicate an issue of unknown depth, as if this ends up in slander, then the people performing the slandering, may be the ones to pay the penalty for doing so.<br />
<br />
There's a curse and a very bad one involved in these doings. The higher up have made this mistake and more than likely according to karmic law, they will be the ones that pay.</div>

			"articleBody": "Simply without argumentation, I am going to lay out this past said use of time travel misuse case.I am asking that you the reader, simply note the track of this misuse and record this for your interest, only.\n\nThe subject of concern, was assigned to live on Earth.This is without being offered an indication to being subjected to alternative solutions, made of use before hand.\nA series of beings popularly known as the Pleiadeans, at one time were associated with colonization on Earth.\nThey were also manifest in the once known Empire as the Atlantians, which was said to be a fourth density sect of beings that had come here from the Lyra Constellation. But know however, after coming here from the old Lyrian wars and social con-strife, their lighter density, had spun down to the third density, which is now common experienced today.\n\nThe Atlantians have many differing relations that are handed down to this society relatively current to this posting date.\n\nA sect of these beings had shown up in Europe and participated in a very public landing, which was subjected to not only questioning as to why they had showed here, but their motive designs and wants, as well.\n\nThey had one female cosmonaut that shared a common fraternal trait to an Earth human, who at the time, was in residence as an american citizen.This relationship between the female cosmonaut and male earthling, was one of past fraternal twins, joining a common familial route.\n\nThe female had traveled back in timer with a Swizz citizen, to the time of the dinosaur, it is believed to be the cretaceous period of time, to where this cosmonaut had showed the Swiss citizen how to stun a dinosaur and to look around in that period of time, as a sort of a field trip a little.\nThe female Pleiadean did not travel there by herself and the Swiss well known citizen, as the U.S. subject was starting to genetically pair with her, in a very strong bond.\n\nWhat this action had done, was to give the Earth human almost all of her information. This sharing, both mental and physical, except to gene codes to turn into a woman, as the subject was a male. During the visit to this time, is metamorphically when the human, at that point very became very sick, because he was under the full bio-genetic flux of the predominate gene of hers.This was because she had been the initiator.\n\nThis new status of his now reclaimed sister, began to experience during the period of change, the time travel location as well as environment in that period of time, to where he said, \"The air was very thick, heavy like molasses and almost difficult to breath.\n\nPart of him materialized with him on his knees, wearing only a tee shirt and his underwear briefs.This was on a creature trail, which was in the very ancient Earth period of the dinosaurs.This appearance and the experience lasted for about a minutes time.The rules were, that since he was now bio-genetically bonded to his sister, that he had to go where she was physically traveling at the time.The time scope, was that of the Earth itself, regardless of time and era being involved.\n\nDuring the time of time travel into the past, she and her Swiss companion journied through the era of the junk vampire plagues.This was posing a problem to where her family gene route, never had exposure to the 1600s junk vampire era. which is NOT a clan vampire affectation.\nThis is given in the book, (Vampires A study in case histories), an experience that he family root had not gone through.The manufacture was of the Indian made for retribution of the past Indian Atlantian conflicts, use of nuclear weapons.\nHis resistance to the, (now), hybrid vampire bio-genetic plague virus, was all of a sudden no longer there. So the subject started with a few years time passed landings started to turn into a full phased, hybrid vampire.\n\nThese conditions were started as a dramatic increased in physical strength, acute hearing, of being able to pick up whispers at fifty feet in distance and a tracking and wanting taste for human blood.The subject not only could track humans from their blood smell taste via odor, but another part of him, his tracking sense, would plot attack solutions on humans to track and attack them for their blood.\n\nThere were also changes in the canine tooth topographies of teeth, which would enable him to quill blood up from a human jugular vein.*A supposed covert meeting was convened and the decision had been made to use a large flying laboratory gown bat. This would be to deliver a stop rate of change bite inoculation, by a house cat sized bat, which was delivered to the right male breast, which combined, with the auto-gennic immunity, and simply arrested the continuance of the vampiric bio-gennic change.\nThis act rescued the subject and he could not continue his process becoming a \"by vampire terms, \"a loose vampiric hybrid cannon, that did not choose to follow clan rules\"..Everyone was happy.\n\nSome security org. had found out about this change and simply arrested it with an anti-vampire virus, which stop the full reversion into a class one active predatory hybrid.This is a condition to where a black funnel during sleep, opens beneath the changling, and the spirit soul complex will either go down into this funnel, which means active vampire state, or be yanked away out of that black funnel, which means back to human being.\n\nThe Pleiadean woman came back from her time travel expierence,  but later in time had sustained damage to the base of her skull from an unseen by more than one witness falling to the floor. So she had died as estimated in the early 2000 nds. The now dramatically changed human adopted her physical traits, such as allergies to pollins.This is as her home world, had little of these.There was also a change in his body in not knowing, or realizing what cheese is, which acts as glue does within the confines of his body.*There may be other changes not known at this time, e.g. posting date?\n\nWhat is not known is, as to whether this appaearance by them, had been a willful act performed by the Pleiadeans, or an accident?This situation to where they simply were not aware of what they were doing.Technically this many is legally a Pleiadean Citizen, even though he lives on Earth as a citizen as based in the United States.So because of his dramatic physical change, in some way, should be covered by a comprehensive health care-case act, which also mixed some social aspects of modern Pleiadean awareness and physiology, to be blended in with his new changed identity.\n\nWhat is given here, is an example of the time traveler tag-along phenomenon, which can manifest into an individual and rarely, into a small group of people at times.\n\nThis disclosure is simply for your notes.It is not known, but best guessed that the travel route exposure, other than the erasure of the vampiric resistance to the Junk Vampire Plagues, had been the only environmental change caused, then cured by a hidden, not known of or guessed at organization. This unguessed ediface, as a hidden in actuary, within the United States.*This statement means, please do not attempt to disclose this organization with reaserch.\n\nThis phenomenon track, may be worked on in display in simulation in the complex range. Or for fun, within the simplified range, such as in a similar frame of reference to the Kerbal simulated games and or strategies by computer constructs.\n\nThank you.",
