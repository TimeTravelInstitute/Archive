While Hawking Radiation does prove we exist in an E=MC2 compliant universe, this solution presents its own problems as well. Information is not lost, it re-emerges on the subatomic scale laterally over time. Someone wishing to send information back through time will have great difficulty in it reassembling on the other end at one point in the past. Of course the more time passes the more information there will be, but the results are spead out over alltime and as such has little practical use apart from helping us sleep at night.<br />
<br />
The answer to the problem of interrelatedness is solved by utilizing the doppler effect and an understanding of the principles of existing in a 4D universe. This is the dual wave property of both light and matter- to the subject, the information is sent out in every direction, to the observer it only comes in one random particle at a time in a straight line. Supernovae explosions provided the clue by shooting narrow focused pulses of lateral information in one direction- invariably in the direction of the observer (tree in the forest) and we either percieve the supernovae or we don't.<br />
<br />
When you intersect three basic principles, the limits of the universe appear to break down in isolated spots in the fourth dimension:<br />
<br />
1. Information is never gained or lost but transfered.<br />
2. Matter and energy exists in a mostly virtual state.<br />
3. Information exists in all three states but is subject to the doppler effect.<br />
<br />
As an example, imagine I am standing on the planet's surface shooting a laser beam out into space at another planet trillions of miles away. The laser beam (the information) is more efficient since it is intentionally directed but it is still subject to the conal qualities of spacetime.<br />
<br />
The information reaches the second planet and is distorted and signifigantly weaker- in traversing that distance, the information itself spread out thinly and weakly, to accomidate spacetime. And with great distances, the information itself becomes distorted, specifically on the EM Scale- this is why astronomers can &quot;hear&quot; cosmic background radiation.<br />
<br />
While it is possible to isolate, ajust and amplify that information, the key remains: what was the original information? Once you concede the unification of matter and energy it becomes a fool's effand to recieve random information and infer a specific intent- how to we ajust for this?<br />
<br />
As such, it is theoretically possible to send information to any point in spacetime and equally likely to recieve virtually any information from spacetime. This is because simply put- it's already there, we just need to figure the key code. <br />
<br />
While the key code itself lies within mutually assumed parameters, it is the responsibility of the sender to make sure the information reaches the reciever at the right place in time and in the right medium; the intended medium. For example, one can send a radio signal into the past provided several criteria are met:<br />
<br />
1. The radio signal itself is artificially amplified to compensate for spacetime.<br />
2. The signal must be calculated against spacetime to inersect with a specific target.<br />
3. The information must appear in its intended form and function at the right time and place- where the observer is.<br />
<br />
The advantage digital has over analog is simple- with digital, there are two signals: the static background signal and a very narrow directed signal. As such, the information itself becomes more directed. However, the tradeoff for digital over analog is that digital can only strengthen or weaken and by doing so distort (Heisenberg)- analog information exists laterally on a scale between gamma and dark. Furthermore, with amplification, digital information amplifies both the signal and the distortion equally resulting in Heisenbergian chaos- this is the advantage to analog, where individual signals simply get lost at the expense of the remaining unaltered information (supernovae).<br />
<br />
The solution lies within the nature of digital information itself. Since digital information is two dimensional and operates through a one dimensional, two way switch, it is possible to amplify random informaton and chaos alike and simply discern between the two to produce one signal that is 50% coherent and 50% chaos. From there you simply tune into one channel and recieve the original information as the sender intended.<br />
<br />
Here is one application.<br />
<br />
Suppose you wanted to send digital information into the past for past observers to recieve- how exactly do you do that? The answer is simple- through simple triangulation of the information itself:<br />
Points A and B are the present (the present and the after-present) and point C is a narrow, directed point in spacetime- a point in space at a time when the observer will occupy it. You send the information twice, (also taking the doppler effect into account) at the same spot (C) with the trajectories lined up to both reach point C at the same time. Point C will recieve the same information from points A and B at the same time and filter it- removing 50% of the chaos from the original information. But since the information was sent twice (from points A and B), there will be an equal amount of chaos and information from both A and B; this redundancy results in 100% information and 100% chaos.<br />
<br />
The determining factor, of course, will be the capacity of point C to discern between chaos and information and that requires proper prior planning. For that, I use the baseball batter example- baseball players twist, bend and distort their bodies in a truly awkward fashion to anticipate hitting a homerun. They do this because the simplest way to hit a homerun is to have the bat at the right space and time with the proper velocity as the ball occupies the same space resulting in a homerun. The simplest way to have the bat in the right moment in spacetime with the right velocity is for the baseball batter to bend, twist and distort his body in an awkward fashion- the batter's stance does not matter to the ball, the bat hitting the ball does. In this regard, the batter is the tool, the bat is the transmitter and the ball is the information. A batter with a good swing and good reflexes can take even a bad pitch and sent it over the right field wall.<br />
<br />
On the other end is the reciever- the fan in the bleachers. They do not have the knowledge or reflexes to hit a ball back to homeplate but they do have a glove. By distorting the batter's stance, the ball predictably flies into the outfield and lands in the fan's glove naturally. In this regard (and in the larger context), the original information is artificially distorted and sent with the belief that it will unfurl itself naturally over spacetime to arrive at point C as the original information. This cause and effect makes it possible for a baseball to travel hundreds of feet across a ballpark- something it normally cannot do. <br />
<br />
This is where the advantage digital clearly has over analog. With analog, the sender must send 200% of the original information knowing that half of it will become chaos. With digital, the sender need only send 100% of the information, but multiple times. In practical terms, this is the difference between sending information back through time and sending matter (i.e. &quot;time traveling&quot;). <br />
<br />
To send a person back in time, the sender must quantify, unify and amplify the vectors for every of the 100 trillion cells that makes up a human being and send all of this information back to point C to arrive within one invariable point in spacetime. The end result will be either 100% success or 100% failure. To do this requires post-Heisenbergian, Planck-state information which is something that may never be accomplished- it takes as much energy as is in the universe to send a person back in time to another point in the universe and will invariably result in 100% chaos at point(s) A.<br />
<br />
But sending digital information is something different entirely. By sending redundant information to point C over time, the end-result (with direct measures of success) will be increased clarity of the original information at point C. Since the information is redundant, the redundancy will counteract chaos; with enough &quot;Point A's&quot;, there will be virtually no information loss.<br />
<br />
This only brings up the second and more important principle of the state of the medium: our closed, E=MC2 universe. The very thing that makes such a thing possible also dictates that any outcomes must be logical. <br />
<br />
We will now look abstractly (laterally) with information over time. Points A (and so on) are the sender's points. All of these points intersect at point Z- where the intended recipient is- somewhere else in spacetime. Since spacetime is consistent (because E=MC2), any information sent from A to Z must be logically consistent. This is the opposite of the multiverse scenario- this is stating as a fact that there is only one tangable reality and it only exists at one moment in time (via causality). What lies between A and Z is spacetime itself- the time it will take for the information to go from A to Z and the physical distance between both points (the intersection of cones) and this is largely virtual in nature (i.e. &quot;tunneling&quot;).<br />
<br />
Points B to Y are &quot;the logical progression of time in-between A and Z&quot; and this is where the chaos lies. Since the information is digital (and operated under yes/no logic), this information traverses B to Y on its own accord- therein lies the vector factors to compensate in an A to Z trip. Case in point- if you sent the winning lottery ticket numbers back in time to yesterday to where it will be recieved then two things will happen: the numbers will be predictably correct and at the same time the steps between A and Z have been severely altered to compensate for a logically consistent A and Z. <br />
<br />
So in spacetime, what would have happened is a radically different (logically consistent) series of events that instead of whoever was going to win or not win the lottery, instead another chain of events happened which resulted in you winning. This is chaos (Schrodinger). The chaos the information recieved will create is equal to the chaos between points B and Y (Conservation), which to the sender is simply chaos (&quot;The Chaos Effect&quot;) and therein lies the contradiction.<br />
<br />
Here is another example. Suppse you sent information from 2006 back to 1941 telling the US Air Force exactly the spot where Hitler, Mussolini and Hirohito will be at a given moment (Doolittle). The Air Force will then act and eliminate all three targets and World War Two would have never happened. What will happen is a new 1941 will be written with a new future. But since this information was sent through timespace, this new history MUST be logically consistent with the original information itself- in other words, World War Two would have never happened and equally, you would have still had to have sent the information in the same manner at the same point in spacetime. This would be unpredictable chaos- B to Z will fill itself in in many unexpected ways- since the information is logical, the B to Y path must be also, as must A to Z. <br />
<br />
Now suppose you sent information back in time to a hitman- in exchange for the winning lottery numbers tomorrow, you must kill my younger self. This is the A and Z information. Successfully sending this information makes it unalterable- indeed, A and Z will occur in spacetime. This is where spacetime gets wacky- the B-Y path that connect A-Z must compensate for your sending information back in time that kills you before you were able to send the information itself. In short, a miracle must happen for this to remain universally continuitous- for example you may be killed but somehow get ressurected and get back in health just in time to send the original information back in time. Since ressurection goes against many fundemantal principles of our understanding of reality, killing your younger self would happen, but logically so would The Rapture.<br />
<br />
One effective method to successfully (and consistently) send coherent information through spacetime is to do it in a manner where there will be little chaos between points B and Y (Nostradamus). In this regard, the information will come through as predictions that have little merit until they come to pass and by then, too late to act on. Spacetime will remain cohesive and the implications of the information will remain relevant but of little practical (actionable) use in the past at point A.<br />
<br />
This is where &quot;discrete packets of targeted information&quot; comes into play. Utilizing factors that are consistent at both points A and Z, information can be sent through spacetime that will alter the past in non-chaotic, but effective ways. This is the difference between percentages and individual numbers. Giving 100,000 people tomorrow's winning lottery numbers does very little for those 100,000 people, but giving that information to one person regarding one lottery that has no historical signifigance in the future in all likliehood won't distort spacetime- the sender need only remember to send the information back in time at the right moment in spacetime in this now-altered (but still logically consistent) future, presumably from his mansion in Beverly Hills.<br />
<br />
A time traveler once had the bright idea of going back in time with his scrapbook to get the pictures and autographs of many of history's great leaders. It wasn't until he had finished that he realized the causality of his actions- how could he show provenance for objects that simply do not belong in his spacetime? How could he possibly prove this is really Mozart's autograph? Time naturally moves forward in one logically consistent fashion, on one direction: forward, at one Planck moment at a time. As such, information through spacetime must always benefit the recipient at the expense of the sender. <br />
<br />
To successfully send information from A to Z through spacetime, there must be an agreed upon understanding between both points- specifically that the information in Z will not contradict the information from A. By sending the information from A to Z, the sender (point A) hopes this information will not alter spacetime to a degree of where A cannot possibly happen (overly simplified).<br />
<br />
How would information from the future (A) be recieved, processed and acted upon? Ultimately, in a logical fashion at the Z-point. This is how the universe compensates to remove any grandfather paradoxes, because there is only one reality and one timespace (for practical purposes at least). Any A to Z transfer of information through spacetime will invariably have the following trajectory: A to B, B to Y, Y to Z, then logically back to A: A remains constant and the the flow of spacetime from A to Z then Z back to A remains logically consistent. However, B to Y is invariably altered in the process- in effect, history is rewritten to make sure A remains A.<br />
<br />
This means future predictions can only apply to the exact moment in spacetime they are percieved. In other words, you cannot say &quot;this will happen tomorrow&quot; because &quot;tomorrow&quot; is somewhere along the B-Y grid that you are distorting at the expense of a logically consistent A: the information itself. As such, information through spacetime has a natural tendency to appear illogical and even contradictory- this distortion is secondary to the primary information itself (and in higher systems, simply becomes distortion).<br />
<br />
It still has a practical function, but there is no logical way to define B-Y in any given moment in spacetime. In essense, any transfer of information between and A and Z point in any capacity ultimately breaks down to two functions: A and A(Altered) and to the neutral observer, both would appear as contradictions when they are not- they are simply two expressions that counteract each other allowing the intended information to get through. <br />
<br />
A simple visual to demonstrate this is a large room with two spotlights on opposite walls that illuminate the entire room. &quot;Well, which light is lighting the room?&quot; you ask. Both are equally- A and A(A). When you stand in the middle of this large room you are being hit equally by both lights and collectively, you have enough ambient light to see yourself. If either light was off, you would only see half of yourself- your backside would be in the dark (because your body is in the way of the light). Now we section off the center of the room so we can't see the spotlights (even though they're still shining on us)... we &quot;look down&quot; and see the floor is lit equally. &quot;Where is that light coming from?&quot; Both places at the same time. With this perspective, it is impossible to distinguish which of those two spotlights is lighting up the floor. <br />
<br />
This is how time works along spacetime- it simply flows. Spotlight A is the information from the future, spotlight A(A) is the information recieved in the past. Standing in the center of the room and looking down, you are unable to distinguish which light is which. What is happening here is two spotlights are shooting out light in a conal shape outwards until it reaches the centerpoint of the room where it meets the other light's equal cone-shaped light. Both lights cancel each other's light out and you end up with a lit room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well at what point does A's light end and A(A)'s light begin?&quot; This is the B-Y function of spacetime- it becomes theoretical (or virtual); unquantifiable. The answer depends on your perspective entirely. Irregardless, the center of the room is lit.<br />
<br />
&quot;How would information sent through spacetime be percieved in the past?&quot; Since we exist in one tangable, logically consistent, coherent universe, the only way it could is by bypassing logic itself. Suppose Biff in &quot;Back to the Future&quot; giving the younger Biff the Sports Almanac. By young Biff having this book, he has a track record of proven, logically consistent sports outcomes between points A and Z.  It is impossible for the book to remain true to its purpose- there is no way every prediction in there can be correct and keep timespace unfurling logically- eventually it will stop working (Heisenberg). <br />
<br />
Play it out- you go to the track and win every single race. Then you go to the track tomorrow and win every single race again. You keep doing this. Eventually, any of an infinite number of things will happen that will prevent you from continuing to correctly predict all the outcomes. This is because by your winning and by your defying natural odds you're altering spacetime itself- a different spacetime will HAVE TO unfurl to accomidate your winning all the time. Eventually you will win so many times the racing track will have to hire a hitman to kill you or go out of business- how could history remain unaltered if one man won a trillion dollars in a single year- it's just not possible for this to happen and spacetime to remain the same- history books will be rewritten, you'd be a celebrity... the causality of your actions alters time. <br />
<br />
However, what if someone had a Sports Almanac from the future and kept a low profile? Then you'd have a much higher likliehood of not altering the natural progression of spacetime, a greater chance that A to Z to A will make sense. Instead of winning every single race instead you only placed a modest bet once every month or so. By doing that, small gains over a long period of time would be enough to &quot;smooth over&quot; spacetime to where such a thing becomes logical; therefore it has the potential to actually happen. You won't end up a multi-trillionaire but you know your future will remain secure... you know there still is a path from Z back to A (&quot;plausible deniability&quot;).<br />
<br />
The only way to percieve the progression of time is from a historical perspective- by looking back at the (quantified) past. And for any observer, to look at the past is to look at a logical series of events that led to this exact moment. The only different perspective is that of the recipient of information from the future and the only difference will be the actual interaction with the future itself for that one moment in time. To the rest of the world, nothing out of the ordinary happened, the universe continues to flow normally. But for that one recipient, they have the insight of paths A and A(A)- only they know of the alternative future that only they can alter hence only they have the capacity to alter otherwise &quot;normal&quot; events. <br />
<br />
Not even the information's sender in the &quot;future&quot; (which is now an abstract concept) can control this information apart from the accuracy of the information itself- at this point it's all in the hands of the recipient at point Z, somewhere in the past (a sender cannot unsend a message once it's sent). From there it's all context and severity- what the implications of the information itself is and how it will alter invariable spacetime (see: The Rapture).<br />
<br />
In any regard, information from the future will appear in two different ways over spacetime to the recipient and there is no logical connection between them (&quot;the randomality of B to Y&quot;). The information came from point A and with time will once again be at point A while point Z will become something else entirely, unrealted and often times illogical to the observer at the time of observation. Imagine you're in Pearl Harbor, 1941 in charge of communications. Across your desk come all the reports that report the comings and goings of the naval base- thousands of small scraps of information that collectively adds up to &quot;the goings on&quot;. Latrine duty, military exercises, uniform requisitions and radar readings from the Pacific. All of these little pieces of information are equally valuable at the present moment and some of them are clearly more important than others (soldiers need bullets more than they need cigarettes although they need both).<br />
<br />
How could you possibly know that one radar reading was the onset of Pearl Harbor- you possibly couldn't- how could you predict at that moment in time that this one piece of information will become so signifigant in the coming hours? You couldn't!<br />
<br />
This is the advantage a reciever of information from spacetime would have- they would know outcomes A and A(A) and could clearly see the difference between the two. It wouldn't take much to connect this radar blip to the Japanese army once you knew they were coming. There is no way this person could know about A(A) so this little piece of information finds its own way to some dusty cabinet until the naval inspectors come back years later to look for evidence (which is in and of itself &quot;the pursuit for a logical series of events that led to X&quot;).<br />
<br />
This is how the transfer of information through spacetime works- where one continuity leaves off (the present), another picks up (knowledge from the future) and a new history unfolds: A(A). Back to the spotlights in the room- each light is a cone of light- the further out it goes, the larger and more faint it becomes. &quot;Walking from one end of the room to the other in the light&quot; means walking from the close brightness of one spotlight to the indifferentiated middle of the room then across, towards the other spotlight. When you get to the other side of the room you look back and see a tiny (by comparison) light on the other end that you know is equally powerful. <br />
<br />
The indifferentiated middle of the room is the B to Y transfer of information. To the neutral observer it's random chaos, but to the person who walked across the room, it was one straight path. Where one light cone leaves off, the other one picks up and there is in-between. As such, logically and over time, information sent through spacetime will always rewrite itself over time to become logical at the expense of the universe around it.</div>
