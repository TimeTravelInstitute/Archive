Who's Really Running the Show?<br />
<br />
 <br />
I have been having a nagging intuition lately that something is not quite right about Barack Obama. I am not suggesting there is something wrong with the man, per se.  Nor am I talking about the crazy, even dangerous, policies coming out of the White House.  No, lately, I have been wondering if Barack Obama is, in fact, the person who is actually functioning as President of the United States.<br />
I mean, there's no doubt that he fills the position of POTUS but is he really the one in command?  The man actually seems lost at times.  He seems to be reacting to ideas about which he does not really have a clue.  He has left the writing of this health care bill to Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives and she, in turn, has farmed the writing out to several fairly radical community action groups.   When questioned about health care, he seems not to know or understand the details and even with his silver-tongue seems unable to demonstrate any leadership on the issue.<br />
With respect to Afghanistan and the rest of our foreign policy, he seems equally lost.  Especially when it comes to dealing with other world leaders.  He makes beautiful speeches but seems to be unable to cut deals which benefit our nation.  He seems to be acting as a pawn of much more clever world leaders.<br />
The more I watch the man, the more I see a person who appears to be the &quot;face&quot; of some other entity or group.  He seems like a &quot;front man&quot;.  And it is becoming clear that his strings are being pulled by someone else.  He does not appear to be the man in command of the ship of state.  At least, he is not in the driver's seat.  <br />
You might recall that people said about Bush that he was a front man for the neo-cons and that it was really Dick Cheney that was running the show.  It turns out that Dick Cheney was not as influential in Bush's second term as many thought but, perhaps it is true that the neo-cons, whoever they may be, were pulling some of Bush's strings.<br />
 <br />
On the other hand, with Obama, it does not appear that there is anyone who is visible to we the people or the media who is pulling the strings.  If they are there, they are not in elected positions as Cheney was.  They are better hidden than that.<br />
We know that he has been and remains surrounded by life-long radicals,  professed communists and anti-capitalists, some of whom he has even appointed as czars in his administration.  Thirty six czars, to date.  But is it Obama who is picking the czars or is it the czars who are running the show and propping up Obama as their front man?  <br />
 <br />
I know all this may  sound crazy but, really, when you look at the man without the idolatry and media worship, does he really look like he knows what he is doing?  Does he seem to have a direction?  Firm convictions?  Something he deeply believes in?  The more he talks  now, the more his words seems empty of content.  Platitudes about America and the American people which, when he says them, simply do not ring true.  They are words being mouthed but not believed by him.<br />
Okay, so maybe he is really clever, is firmly moving the ship to the left while mouthing the words of a centrist but I don't think so.   What I used to think was that he was a really slick conman who was making us watch his left hand while he was manipulating us with his right.  But, now I don't think that so much.  I think the man is more plastic than real.  Now I begin to see him as the &quot;Great and Powerful Oz&quot;:  a fearsome presence who is being manipulated by men behind the curtain.  And while Obama does not have strong convictions, the men behind the curtain do.  And they are moving this country down a dangerous path.  All the while, we are being distracted by Obama and what he says and does.<br />
Okay, maybe I am simply a mildly paranoid conspiracy theorist.  Why, you might ask, have Obama up there?  Why not have one of the actual people behind the curtain run for President.  Well, being a paranoid conspiracy theorist, I can come up with an answer to that question.  Those other people behind the curtain have backgrounds that are so radical that they would never have made it past the first few days of a campaign.  Additionally, they are life-long community organizers and they know what kind of face can be effective if you wish to radically change the nation.  First, you need a black man to gain the support of the vast black minority.  Second, you need a pale skinned black man so as not to be too much of a threat to white Americans.  For the same reasons, you need a mixed race man who allies himself with the poor and down-trodden.  And you need someone who speaks well enough to co-opt the language of the right and appear to be a uniter, not a divider.  Someone who sees, or at least can articulate,  both sides of an issue.  This is the kind of man you would pick to be your front man so that while you move things drastically and dramatically left, the vast majority of Americans will not believe that was the intention of the moderate appearing front man.  <br />
Yes, Obama was a community organizer.  Yes, he could be clever enough to have all this be his idea.  But he really wasn't a community organizer for that long.  And when he was, he didn't do anything truly radical.  It was more a time during which he was being trained than a time when he was driven by a personal sense of commitment to anything in particular.  There are people who are now in his government who have been community organizers and radical left wing activists for 20-30 years.  These people have deeply ingrained commitments to changing the system and have been actively trying to do so for all that time.  Obama is not one of them.   <br />
In my view, Obama has been trained and used as a puppet by others for a long time.  His successes seem to have come too easily, as if they have been orchestrated.  His life appears to have been pre-planned.  I mean, Harvard Law Review without publishing a single paper of note.  That is unusual.  A community organizer for a short time, a State legislator for a few years, a freshman US Senator, a convention key-note speaker, and then POTUS.  How does that happen?  A person with zero governmental administrative experience is running the entire government of the United States .. <br />
How do 1100 page documents get developed and put out in such short order?  Who is writing all these proposals?  Does it not seem that something is just not quite right here?  Forget about the specifics of the policies for the moment.  Have you seen this level of activity in the first few months of any other administration in your lifetime?   Does Obama seem like the kind of person that could manage this level of activity in so short a time?  Too much does not make sense here.  <br />
So, slowly but surely, I am becoming convinced that it is not Barack Obama who is running the show.  The White House has been captured by a group of people who are using Barack Obama as their front man.  He is nothing but an articulate but empty suit.  We have to start looking behind the curtains to find out who is really controlling the &quot;great and powerful Obama&quot;. <br />
 <br />
Something to think about..............<br />

			"articleBody": "The NoBull Newsletter\nWho's Really Running the Show?\n\n \nI have been having a nagging intuition lately that something is not quite right about Barack Obama. I am not suggesting there is something wrong with the man, per se.  Nor am I talking about the crazy, even dangerous, policies coming out of the White House.  No, lately, I have been wondering if Barack Obama is, in fact, the person who is actually functioning as President of the United States.\nI mean, there's no doubt that he fills the position of POTUS but is he really the one in command?  The man actually seems lost at times.  He seems to be reacting to ideas about which he does not really have a clue.  He has left the writing of this health care bill to Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives and she, in turn, has farmed the writing out to several fairly radical community action groups.   When questioned about health care, he seems not to know or understand the details and even with his silver-tongue seems unable to demonstrate any leadership on the issue.\nWith respect to Afghanistan and the rest of our foreign policy, he seems equally lost.  Especially when it comes to dealing with other world leaders.  He makes beautiful speeches but seems to be unable to cut deals which benefit our nation.  He seems to be acting as a pawn of much more clever world leaders.\nThe more I watch the man, the more I see a person who appears to be the \"face\" of some other entity or group.  He seems like a \"front man\".  And it is becoming clear that his strings are being pulled by someone else.  He does not appear to be the man in command of the ship of state.  At least, he is not in the driver's seat.  \nYou might recall that people said about Bush that he was a front man for the neo-cons and that it was really Dick Cheney that was running the show.  It turns out that Dick Cheney was not as influential in Bush's second term as many thought but, perhaps it is true that the neo-cons, whoever they may be, were pulling some of Bush's strings.\n \nOn the other hand, with Obama, it does not appear that there is anyone who is visible to we the people or the media who is pulling the strings.  If they are there, they are not in elected positions as Cheney was.  They are better hidden than that.\nWe know that he has been and remains surrounded by life-long radicals,  professed communists and anti-capitalists, some of whom he has even appointed as czars in his administration.  Thirty six czars, to date.  But is it Obama who is picking the czars or is it the czars who are running the show and propping up Obama as their front man?  \n \nI know all this may  sound crazy but, really, when you look at the man without the idolatry and media worship, does he really look like he knows what he is doing?  Does he seem to have a direction?  Firm convictions?  Something he deeply believes in?  The more he talks  now, the more his words seems empty of content.  Platitudes about America and the American people which, when he says them, simply do not ring true.  They are words being mouthed but not believed by him.\nOkay, so maybe he is really clever, is firmly moving the ship to the left while mouthing the words of a centrist but I don't think so.   What I used to think was that he was a really slick conman who was making us watch his left hand while he was manipulating us with his right.  But, now I don't think that so much.  I think the man is more plastic than real.  Now I begin to see him as the \"Great and Powerful Oz\":  a fearsome presence who is being manipulated by men behind the curtain.  And while Obama does not have strong convictions, the men behind the curtain do.  And they are moving this country down a dangerous path.  All the while, we are being distracted by Obama and what he says and does.\nOkay, maybe I am simply a mildly paranoid conspiracy theorist.  Why, you might ask, have Obama up there?  Why not have one of the actual people behind the curtain run for President.  Well, being a paranoid conspiracy theorist, I can come up with an answer to that question.  Those other people behind the curtain have backgrounds that are so radical that they would never have made it past the first few days of a campaign.  Additionally, they are life-long community organizers and they know what kind of face can be effective if you wish to radically change the nation.  First, you need a black man to gain the support of the vast black minority.  Second, you need a pale skinned black man so as not to be too much of a threat to white Americans.  For the same reasons, you need a mixed race man who allies himself with the poor and down-trodden.  And you need someone who speaks well enough to co-opt the language of the right and appear to be a uniter, not a divider.  Someone who sees, or at least can articulate,  both sides of an issue.  This is the kind of man you would pick to be your front man so that while you move things drastically and dramatically left, the vast majority of Americans will not believe that was the intention of the moderate appearing front man.  \nYes, Obama was a community organizer.  Yes, he could be clever enough to have all this be his idea.  But he really wasn't a community organizer for that long.  And when he was, he didn't do anything truly radical.  It was more a time during which he was being trained than a time when he was driven by a personal sense of commitment to anything in particular.  There are people who are now in his government who have been community organizers and radical left wing activists for 20-30 years.  These people have deeply ingrained commitments to changing the system and have been actively trying to do so for all that time.  Obama is not one of them.   \nIn my view, Obama has been trained and used as a puppet by others for a long time.  His successes seem to have come too easily, as if they have been orchestrated.  His life appears to have been pre-planned.  I mean, Harvard Law Review without publishing a single paper of note.  That is unusual.  A community organizer for a short time, a State legislator for a few years, a freshman US Senator, a convention key-note speaker, and then POTUS.  How does that happen?  A person with zero governmental administrative experience is running the entire government of the United States .. \nHow do 1100 page documents get developed and put out in such short order?  Who is writing all these proposals?  Does it not seem that something is just not quite right here?  Forget about the specifics of the policies for the moment.  Have you seen this level of activity in the first few months of any other administration in your lifetime?   Does Obama seem like the kind of person that could manage this level of activity in so short a time?  Too much does not make sense here.  \nSo, slowly but surely, I am becoming convinced that it is not Barack Obama who is running the show.  The White House has been captured by a group of people who are using Barack Obama as their front man.  He is nothing but an articulate but empty suit.  We have to start looking behind the curtains to find out who is really controlling the \"great and powerful Obama\". \n \nSomething to think about..............\n\nhttp:\/\/www.sodahead.com\/united-states\/subject-no-bullread-with-thought\/blog-184222\/\n\nRMT",
