&lt;&lt;wouldn't we know already, i mean wouldn't someone from the future; where they did discover it have already visited the past..&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Somebody already does knowâ€¦ It's happening as we speak, and ponder of it. It's in our sleep and in our work. <br />
<br />
It's in everything we do, and experience.<br />
<br />
They are manipulating us and orchestrating our lives, for their own selfish gain. <br />
<br />
Yes, Time Travel is very much real. I know this, and soon many will too.<br />
<br />
There is very little freewill, when one is a pawn and knows it. <br />
<br />
You asked if anyone would know if time travel would be real, that a way to prove it would be to visit the past.<br />
<br />
I am assuming you don't yet know about the double digit phenomena?<br />
<br />
Visit my website at: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Atrium/9822/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Atrium/9822/</a> to learn more about the Time Travel threat.<br />
<br />
This is one of many signs of Time Travel being evident in our lives. And perhaps soon, this will be implemented on a larger scale. <br />
<br />
How will others react? Perhaps not in the way the Activist would wish them to. But more to a spiritual side, that would grant them the right to proceed with enslaving humanity.<br />
<br />
More later,<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Hi I'm Cat,<br />
<br />
Perhalf this could help you out.  I posted it under time navigation but I'll repost it again.<br />
<br />
In remembrance of September 11th<br />
<br />
The date of the attack: 9/11   9+1+1=11<br />
September 11th is the 254th day of the year:  2+5+4=11<br />
After September 11th there are 111 days left in the year.<br />
119 is the area code to Iraq/Iran:  1+1+9=11<br />
Twin Towers standing side by side looks like the number 11<br />
The first plane to hit the towers was flight 11<br />
The state of New York was the 11th state added to the union<br />
New York City has 11 letters<br />
Afghanistan:  11 Letters<br />
The Pentagon has 11 letters<br />
Ramzi Yousef:  11 Letters (convicted of orchestrating the attack on the WTC in 1993.<br />
Flight 11 had 92 passangers on board:  9+2=11<br />
Flight 77 had 65 passangers on board:  6+5=11<br />
<br />
All this equals up to TIME MANIPULATION. <br />
<br />
There is even proof of time manipulation in these posts.  If you look back under the post of &quot;Time Navigation&quot; check out post number #93 on January 23rd the time posted was 9:11.  Also check out post #101 on January 25th the time is 8:33 (see the 33 double digits?) <br />
<br />
Maybe the TimeTravelActivist can better explain the theory behind this double digit phenomonon and its verging with time travelers.<br />

<br />
I really hope you don't introduce your self as that to the ladies on the first date <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" />. They may get really turned on, or turned off by that <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
<br />
Any whoâ€¦ as my fellow colleague the Cat just posted and described it for me <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> (bytheway, you're a great friend and a huge help in this battle against the Time Travelers. I appreciate all the help you've given me, thanks <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" />). It's a never-ending bombardment of order that one receives (double digits) that insinuates a demeanor of control in our lives. Separat from our own will to do random acts, there is at the end of them a sign that you came right to the spot you were meant to be.<br />
<br />
As Cat mentioned, the incidents of Sept. 11th, is the evidence supporting this, and cannot be so easily be dismayed. Unlike other conspiracy theories, this one is still very much recent. 4 months, not 20 years later seeing the pattern of something that took place.<br />
<br />
How long was it till the Lincoln/Kennedy connection became known? I don't think it was any time right away.<br />
<br />
We are catching up to the bigger picture of realizing that we are living a real life 'Truman Show.' Things are happening to us in the background, and the Time Travel over seers, hold all the cards. They control us and move us like chess pieces across a vast game board of human illusion. <br />
<br />
We think we are actually winning and accomplishing something. But how does that make you feel when you see your self constantly having to get a vision or an unstoppable urge to look at your watch, and see: 11:11, 2:22, or any other double digit combination?<br />
<br />
The signs are clear and straight to the point. This is not a random world, you're not free to think and do as you wish, (at least not how you think you are). The presence of these numbers, and the events that transpire of them, is basic manipulation and exploitation. Your actions are now being dictated by a force that is implementing it's will upon you (your world), not the other way around. How it should beâ€¦<br />
<br />
Humanity's ideals are a joke to them when you come to this realization. And you are left to believe them regardless, for that is all you know. You will either accept it, or be driven insane by it, your choice. There is often very little compromise, if any you hold on to what you think is the truth of it, and at the same time maintain your guard. Unless your one of those that have given up complete will to it, then there is very little hope for you left. You've voluntary given up your soul to it, without fully understanding what this is your giving it control to. <br />
<br />
You believe in faith, and in oneness. And in all fairness you considerate it divine order. <br />
<br />
Well it is. That's the whole pointâ€¦ That's the reason for Time Travel, the reason for Alien abductions, basically the reason for why a lot of things happen. Wars and accidents too. I.e. Sept. 11th.<br />
<br />
It is to coerce you to reach a forced evolutionary state, where you have no choice, but to change. For the future's sake. <br />
<br />
Now that wouldn't be so bad, if we weren't being forced and control to it (the ends justify the means). Allowing humanity to developed on it's own, without interference from a more advanced society, is the ethical and human thing to do. Not to cheat and play God. <br />
<br />
But then again, I guess July 4th is just another day for some with no real meaning.<br />
<br />
So you may ask, what makes me the expert? What is my compromise? How is it that I know this to be true?<br />
<br />
For years now, I've had to live with this hell. I've seen family members and people close to be become infected with this phenomenon.<br />
<br />
My own experience with them have been nothing short from intense, to say the least. I have been witness and privileged to be in on many spiritual secrets. My own spirituality at the start of this was high, and accepted New Age doctrine very openly.<br />
<br />
The visions and dreams of them were amazing. I would lucid dream often, and see events and people before I met them. I would hear voices and be told instructions of what the next step should be. I would feel as if my body was being fazed out of this reality. I would feel pulls and tugs in my mind, which would place me in a state of displacement with time.<br />
<br />
All that changed of course, when I started to see that everything I did, came to the same conclusion. Got a little ticked off that I wasn't the one calling the shots anymore.<br />
<br />
Then the numbers started. The dreams started to become darker, and more demonic, the world that I once knew was my enemy now. The visions and voices were taunting, and disrespectful. The control I have given it, was my soul, and now I struggle to fight for it back.<br />
<br />
How do I know this is Time Travel? <br />
<br />
I've Time Traveled in my visions and in my dreams. And to come to the point of confirming it i.e. Double Digits. Proves it to me.<br />
<br />
I've defected, I have become an outcast, for following human principles, instead of rolling over at another's spiritual command.<br />
<br />
Now all I dream about, is setting things right again, for the mistakes that I've done to this world. <br />
<br />
I still Time Travel in my visions and dreams, but I am an operative, a rogue, set out to disrupt their agenda.<br />
<br />
As how I am here <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />. Making sure that others realize Time Travel is unethical will ensure that Time Travel and the exploitation of the past is guarded against them.<br />
<br />
I am still very young, I will be 22 years old in April. I plan on making more progress in the coming months explaining this phenomenon in even more clear detail. Updating my website, and reaching more people. Those are my new years resolutions. Resisting against the will of the Time Travelers. <br />
<br />
I must have a strong body, and mind to do it. I work out and keep in shape daily, and practice mind resistance exercises, remembering that I am human, a man, and an individual.<br />
<br />
So far so good: I've managed to reduce the frequency of the double digits in my life. I can grasp onto a controllable reality, where they know I act against them. So naturally the intensity is always being brought up. In all forms, attempting to strike at the heart of my will. By getting to my loved ones who are also going through this. But they know, that this only makes me more determined. And will only strengthen my resolve. As they so love doing with the past. <br />
<br />
But still I fight, and continue my battle. To someday, I will sense that the threat is over, and that I can finally take command of my life, independently, and pursue other Activist roles <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />. I guess I am a natural born Activist, and will always want to fight for what's right. Humanity needs critics like me to watch out for them. Or else, the New Age Cults of the world will take it over and really screw it up, how I know they will.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Hi Manforce,<br />
<br />
Check out the time you posted above its 8:22am. (I bet you didnt even realize it?)<br />
<br />
In regards to TTA.  I believe what he is saying is true!  I dont think he is possessed in any way! I think the only voice he hears is the still voice within! He is a very good listener and observer and has great poriferal insite of whats going on in the world around him!<br />
<br />
Some people are better connected to Global Collective Consciousness than others. Our planet is not a single entity separate from the rest of the universe.  It is a living celestrial body that is connected and dependent on every other living thing in the universe. Some of us can feel this pulling and shifting in our souls. Much in the same way the moons gravitational pull affects our oceans. <br />
<br />
I also continually see these double digits and can feel this silent pulling and shifting and its weight sits on me like a rock.<br />
<br />
It also makes mention of these double digit numbers in the bible when it describes the comming of the antichrist.  That he will bear the number 666. The sixth day in the sixth month in the sixth year.<br />
<br />
The facts are everywhere! You just need to pay more attention.<br />
<br />

 I had to read back to see what you were talking about. seems you have a conversation with tta and cat. Don't let them fool you If you disagree they will revert to name calling. Seems cat is now sounding like some new age guru. Cat, Have you been reading  Solara's web page when we weren't looking. One being and unity seems you have changed your tune. Enough about her.  You see manforce, TTA is causing all of this himself he just hasn't woke up to the fact yet.  He has always had a choice he just chooses poorly and gets himself into all kinds of trouble. He can stop it whenever he likes. He is being   shown his dark side by the very forces he called in. You see you cannot choose the light without first seeing the darkness. The truth will set you free but first it will piss you off. <br />

<br />
It seem more like you're feeling threatened of me that I understand both sides. Or maybe that your surprised to hear that I am more spiritual then you.<br />
<br />
Clara, let me ask you something? Why would you rather have others settle for just spiritual interpretation?<br />
<br />
Settling for just that, is a blind move. And effortless way of allowing them to manipluate you, and put you where they deem is best. Not where you deem it's best.<br />
<br />
Accepting it, saying that it's acceptable to be pissed off by it at first, is not just in it's self wrong, but in human. Is that what you want us all to be Clara, sell outs like you?<br />
<br />
I have proven you to being a hypocrite many times. You haven't posted in over a week, because I exposed you of this again. But now I know, you were lurking and waiting for the right moment to strike back at me. And when I poured my heart to others about my experiences, you see this as the perfect opportunity to avenge your self and discredit me?<br />
<br />
Get this straight Clara, I have been in this forum for a long time; 3 yearsâ€¦ And in that time I have been sincere with my self and others, I have never failed anyone. I have been helping in the fight against Time Travelers and those that would wish to exploit others. What have you been doing? Accepting them? Brining people into your deluded sense of right and wrong?<br />
<br />
You been here for a month? Since you got here I have exposed of as a hypocrite and uncovered your agenda. And it's even clearer now, when you attempt to have others scrub the conversations about Solara?<br />
<br />
I've never said tried to keep anything from people. Obviously you areâ€¦ Why?<br />
<br />
If you wish others to see your point of view, why not point them to the source of the information is of which you speak. Take them to your cult's source, Solara.<br />
<br />
If you feel that I may have called you names, then please look back on my post and bring them to my attention. Because as far as I am concerned, I was just calling you what you are. That's not name calling, that's the truth. If it's not, I challenge you to prove me wrong, and if I am, I will give you my sincerest apologies. <br />
<br />
Further more, allowing this scourge to be allowed to manifest it's self in our lives, how it runs in yours, is only living darker in your corner. Only wanting others to see your side of it, and be kept ignorant of the other. I chose only to inform others and prove to them this is evil. Your New Age doctrines main principle is: &quot;The ends justify the means.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's so easy to prove that. Just look at your last statement.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt; The truth will set you free but first it will piss you off.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Yes, the truth will set you free. But the truth shall never require you to be a slave, and be left ignorant. That's just cult philosophy, if you do.<br />
<br />
-TTA<br />
<br />
P.S. Bytheway, Did you read my quote on my page on Light and Darkness. They are copyrighted, and I know you tend to copy my words from time to time.</div>

<br />
&lt;&lt;Do you think that you are possessed. What do these voices say&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
The voices aren't very frequent with me anymore. A year ago, they were though. Since I'm working and going to school, it doesn't give me enough time to fully recharge my self, and pay attention to them.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Do they make you do anything. maybe you should see a priest. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
No they don't make me do anything, and I'm not Catholic or claim any religion. <br />
The voices I hear, versus a schizophrenic who hears voices, aren't at all wanting to cause harm to me.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;This seems very bizarre. Why doesn't everyone see these numbers&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Bizarre indeed. Just look at the time you postedâ€¦ <br />
<br />
If you want to believe in the New Age interpretation of it, then you will consider it as a time for you to change and &quot;claim your power&quot; ask Clara what the hell that means. <br />
<br />
I asked her hundreds of times, and she's never answered me back <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />. As you can see with my last post to her. Go fig... Some women just hold grudges like that I suppose.<br />
<br />
I guess she doesn't like others disagreeing with her, and questioning her New Age doctrine and Cult at Solara's. She's really showing her true love and compassion for her fellow &quot;brother&quot; as she once called me.<br />
<br />
How easily her heart turned cold, as to forsake me just because I had a difference in opinion. I thought siblings fight all the time Clara?<br />
<br />
Yes, she's really much more spiritually superior then us. Clara and Solara know what's best for us and the world. Let's all be like them, and not give a $hit what happens to people. <br />
<br />
Unlike me, who believes that humanity should live completely free, and be able to govern them selves freely without the future dictating to us what we should do.<br />
<br />
New Age view versus mine, states that there is no other choice, and as you can see, they show it too. (Thanks Clara, for proving my point and for being a great New Age representative of your kind). I say, screw that, there is another choice. If you want true spirituality, you gotta do it ethically. You can't be exploiting people, or allow them to be manipulated. What the hell is that? Saying that things will be uncomfortable for you at first, but its okay, because it's for your own good. That's putting a huge spin on slavery and selling out. <br />
<br />
Alien Abductions, or as Clara likes to call them &quot;our brothers and sisters from the sky&quot; do this to us also in the background &quot;guiding us.&quot; They've done a great monopoly on us as it is... Infiltrating their will in all forms of our main stream society, from spirituality, to acceptance of differences. All of which, are of course, designed intentionally to drive us to them and Clara's perspectives of a being one with the universe. Geesh, What choice will we have if everyone believes this?<br />
<br />
No TimeTravelActivist to teach them of their true agenda? <br />
<br />
Just accept, and allow.<br />
<br />
Clara has stated many times that they are to be allowed to continue guiding us. <br />
Meaning; abducting us. Allowing to be exploited for their own genetic manipulation, and our spiritual gain.<br />
<br />
They want to speed up our human evolution, and our receptiveness to a higher frequency. How a CHIME in the wind blows beautiful sounds. The many wonderful tones and pitches to create a harmony and oneness that will one day be humanity. Is the sole intention for Time Traveling to the past. To perfect the future to allow us to pick up on true essence of creation and love.<br />
<br />
You see, I understand both sides to this. I can speak for both, however I choose humanity. Clara calls this dualityâ€¦ Rather then have me and others succumb to this, I choose to make others aware of such things one will be giving up on if we do.<br />
<br />
I've said many times in my posts, that it will be up to everyone someday to make the decision. I only wish to prepare them by informing them of both sides of this decision. Hopefully also to prevent spiritual brainwashing, that would cause you to forget your roots, and allow them to be changed with out considering the consequences.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Who is doing this I mean you say it is time travelers but are they from our future or a different future. What can you do to stop them. What happens when you see these numbers. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Aliens, Chrononuats from our future in the guise of our angels and spirit guides. They help to work the gears in the background, bringing things in order for us to come to the spot where they think it's best for us.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you something: Are you pretty confident that you know what's best for you? Or do you sometimes need to be helped out and be given advice? <br />
<br />
If your confident and know what your doing, and what's best for you. Wouldn't you want your independence and do things your way?<br />
<br />
Wouldn't you expect all things to being your doing?<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it feel like a taunting feeling, having your life to always seem fixed and be coincidental of everything you do?<br />
<br />
Just look at the time you posted aboveâ€¦ Did you feel you were in control of your thoughts and actions when you posted that? <br />
<br />
You thought you were. But obviously, the time speaks for it's self. You were brought to the point you were meant to be, compliments of the Time Travelers.<br />
<br />
Just look at the Sept. 11th connections with the number 11. <br />
<br />
A seperat-biased consciousness is being applied to our actions. And that is Time Travel, that is manipulation. That is exploitation of an entire race to do what they are, being controlled to do. And that is, follow their will, and only their will. <br />
<br />
Thinking that you had the freewill to do it all on your own, and to come to the conclusion or start of something, and see these numbers only shows you that you didn't. <br />
<br />
Then again, we can follow Clara's message and say, you must of allowed thisâ€¦ Did you Manforce? Did you know it would post at 8:22? <br />
<br />
Are we to say then, that 5,000 people on Sept. 11th chose to die on the same day? <br />
<br />
To be the product of an end result (spiritual gain) that is sanctioned by New Age'rs and considered voluntary? Geesh, talk about the ends justify the means. That's a little extreme. Then again, Clara is pretty extreme her self. <br />
<br />
What's that again Clara, you want to abolish religions and our Army??<br />
<br />
Go ahead, admit it again. Or must I refer people to your post?<br />
<br />
Well if they did allow this to happen to them in their lives to begin with, they sure got them selves in a whole lot of &quot;trouble&quot; ehh Clara?<br />
I was being sarcastic if you didn't pick up on it. <br />
<br />
I know of lots of people who never allowed this, and happens to them anyways (the double digits). I think Clara is just making excuses for it, because it's what she believes with a blind conviction of it's righteous (false) benevolence.<br />
<br />
To only see that having to sacrifice your self to a spiritual life, you have given them the control to do with what they want with you. A human life, a life of passion and physical love, becomes non-existence. Having to rely now on spiritual instinct, you've lost who you once were. <br />
<br />
A race of humans with the rights to morals and principles. Of freedom and choice. Now becomes a race of spiritual humans who wish only to aid in their search for oneness with the universe, at all costs. <br />
<br />
Even if that means having to alter the past to do it. Even if that means having to manipulate and exploit ancient humanity to do it. Even if that means having to sacrifice thousands and millions of innocents to accomplish your goals. <br />
<br />
Just look at the numbers, they don't lie, look at how beautifully it was all orchestrated. Right down to flight numbersâ€¦ this is organized spiritual genocide. And to have no right to find those responsible and bring them to justice, and accept it, is just pathetic. Give me a breakâ€¦ it makes me sad and sick both at the same time.<br />
<br />
If any of you were a New Age'r, would you consider this? Would you think about it as being Time Travel and wrong? If I have not been the TimeTravelActivist for these past 3 years, would the future humanity have become more accepted of altering the past and changing it for the future's benefit?<br />
<br />
I hope that before I leave this world, I would have made a difference. I am only following my moral imperative as a human being and citizen of this world. There is great reason to be concerned, if some would just take the time to consider it.<br />
 <br />
I'd hate for something to happen to me, which will cause me to no longer be the TimeTravelActivist. This world will always need concerned citizens, who are impartial to spirituality but can understand it. This world needs people to criticize these New Age'rs, to ensure they are put in check when the time comes when they will implement their will upon us. Remember, keep technology away from Cults. Nothing good will come out of it. Only Slavery.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
TTA<br />
<br />
P.S. &lt;&lt;Have you found others besides your family who are seeing them.This is so scary. I'm sorry for you I wish I could help. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Yes, I know of a couple of people I met on the Internet who also see these. My good friend, the CAT is one of them. And Clara is anotherâ€¦ But as you can see, there is a disagreement on who's interpretation is accurate, and who's isn't. I'll just say this, they both are. The only difference is, what path is morally right for humanity to take. Which side will do the most good and not force you to sell out? <br />
<br />
Following humanity to the end, will be harder, and not be as spiritual as the latter. But at least you would live completely free and get to explore space and the stars, and be ready for what's out there. Instead of being pacifists and allowing our descendants to becoming more wusses and little Clara's and Solara's.<br />
<br />
Bytheway, Clara, your not Solara her self are you? Just thought about that when I looked at both your names side by side. Very similar. Just change the So. to Cl, and there's your name <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.</div>

Cat<br />
 <br />
I'm starting to hit on double digits (more often) when I wake up at night and check the clock. Some folks might find this sort of coincidence alarming...but hey its's an &gt;alarm&lt; clock right?....teeheehee<br />
<br />
Ok, so it wasn't funny. But why? No, no not &quot;why was it not funny&quot;, why do the doubles show up 'too' often? My theory is that the subconscious always knows both what time it is and what your local clock is going to be reading. Your subconscious wants you (your conscious self) to know it is there. It wants your attention, so it sends you messages by making you wake up and look at the clock during the double number displays.<br />
<br />
Other types of double number synchronisities require different and maybe more complex explainations.</div>

 You are correct it does have something to do with your subconscious. when you get to the point when you relise that you are not in control it teaches you how to gain control. All good lessons are hard. the numbers are only showing you what you are capable of. In order for you to make a more conscious choice. Once you pass certain milestones the numbers change to  something else. It's like a video game you must do certain things in order to move forward. ttta and cat are stuck and they can't seem to see the forest for the trees. The first thing to do is get calm. You can't do anything when your angry. The reason I know they are stuck is because they revert to name calling. That was my first clue as to where there at. Second, they think something is being done to them. They are not victoms they just think they are . I can help them but they refuse to let me. I have been where they are and found the key to unlock that door. Its right in front of them they just can't see it. Shadow, I did not know that you saw the numbers too. What has been your  experience. Do you feel like a victom also.<br />

 Yes I did read your post. Religion and Army. Yes I would like to see both tranformned. Religion controls without education and armys kill human being. When we move forward we will not need either one. We will live in a society based on mutual love and freedom. In my time maybe not. but that is my hope. Some of us are putting that out in our thoughts and we are being shown the way. Some will choose to follow some will not and that is there choice. But like I said in order to get there we must do the work and no we don't do it just for ourselves we do it for the future generations who will live on this planet. We choose in order that they will not have to live with armies and being told they are bad so they need to go to church. religion and spirtuality are two different things. Religion feels the need to control. Spirituality teaches you how to be in control of yourself. There are two energies love and fear you cannot serve both. I do not believe in taking away anyones religion and at this point in our evolution armies are neccessary. But when you evolve to a certain point these things are not needed. some of us are moving to that level and being guided as to where to go but you first must let go of all that fear it doesn't serve you any longer. There is a  plan for earth and it will go forward with or without you . The ship is leaving the dock you better hurry and get your ticket.<br />

Believe me the &quot;numbers&quot; are just the tip of the iceberg. The first I noticed years ago, was 3-9. To me it has always accompanied bad luck, but they have been helpfull to me because it has warned me off from a lot of things that would otherwise have been trouble.<br />
<br />
The numbers are the map and not the territory. People don't understand outside manipulation because they don't know how reality is put together or how it works. I don't know either but figuring it out is my chief hobby. I know enough about it to know that 99.99% of the human race doesn't have a clue. We do have the collective experiance however to stand our ground.<br />
<br />
TTA is a thoughtfull and competent observer. I think he is seeing pieces of the puzzle that the rest of us have overlooked.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">So it's just like that, huh Clara?<br />
<br />
There is no control and manipulation, only misconceptions of the bigger picture<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;They are not victoms they just think they are . I can help them but they refuse to let me.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Clara, you stopped talking to me, rememberâ€¦ <br />
<br />
And help me to what? Become like you? Sell out. For the future's sake.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I have been where they are and found the key to unlock that door&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
The only thing you found Clara is to succumb up to it. You sold out to something that you don't truly know what's it's about.<br />
<br />
Humanity will not know true freedom, until you realize that having them help and guide us, is not allowing us to exercise our independence. Just remember that, next time you see 11:22 straing right in front of you, or any other double digit. Repeat it to your self, and say you came to this point all on your own.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Yes I did read your post&gt;&gt; <br />
<br />
Why were you around the bush, and didn't respond sooner? You said many times you wouldn't read or respond to me. Why make your self seem more like a hypocrite and finally admit that I was right about you all along? I thought you wanted people who go through these double digits to listen to you, so you can convert them?<br />
<br />
Reminds me of a fellow Christian I once knew who preached preached and preached about how he would never cheat on his wife, because it was a sin. But in the end, he was a hypocrite, and was caught with his pants down. My dear friend was devastatedâ€¦ <br />
<br />
Speak the truth, and maintain on the level Clara.<br />
<br />
I may not be New Age and all Gun-Ho on selling out the planet like you Clara, but for the most part, I am more honest and sincere to my self and others. <br />
<br />
I know your reading this, so I expect a responds. If not, then I know you know it's true about you. And that is not name calling. It's the truth. <br />
<br />
Gotta go,<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">TTA and Shawdow,<br />
 I will talk to you but please no name calling or I will not respond. Yes the numbers are hard but in no way as hard as what you will experience in the future without them. I will start by telling you my experience. I am married now for 17 years and have 2 children. The numbers started for me about  5 years ago. My husband has seen them for 14 years.  At the time I was going to church, a methodist church and had been for 10 years. When the numbers started I started hearing woices in church. I would leave every sunday in tears and very upset. The voice told me and I  quote &quot; This is not what I meant&quot; I assumed it was Jesus.<br />
So I quite going to church. It was to much for me to handle. My husband was upset because he liked church and was very involved.<br />
At that point I just didn't care. So I started staying home. The numbers became more numerous and I started looking for answers. One day in my back yard I said to Jesus if you exist you better tell me what the hell is going on or I am going to believe you are dead and buried. I was ready never to set foot in a church again. Well from then on I became telepathic. He would talk to me in my mind and tell me different things . I was very sick at the time so I ask him what was wrong. He led me to that information which is to bizzare to say here. I had to go through emotional healing work to cure myself it was not easy. He told me alot about sickness and why people are so sick and yes he introduced me to our alien brothers and sisters. Then he had to test me so I could claim my power. At first I thought I had met the devil himself but when I came to my senses I realized why he was being so hard on me. My husband and I were fighting about everything. I realized that every time I saw numbers we would fight or somebody would fight about something. I started using the numbers to condition myself to these events. I remember the first time I claimed my power. My family and I  were driving in the car and an argument broke out well I almost jumped right there and yelled myself but a few moments before I had seen the numbers so I knew what was coming. I just started laughing they looked at me like I was crazy. I was so proud of myself .It was my first lesson in self control.think a minute about the events that transpired around Jesus. He  did not loose control but those around him did Thats why he died. He showed them how mad they could get and they ended up killing him. they couldn't face their own demons so they took it out on him . Since then I use the numbers they don't use me. The world is going through a very tough time right now . You will need all the help you can get. It wont be easy for any of us. I have seen the future also but the things I have seen do not involve anyone having to travel through time. Humans are predictable to a certain extent. also there are those that can see from far away. looking down at he earth and know what events will transpire simply because they are out there and we are down here. There are certain things I cannot tell you because it is against universal law. You must learn for yourselves. Everybody is waiting for Jesus to return  The fact is he already has. remember he said he would come like a theif in the nite well thats true. He cannot save you it is against universal law but he can help you to save yourself. I have probably told you to much. But I am desperate to help you because I know what you are going through. My sources told me to tell you  that there are others who are using the number system and they are not good they use it as a signature for there work sort of like serial killers do. They always leave a message in there work. I think the events of 911 is just that, a signature.<br />
I know there are dark forces I have experienced them. The only way to stop them is to learn self control. Use the numbers to learn about yourself and whats going on. The only way dark forces can use you is if you let them. They cannot harm you or anyone else if you learn self control. I know its hard but you can do it. Once you get control the numbers will change in order to help you. They may ask you to move to a safe location. they may ask you to tell someone something Like I am doing now.Believe me I would never hurt anyone but the future depends on us following through. If this earth falls to dark forces it may be hundreds of thousands of years before we get another chance. If you allow yourself to move forward and learn this then maybe I will be given permission to tell you more. If you choose not to I will accept that and move on. It is your choice and I cannot take that from you. I would like to ask you to rethink your position on Jesus he is not a time traveler. He does travel astraly. The meaning is very simple about how he healed. It wasn't done with any devices from the future. the blind will see the dead will rise. It is all so very simple if you knew you would laugh and so ohh! how clever I would have never thought of that. but I cannot reveal that only he is allowed to tell you. Ask him and I bet he will show you. <br />

<br />
&lt;&lt;I will talk to you but please no name calling or I will not respond.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
You mean, do not speak the truth? Nah, I rather speak the truth.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Yes the numbers are hard but in no way as hard as what you will experience in the future without them.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
So far, it sounds like the same old thing Clara, you want us to accept it, and allow them to exploit us.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I will start by telling you my experience. I am married now for 17 years and have 2 children. The numbers started for me about 5 years ago. My husband has seen them for 14 years. At the time I was going to church, a methodist church and had been for 10 years. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Well no wonder you don't like religions, you obviously must have had bad experiences with them, and growing up to I'm sure. Did you have religion shoved down your throat?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt; When the numbers started I started hearing woices in church. I would leave every sunday in tears and very upset. The voice told me and I quote &quot; This is not what I meant&quot; I assumed it was Jesus.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Well when I first heard the voices, it told me this: 'I am the Ancient One, who will come to you in new light to spread in the darkness of your delusions.'<br />
<br />
Visions of Jesus Christ surfaced in me afterwardsâ€¦ <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;So I quite going to church. It was to much for me to handle. My husband was upset because he liked church and was very involved.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear that. You were very aware that something was not right, and didn't accept it, because you knew it instinctly. You sure changed though.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;At that point I just didn't care. So I started staying home. The numbers became more numerous and I started looking for answers. One day in my back yard I said to Jesus if you exist you better tell me what the hell is going on or I am going to believe you are dead and buried.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Yes Yes, we've all gone through that moment. At one point or another most of us ask God the 'you better, or else' question.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I was ready never to set foot in a church again. Well from then on I became telepathic.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Been thereâ€¦ can't wait to hear how you took the turn into New Age doctrine. <br />
<br />
I'm just responding as I read, I'm quite in a hurry right now <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />

&lt;&lt;He would talk to me in my mind and tell me different things . I was very sick at the time so I ask him what was wrong. He led me to that information which is to bizzare to say here.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Ahhhh, I thought you were finally going to level with us?<br />
<br />
Well that's okay, I can tell you what my voices said. At first they started off being very nice and patient. Then I started to wonder about the principles behind certain things it was mentioning to me to do. I then said 'but isn't that wrong' excuses and spins, just like the ones you gave is all I got. It wasn't until I started to go along doing things my own way, that it started to get a little hostile. Just because I wouldn't follow their path of ignorance, and don't ask any smart questions.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I had to go through emotional healing work to cure myself it was not easy. He told me alot about sickness and why people are so sick and yes he introduced me to our alien brothers and sisters.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
He? Who's He? The voice?<br />
<br />
I think I figured out why I didn't turn to your New Age doctrine <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
<br />
I never get sick, I haven't had so much as a sore throat in over 2 years. <br />
<br />
I was never brought down to my knees as to give up and turn to your fellow 'brothers and sisters from the sky' <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />. <br />
<br />
My combination of soul, with this phenomenon sure has developed something different. A breed that is undying and will not rest til justice is served. The TimeTravelActivist emerges out of this a fighter for the people. Not one to talk them into selling out, like some people.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Then he had to test me so I could claim my power.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Oh huh, now your taking spooky stuffâ€¦ 'Claim your power' define what that is for once.<br />
<br />
Bytheway, what did you think about Heaven's Gate and their philosophy? Sounds very similar to what your trying to sell to people here. A life in another world, with your 'brothers and sisters from the sky.'<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;At first I thought I had met the devil himself but when I came to my senses I realized why he was being so hard on me.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Well you know what. When I faced the Devil and his minions (meaning Time Travelers and their lackeys i.e. New Age followers) I pretty much knew who I was facing. My psychic abilities in my dreams probed deep enough to uncover their true agenda.<br />
<br />
Your seems more developed in your mind as faith and acceptance of what's happening to you. Without question any longer, I am sure.<br />
<br />
I have seen Time Travelers. I have had visions of being in the future, and meeting people I would someday meet. And I am pretty sure, CAT has too <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" />.<br />
<br />
This is Time Travel Clara. Just how ancient humanity didn't have the capacity to comprehend that maybe Angels could be future Time Travelers, using technology to make it seem that they were from God. Could very easily buy into people's strong faith and conviction and make them believe it, to get them to do what they wanted them to do.<br />
<br />
Just how what's happening with you.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;My husband and I were fighting about everything. I realized that every time I saw numbers we would fight or somebody would fight about something.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Like I said. Coming to the point of something, and seeing the numbers, indicate that Time Travelers have incurred your Time Line to come to this. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I started using the numbers to condition myself to these events. I remember the first time I claimed my power. My family and I were driving in the car and an argument broke out well I almost jumped right there and yelled myself but a few moments before I had seen the numbers so I knew what was coming. I just started laughing they looked at me like I was crazy.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Sounds more like that was the moment you sold out and gave up. You should have met me before you did. I might have been able to talk sense into you 5 years ago. If it didn't happen to me 3 years ago, though <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I was so proud of myself .It was my first lesson in self control.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
A grown woman, and barely learned self-control. And now you feel you understand this perfectly and are more spiritually superior then us to tell us what this phenomena is? <br />
<br />
Oh come on Clara, listen to your self.<br />
<br />
Try living through a tougher situation then just people arguing all around you. I can see why you still detach your self and don't like people disagreeing with you. You still haven't learned to handle situations like that. You just avoid them.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;think a minute about the events that transpired around Jesus. He did not loose control but those around him did Thats why he died.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
He died, because he knew he was destined to die and be martyred as a Messiah. <br />
<br />
And if Jesus was alive now, I'm pretty sure he would put you in check with this New Age/Acceptance of Evil/TimeTravelers/Manipluation and control of people crap, you keep putting a spin on. This is what it all basically is. Taken off the sugar coating and frosting and the cute little pink bow <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />, you see that under all that hype and goodness you thought it was. Is really just a plot to control people. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;He showed them how mad they could get and they ended up killing him. they couldn't face their own demons so they took it out on him .&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Is that why you got that way too when I exposed you? All this talk about loving everybody, sure changed. To having you call us all uncivilized and unenlightened. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Since then I use the numbers they don't use me.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Right, you just keep telling your self that. I am sure you believe it too.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;The world is going through a very tough time right now . You will need all the help you can get. It wont be easy for any of us.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
This is a tough time; I have to deal with New Age'rs who want others to sanction this someday. I have to work hard and fast to make sure they aren't left ignorant of the consequences. Would you like to help and show others 2 sides to this?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I have seen the future also but the things I have seen do not involve anyone having to travel through time. Humans are predictable to a certain extent. also there are those that can see from far away. looking down at he earth and know what events will transpire simply because they are out there and we are down here.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Your Alien buddies again, huh Clara?<br />
<br />
Well do you really think they would tell you exactly what their hidden agenda is?<br />
<br />
Tell me something people, if you found out tomorrow that there were aliens coming, wouldn't you like to know where they been and what they been doing all this time?<br />
<br />
They will never show them selves to you, because people like me and others will ask to many questions that will expose their whole conspiracy. Completely ruining religions and New Age doctrine, like Solara's. <br />
<br />
Maybe they should be exposed. Then maybe people would see that we really need to be independent, and choose our own path. Not the one they are forcing us to take.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;There are certain things I cannot tell you because it is against universal law. You must learn for yourselves.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Your so full of it Clara. You don't know jackâ€¦ If you did, you would tell us. As I have told everyone the secrets of their plans. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Everybody is waiting for Jesus to return The fact is he already has.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Even the Non-Christians? What about the Muslims, are they waiting for Jesus too? How about the hindu's? No? Then how about the Jehovah Witnesses?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;remember he said he would come like a theif in the nite well thats true. He cannot save you it is against universal law but he can help you to save yourself.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
And let me guess, accepting your New Age God and allowing your little green friends from your Uranus is the only way right? How convenient. <br />
<br />
You make a good New Age spokesperson. I hope you work on commissions, cause I sure ain't buying what your selling <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />. Selling out that is.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I have probably told you to much.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Hold on, wait, I think I know the end to this line <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> 'And now, I gotta kill you.'<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;But I am desperate to help you because I know what you are going through.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Spare me Clara, your only 2 years ahead of me with dealing with this. And others, 10 years or more. You appoint your self as truly knowing better and having the absolute truth to this. But you don't have it. <br />
<br />
The truth is this. You are a human being. You are in theory meant to live freely. You have the right to know what is happening to you, and who's doing it. To know the truth, and ask questions. <br />
<br />
You gave that up along time ago. You stopped asking questions, you already made up your mind that it's ethical for it to happen, and for your own good. And so you assume it's what everybody else going through this wants and will end up to.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;My sources told me to tell you that there are others who are using the number system and they are not good they use it as a signature for there work sort of like serial killers do. They always leave a message in there work. I think the events of 911 is just that, a signature.&gt;&gt; <br />
<br />
Clara, I'm beginning to think that you really have no idea what your talking about. <br />
<br />
Listen, if you also believe that, then how then would your case be explained as being good? How would you tell the difference between the bad ones and the good ones?<br />
<br />
Quit trying to PR and put a spin on everything. It is, what it is. And that is control. <br />
<br />
Bottom line.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I know there are dark forces I have experienced them. The only way to stop them is to learn self control.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
The Dark forces are the numbers. And we have evidence on Sept. 11th to prove it. They orchestrated this, and so it took place. Your then going to believe what ever your sources tell you, and say that it was the bad tribe of number inflicting creatures that are responsible. Oh pleaseâ€¦<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Use the numbers to learn about yourself and whats going on.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Why not just say what you're wanting to say? <br />
<br />
Tell the people to accept it? Come on, that's basically what your saying anyways.<br />
<br />
Accept being exploited. <br />
<br />
Accept being USED!<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;The only way dark forces can use you is if you let them.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Look, 5,000 were caught in the cross fire of these Time Travelers web. I am very certain that not all 5,000 chose the dark forces, which you speak. <br />
<br />
Do you have any idea what your even talking about?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;They cannot harm you or anyone else if you learn self control. I know its hard but you can do it. Once you get control the numbers will change in order to help you.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Yeah, help change the world to what they deem fit.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;They may ask you to move to a safe location. they may ask you to tell someone something Like I am doing now.Believe me I would never hurt anyone but the future depends on us following through.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
So your voices are asking you nicely? How convenientâ€¦<br />
<br />
They must know then, that you are speaking to the TimeTravelActivist, and are fearing being exposed. So of course they are being nice to you.<br />
<br />
How else would you feel being put on the spot, for millions of crimes that are staked against you? <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;If this earth falls to dark forces it may be hundreds of thousands of years before we get another chance.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
So that justifies it then? It's the end justifies the means approach huh?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;If you allow yourself to move forward and learn this then maybe I will be given permission to tell you more.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
So your claiming to have all the answers to our survival? <br />
<br />
Permission? So whatcha going to do, get down on your knees, put your hands together and say 'Please Master, tell me more, I think they are ready?'<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;If you choose not to I will accept that and move on. It is your choice and I cannot take that from you.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Though since you got here, you've been wanting to give us no choice, but to follow yours. And leave principles and humanity behind.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I would like to ask you to rethink your position on Jesus he is not a time traveler.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Clara, what exactly do you know about Time Travel?<br />
<br />
I am assuming not a thingâ€¦ Why don't we do this? Follow your own advice, and rethink your position in this world with rationality and common sense. Then reconsider all of this, and see what the calculations in your head add up to.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;He does travel astraly. The meaning is very simple about how he healed. It wasn't done with any devices from the future. the blind will see the dead will rise. It is all so very simple if you knew you would laugh and so ohh! how clever I would have never thought of that. but I cannot reveal that only he is allowed to tell you. Ask him and I bet he will show you.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Look, I won't resort to having to exploit what I know of my visions of Christ to make the case that he is a Time Traveler. But I will say this. Spend some time here thinking about Time Travel, and hearing others theories on it. Spend some time considering humanity's principles. And finally spend some time seeing how this all implicates freewill. Then maybe you'll sing a different tune, and realize what you were willing to have done to this world.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Look Clara, the only reason why your upset right now, is because people won't follow your interpretation of the numbers. Excuse me, but you didn't exactly win me over with your story.<br />
<br />
If that's what you believe to be true for your case, then go on believing it. Just don't expect everyone else to.<br />
<br />
Humanity will chose the path that is best, and hopefully not one where we will choose to be left ignorant.<br />
<br />
The only think you hate, is others questioning you. But it has to be done, or else we just accept and become like you.<br />
<br />
Just like the time you were in the car, and gave up 'claimed you power' you had it. You lost it, and laughed out of insanity, that you just couldn't take it anymore. <br />
<br />
You should have asked the questions that I asked: 'Is this ethical'? 'Does this justify it?' 'But what having people choose, and free-will?'<br />
<br />
Then you might have been able to come to this point knowing alittle bit more about who your dealing with, then what Solara brainwashed you to believe.<br />
<br />
'You will never stop us' is one of the few things it's said to me. Well I can sure well try <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
&lt;&lt;You are merely a man who does not wish to spend time learning anything.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Are you sure you are not the one guilty of that?<br />
<br />
Clara, a word of advice. Spend some time taking some Martial Arts Classes, I think it could help you. I don't think you truly comprehend what it means to be human anymore. To feel the surge of adrenaline and raw primal human instinct pump through your veins . Doing a little physical battle, is what you might need to understand what humanity really needs. And understand good and evil, and discipline your mind to not get so upset all the time when someone argues. <br />
<br />
Take Care,<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Clara, <br />
<br />
I have an interesting scenario to explain to you concerning seeing the double digits. Before you look up in faith to these numbers consider this.<br />
<br />
At work I have 2 different clocks that I look at.  One is on my computer as a screen saver and the other is on the telephone LED screen.<br />
<br />
I keep seeing the double digits constantly!!! Day after day!!! So I decided to fix the double crossing time traveling menaces!!!  I changed the clocks (18 minutes apart) so that they would not read the same exact time!  In doing so this is what happened.<br />
<br />
I would look at one clock and it would read 2:24pm and the other would read 2:42pm or 3:13pm on one clock and on the other 3:31pm or 4:35pm on one clock and on the other 4:53pm<br />
This went on throughout the whole day!<br />
<br />
They know I know its them!  Its just their way of playing a cat and mouse hide and seek game with me! They are trying to teach me that no matter how I attempt to deter them by altering the time they still have ultimate control!<br />
<br />
CONTROL WITH NO FREE WILL!!!<br />
<br />
CAT...</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">I am not trying to win anyone, whats to win anyway. I only ask shadow what he thought. Are we all to go to you TTA   before we speak or ask anyone a question. I have never met such a tyrant. You keep talking about free will then why don't you let others use theirs without you  having to critizize people. Shadow doesn't have to answer me that is his free will. You say you are trying to save people, from what? there is hardly anyone talking on this stream. Yes I guess we need you to save us from the evil monster lurking in space. From the boogie man in the closet or maybe from little green men. You who are so wise and clever and us poor little humans who can't think for ourselves need you to tell us what to do. Like I said this is a free world and I can say anything I want and yes you can say what you want to. go right ahead. I'm sure you will need to vent your anger towards me because you don't know what else to do with it. I am beginning to reaslize that that is your issue. You are mad at the world and everyone in it that doesn't agree with you. Thats such a horrible place to be. Well you will never win because we do have free will and I can listen to space people and little green men all I want and you can't do a damn thing about it.<br />
Just because your stuck in the numbers game doesn't mean everybody else is. Some of us are moving forward and we don't need you to tell us were making a mistake. So Shadow do as you please I am not trying to win you to anything. You know who you are.<br />

You said above &lt;there is hardly anyone talking on this stream.&gt;<br />
<br />
Thats because they are sitting back and reading all the facts!<br />
There is not anything more to say...<br />
<br />
Clara, I believe in G*D and I believe he is showing me the sceam of all things and the truth about what life is really all about.<br />
<br />
What &quot;facts&quot; have you supplied to plead your case that we really have free will?<br />
<br />
One cannot take a single step toward heaven without first grasping the universe and all its &quot;numerous&quot; parts. Its like walking into a library where the walls are covered to the ceilings with books in many different languages and subjects.  Its obvious to see that someone must have written all these books.  Maybe we dont understand the other languages in which they are written  But one can see a difinite plan in the arrangements of the books.  A mysterious order which one cannot comprehend but only dimly suspects. <br />
<br />
Clara, does this order suggest free will?<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">It depends how you look at it. Is  bin Laden using his free will? When you exercice your free will you  may just be hurting someone else or stopping them from using theirs. All things are allowed but in order to move from this reality you must learn to see differently. Unless people are taught how to use their free will for the benefit of all mankind then there will be more people like Bin Laden . The numbers gave me freedom because before I had no control now  I do. I know this is true because once I claimed my power I was not swayed by any ill wind that just so happened to blow  my way. We must learn to control ourselves not others. The numbers will change for you when you pass this milestone. but only if you want to. nobody is forcing you. Also which God do you talk to. I would be very careful who you call God they just may answer. also why don't you call your God and tell him to take the numbers away does he  not have the power to protect you from such. The numbers for me are from my friends who have claimed God status not to impose control but to help me learn how to live in a world that is mostly inhabited by darkness. It is my light that I may see. but what I see is my own behavior towards my fellow man . I can only change the world when I change myself. the free will part is that you may choose dark or light. It is your choice. but in order to see the light you must experience darkness. What doen't kill you only makes you stronger. My advice would be to start using the numbers to learn about yourself then everything will change for you . The numbers will transform and you will move on to the next adventure. But if this is not what you want it is your choice. Also how do you know that the god you pray to hasn't sent you these number  because you ask to be helped. Maybe its his or her way of moving you forward. Do you  think children like he lessons their teachers give them everyday, no I think not, but in the long run are students better in the future for having been taught by their teachers. You can learn this I am sure because I did and no you will not lose your free will. You seem to be so afraid of losing how do you know you will not gain if you never take the challenge. TTA thinks I am brainwashed and you may to but to me  I was a slave to myself and now   I have been freed. Here is a little message my friends told me to give you<br />
     There is a place where prisoners are kept in  solitary confinment. Sometimes the prisoners just show up missing.<br />
the prison Guards are puzzled as to how this is happening. They are so sure they have locked everyone in and there should be no means of escape but every now and then one is gone. But you see during the nite when the guards are asleep the shining ones walk through the walls and lead the prisoners to safety. occasionally prisoners become so afraid that they refuse to go with the shining ones they scream and holler because they are afraid it is a trick. The shining ones can do nothing to help them and must leave them in their confinement. It is very sad for the shining ones because they wish to free all such creatures from darkness. Well Suddenly a lot of prisoners were coming up missing. There were stories about these shining ones and the guards became concerned. They couldn't let all the prisoners escape because you see the guard knew nothing else but being guards. What on earth would they do with themselves. So the guards devised a plan. They would tell all the prisoner that the shining ones were evil and they would take them over the hill and eat them alive. They even told them that they had found the prisoners bones over the hill. The guards told the prisoners you must stay here where you are safe.  Well after that not many prisoners were rescued they were to afraid they would be eaten.This went on for many years and many died. The guards were happy that no one was coming up missing and their job was secure. The shining ones were sad so they divised a plan. They sent one of their own into the prison, which was very easy all he had to do was steal a loaf of bread. During the nite he would walk between  the walls and tell all the prisoners that they were being tricked that he had seen where  the shining ones  took them and it was a good place. Many prisoners believed and went with the shining ones but still many did not. to this day the prison still exist and the shining ones still do their nitely rescue. The only hope is that one day the guards will find something else to do with their time and decide to close the prison once and for all. Then the shining ones will be able to return to their own families knowing that no more prisoners need to be rescued.<br />
                                <br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Clara, sorry but it's not like that, I'm sorry you see it that way. I'm kinda in a hurry this Saturday, I have to get a few things done, before it gets to late. So I will not respond to your entire postâ€¦ just yet.<br />
<br />
But I will this one:<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I am not trying to win anyone, whats to win anyway.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
To win others to your 1 way cause. That's what's to win.<br />
<br />
And as I read in your second post, that's exactly what your trying to do.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I only ask shadow what he thought. Are we all to go to you TTA before we speak or ask anyone a question.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Again, you assume wrong about me. I only wish to have others listen to a 2 sided view of this. If I would to just allow your perspective to go unquestioned that would make you very happy and give only people 1 way of looking at it. And that is not the way to go about making decisions.<br />
<br />
As you can see how New Agers are so fanatical and will defend their alien masters to exploit us. You only see what you want to see. What's most convenient for your cause? Not the whole truth behind the agenda.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I have never met such a tyrant.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
That's critic. You avoid all disagreement, so you never really learned the term to call someone who doesn't agree with you. It's called a critic.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;You keep talking about free will then why don't you let others use theirs without you having to critizize people. Shadow doesn't have to answer me that is his free will.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
I can say the same to you. I wouldn't have to criticize you if you gave them more then 1 way of looking at it. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;You say you are trying to save people, from what? there is hardly anyone talking on this stream. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Just because no body is posting, that doesn't mean some aren't listening and reading. Some may be &quot;hmmm, which side sounds good for me to join.&quot; And that means all the difference in the world what someday people may sanction.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Yes I guess we need you to save us from the evil monster lurking in space. From the boogie man in the closet or maybe from little green men. You who are so wise and clever and us poor little humans who can't think for ourselves need you to tell us what to do. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Versus someone else who would rather have us accept this, and give up all human control to it, to something not yet fully comprehended. I feel that I understand what were up against, and am the best candidate to thus far to be the Activist against them. Someone has to speak on behalf of humanity, instead of wanting to sell it out.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Like I said this is a free world and I can say anything I want and yes you can say what you want to. go right ahead.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Thank you, I will. No need to throw a tantrum <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I'm sure you will need to vent your anger towards me because you don't know what else to do with it.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
OKâ€¦<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I am beginning to reaslize that that is your issue.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
You should be a fortune tellerâ€¦ your as phony as Miss Cleo and her and New Jersey/I mean Jamaican accent.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;You are mad at the world and everyone in it that doesn't agree with you.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
I am mad at the world if they become like you and #$*&amp; it up.<br />
<br />
How many more times must I make my case to you Clara for you to understand it. I want everyone, meaning everyone, to live free. Not for one group to come out of the ground and enslave it, and cause all of our principles of freedom and independence to go to hell.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Thats such a horrible place to be.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Tell me about it. I seen what you people can do.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Well you will never win because we do have free will and I can listen to space people and little green men all I want and you can't do a damn thing about it.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Your cockiness will be your un-doing. Don't under estimate humanity. You still have a lot to learn Clara. And your proud attitude is keeping you from listening to someone who isn't a part of your New Age sect.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Just because your stuck in the numbers game doesn't mean everybody else is.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Well it just so happens I only had the double digits 1 time this week. I am devising trail and error techniques against them. Understanding universal principles in my mind, I am learning how to resist and defend what little remains of my patience against them... Taking my self out of synch with them, and creating reality against them, they not very pleased about that, I can feel that. I have learned to resist them (to an extent) and will continue to defy them. <br />
<br />
I am the TimeTravelActivist, that is who I am. Humanities freedom fighter, Time Police and dedicated friend. I will never sell out my friendsâ€¦ NEVER!<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Some of us are moving forward and we don't need you to tell us were making a mistake.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
So you admit it then, you are making a mistake? Why drive everyone to it too? Me or any other activist (critic) telling everyone the truth behind this will save lives, and bring them to understanding. Moving forward, but at a cost of human freewill. You New Agers always leave that out of the brochures, why not tell them the way it is. And see if they still come willingly.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
TTA</div>

<br />
You are treating the number phenomna as if it were messages being sent. Maybe they are messages maybe they are not messages.<br />
<br />
A message implies a conscious SENDER. Too, it is the interpritation of the recieved data that determins what message is recieved. In other words it is the reciever who realizes &gt;A&lt; message content, and he must then guess at the motives of the sender. Wrong! You've just fallen into the same trap again because by trying to decern motive you have accepted the premise that there is a sender at all. It is possible that the number coincidences are dormant inanimate structures imbedded in the structure of time itself. How you choose to interpret, ignore or act on them is a choise you must make on your own, in real time.<br />
<br />
The numbers just turn out to be segments of synchronisity that you happen to notice. The question becomes &quot;how should one chose to deal with the phenomena of synchronisity in their lives&quot;?<br />
<br />
Is synchronisity working for us or against us? I have definitly seen it go BOTH ways. I believe that the psychicly gifted and the psychicly cursed will have opposite experiances in this reguard. The less informed just call it luck. If they are observent and build their own good karma they will do just as well as the rest of us.<br />
<br />
This does NOT mean that there are not malevolent miscreants and and angels in the psychic-spiritual-time realm screwing around with our best and worst efforts. It just means that one should be warry of &quot;gittin their ass bit off.&quot; Self rightous bickering ain't gonna help anything.</div>

<br />
today I went to see the movie The Mothman Prophecies.  ITS BASED ON TRUE EVENTS!!!  I REPEAT TRUE EVENTS!!! <br />
<br />
Numbers and dates and their relationship to worldly disasters play a strong message in this movie! It also gives a strong perspective of other unseen entities and their control over us.  The movie confirmed what I already knew.<br />
<br />
Throughout the whole movie I had chills on the back of my neck!  because coinciently everything that we have been discussing in this forum is linked to the movie!  My interpretation of the MOTHMAN is the angel of death. He is a manipulator and time traveler!<br />
<br />
This is a &quot;must see&quot; for you Clara!!!<br />
<br />
Clara am I suposed to have some insite on that message a friend gave you for me?  Because I dont have a clue how it relates to me? <br />

 Yes I agree with you shadow maybe it is in our DNA and our thoughts trigger the process. I have noticed that when I have positive thoughts the numbers become more positive. Negative thoughts and the numbers tend to show me trouble. Could it be that our thoughts create our reality. Also seeing the numbers could be a blessing. Do you think Bin laden sees numbers and if he did would it have given him a chance to change what he did. Well of course he must have been having negative thoughts Right, <br />
and he did not want to change what he did because in his mind what he did was right. so that being the fact can we still depend on what we think is right and wrong. seems that just doesn't work anymore. so the numbers give us a chance to move beyond right and wrong which brings us back to choice. I think the trick is not to get in the negative or positive but to balance the two. Black and white mixed together makes GREY do they not. When you make choices based in grey there is no duality. let me give you and example of this. If I get into an argument with someone in the past I thought that someone had to win, well usually nobody wins. So instead of fighting and giving away all that energy. I just make the    choice not to go there. I let the other person say what they want and just move on. since I have been on this post TTA has given me a lot of practice. He does want to fight with me but I love him and know that neither one of us will win because its a no win situation. But TTA I still value your opinion and will read what you have to say as long as it doesn't become a battle between us because I need my energy for living not fighting. So by all means state your opinion and let me state mine.<br />
Thank you TTA for given me the chance to grow. angels are light and demons are dark but when you mix  the two you get GREY.</div>

 <br />
you must make your own interpretation. It is for you to ponder. <br />
but only if you choose to. I am going to see that movie you <br />
mentioned it looks pretty cool. I Will let you know what I think. besides the numbers what other coincidences have you had. I will tell you one: several years ago when I was seeing the numbers I had a bizarre experience losing my purse. I went to the movies and left my purse in the seat. I got it back but all the money was stolen. a couple of weeks later I left it on the back of my car and drove off. When I did it flew in this parking lot of a second hand store. I got home and was so mad my husband was even madder because  I had credit cards and some money in it. Well I was seeing numbers at the time and keep telling my husband that something was strange. At that point I did not beleive it was just random. The next day this nice man called and said he found my purse. He actually brought it to my house. I gave him a $20.00 reward he was so nice. Then about a month later my husband and I were on a trip and I left my purse in a large candy shop. We left and got an hour from that shop before I realized my purse was gone. My husband was so mad at me he thought I was losing it (ha,ha) no pun intended. Well we drove all the way back to get it. When I got there The people in the store told me that a man had found it that lived in gulf shores<br />
I lived in pensacola florida at the time, I guess you all know about the ufo sighting there.Yes I lived in gulf Breeze when all that was going on. I have talked to the guy who wrote gulf breeze sighting, but thats another story. We decided to go back home and forget about the trip. I went home and waited, by this time I knew that I was not making me loose my purse something was trying to tell me something. When I got home that nite a man called and said he had may purse. WE drove to gulf shores to pick it up. He was very nice and I was glad to have it back for the 3rd time. Well I know something was up so I figured if  what ever it was could make me loose my purse then they could also talk to me so I said Go ahead tell me whats up. This was the answer: The three people who had my purse represented the 3 types of people on the earth the first one stole my money, the second one went out of his way to help me and bring it back, the third one gave it back to me but didn't go out of his way to help. Then there was a second message it said lose it you'll get it back. I knew that meant my house. That was hard because I had a nice house with a swimming pool. But I knew I had to move because I felt like I was in danger somehow living in florida. Thats why I lost my purse you see, lose it you'll get it back. Lose this lifestyle this house and go where we tell you and you will be fine and get it back. I did and now I live somewhere else and I'm fine and don't have that feeling anymore of being in danger. I have another nice house and have meet the nicest people in the world. so maybe in the future I will know why I wasn't safe in florida. Will I thank the numbers and losing my purse, you bet.  I know they made it happen 3 times in order to get my attention, 3's a charm. So when something bad happens don't look at it as just them driving you crazy they are probably trying to tell you something you just have to be smart enough to figure out the message. The trick is stay calm You can't get the message if you get all upset. My husband went crazy , losing your purse is a serious thing I knew something was up and I needed to listen. Maybe it was angels or alien or my friends from space or maybe I'm phychic and was feeling uneasy because subconsciously I knew I was in danger Maybe my subconscious was sending me a message who knows.<br />
I just know now I'm glad I left. Florida has dangerous energy.<br />
I hope you guys don't live in Florida.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Wow, you guys are good, I think u should write a book or something. Well, back to the topic, like my name says I am a tt, do you believe me? Probably not. Things are not to believe, they are to understand. There are a lot of poofs that time travel exists (archaeological for example), but there's this gap between people conciousness and facts. And about free will, the only thing that gives you freedom is your overall consciousness and most people on earth dont even know their own ignorance (that's true lack), you're being controlled by everything that's above your perception. cya <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /></div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">Its funny you should say above your perception. I was just thinking of that today. suppose this, what if something entered your room and you couldn't see it with your eyes. Say it was telepathic and you were telepathic too   you just didn't know it. Could it not tell you something and you would think it was your own thoughts. So what if this thing were bad and told you  to do something. YOu would actually think that you were thinking this right. Well maybe the numbers are trying to warn you that something is in your range that you cannot see . How can you fight something if you cannot see it. You would need some system that is in your perception to warn you of this intruder. With all the beings out of their bodies how do we know who is invading your space. Take this for example. Jeffery Daumer the killer said he heard voices right. They said he had mental problems. Maybe he was telepathic and really was hearing something talk to him. poor guy and nobody could help him.Have you read stephen Kings book called dreamcatcher it is kinda like this. When I first got into all this stuff. I meet this man who said he was a healer. Well he wasn't but he was interested in out of body travel. He ask me on several occasion if I had seen him at my house out of his body. the fact was yes I was seeing him in my dreams. Now I don't think I was dreaming. I started not liking this man but he would pop into my thoughts just out of the blue. I  started having sexual thought of this man and that  scared me because he was very unattractive and I'm married anyway. I started feeling his presence more and more frequently.  I became very annoyed and when I saw him he would ask me about being out of his body. The only thing I could do to stop him was to put up a mental gaurd. Every time I would feel his presence I would mentally put an X  over his face. I also sheilded  all the opening in my house by mentally projecting a barrier he could not cross. After just a week he started to fade. From then on every time he would ask me if I had seen him I would tell him no. It worked and now he is completely gone from my presence. This is called phycic defense. It can be very useful in the presence of something you cannot see. Maybe all these people who are doing all these random killings are really being controlled they just don't know it. Get this the day I meet the man that I spoke of I saw numbers also when I found his card in a chiropractic office because he was advertising himself as a healer I saw numbers. But the expeience taught me a lesson and led me to learn phycic defense so it wasn't all bad.<br />
Sorry about the spelling I probably need to learn that too. If more people were aware of this maybe we wouldn't have so much mayhem going on down here. I do know that American indians use lots of devices for phychic defense and I recently had a friend make me a dreamcatcher. But be careful don't buy one unless you know the person that made it is pure at heart. I do beleive some Indians put curses on them and then sell them to white people. I know you think I'm crazy. Well I thought people were crazy to until I had my own experiences. sorry I got off the subject we were suppose to be talking about time travel.<br />

<br />
'What's to win over' you askedâ€¦?<br />
<br />
Is it not clear to you yet?<br />
<br />
How many followers do you think your New Age (Esoteric Christianity) site has?<br />
<br />
How many do you think you converted here, since a month ago?<br />
<br />
Now picture this: Multiply that number x100,000<br />
<br />
Now what do you get?<br />
<br />
You get thousands, perhaps millions of New Age followers, who will rather devastate the past and allow to be exploited by aliens. <br />
<br />
That's what to win over. And that is, what my mission is to stop. The way you people live your life and expect everyone else to, and misinterpret the New Testament is a crime against humanity.<br />
<br />
This is not a game Clara, this is serious. Thousands of lives are awaiting for answers, and your not giving them a 2 sided view to choose. Your prying on their fascination with Spiritualism, and are selling them out to a future where Time is used for Spiritual growth. <br />
<br />
Completely forgetting that it's wrong, and that it's exploiting humanity to do it.<br />
<br />
You take a human imagination, you take a person soul, and twist it and make it buy into this wonderful life, that your making them picture. But why don't you tell them that they have to give up their control to your Alien Masters. <br />
<br />
People, have you learned nothing about the Heaven's Gate Cult?<br />
<br />
Their New Age ideas are no different then Clara's and Solara's. <br />
<br />
They want a new life in a new world for everyone. Are you going to be willing to sacrifice your children to it, and make them grow up in a Earth where 1 sided views counter reason and human principles?<br />
<br />
As if this Nation isn't sissy enough, making compromises for every little group out there.<br />
<br />
Cults grow, and intent to shape this nation as their own. Their fanatical followers are scattered everywhere in our society, especially on the internet: In news forums (i.e. Clara), in other places of worship sites, in politics sites. Disseminating their 1 sided view and gaining supporters. Completely being biased towards anyone who does not see them as the 1 true faith, and path to God.<br />
Clara, your such an open person to all this New Age munbo jumbo stuff, just because you feel it's the way to be. You believe everything you hear and read. Your so into speculation, not into facts and reason, or critical thinking.<br />
<br />
That's what will be our downfallâ€¦ For if everyone becomes like you, and accept this, the TimeTravelActivist will be unable to stop the chain reaction you people have done.<br />
<br />
Trying to educate a mass of people who want this doctrine and fantasize about it as the gospel truth, well there is very little reaching them. <br />
<br />
And sometimes, it's better to just give up and let them have the world. Allow them to make the mistake and take innocents along with them. Then maybe, someday the tables will turn, and understand what the TimeTravelActivist tried to tell them centuries before this happened.<br />
<br />
More later,<br />
<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Though TTA and I have disagreed on certain issues in the past few days, I am going to agree with him on this one.<br />
<br />
Since the beginning of the modern christian age, to me, the religion takes on a cult-like appearence.<br />
<br />
This can not be expressed stronger than with the recent rise of new-age, end-of-times christian wackos.<br />
<br />
The most disturbing thing to me is the fact that they use the most touchy issue of human life (death, life-after etc.) and exploit our &quot;fear&quot; of it.  They tell us, Join the cult little children (confess, accept Jesus) or, God will damn you to hell (but he still loves you).  Who can say no to that?  A lot of death row inmates can't.  I've noticed a lot of re-birth among those, being shown on the news.<br />
<br />
Christianity, and most religion has taken on a new form for me, and I offer this simple analogy to show the evolution of religion, and how it has become obsolete.<br />
<br />
A man, in the year X is working on a problem, he knows it will take a long time, but he must work on it.  But one morning, a mystery man comes to his door and tells him, &quot;I know the answer, it may not be right, it may be, do you accept it?&quot;  The man thinks, and realizes he can take the shortcut, preach it to the masses, and no one will know the difference, now he can retire to the bahamas.<br />
<br />
With our scientific discovery, religion has basically been disproven, we think we know where the universe came from.  We know we were created through the process of evolution.<br />
<br />
In the days when religion was created, the earth was the center of the universe, the earth was flat, we were the only thing in the universe, which we did not know existed.  And finally when we started to realize these facts, the Roman Catholic church outlawed such practices, because they knew the truth would hurt.<br />
<br />
Knowing this truth, how can we believe in religion anymore?  We can believe in it, because the cult leaders tell us to.  Scientific knowledge is now religion, because it gives us the true answer, the thoughtful answer, and not the quick way out.<br />
<br />
So I'm not hopping on the bandwagon, maybe I'll go to hell.<br />
<br />
If you believe in something, does it truly exist?<br />
<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">I am not a christian and the fact is hell does not exist for me. I live in the Now. no one thing or person has  the right to send me anywhere . Hell was invented by the church to scare you into submission. also I do not know any new agers who beleive in hell either. I have read no new age material that would  hold this view. The fact is I don't think you even know what new age is all about your just blowing smoke about something you ain't got a clue about. You go live it and learn it then you can come back here and inform everyone about your experience. You sound like the church when they told Galileo the world was flat. <br />

The boogie man lives on hate and fear. Don't provide any.<br />
<br />
And finally 'the ice man' as I call him/it, CAN woop-ya-butt. So don't cut the spooks any slack.</div>

I will not let dark forces push me into a confrontation with anyone. Live and let Live. The dark force is the one who makes us think we are here to save the world. Its the mind set of you against me. They have been using this mehtod for eaons. There motto is divide and conquer and as long as they keep people fighting they can do what they want without your knowledge. Don't fight, don't argue, don't take sides and we'll vanquish them once and for all.  oh ya  whos the ice man?<br />

How convenient for you, that the very human spirit that you wish to sell out, is the dark force among all our problems. And your New Age can do no wrong, for it is the Good force behind everything we do. <br />
<br />
Yeah, you guys go by this quote: 'The ends justify the means'<br />
<br />
By whatever means, you will good or bad, to create an end result you could be proud of. <br />
<br />
That's sadisticâ€¦ And you call us the dark force?<br />
<br />
Humanity simply needs to be independent hold on to it's principles, and understand the forces that are causing to interfere with our lives, not succumb to them. <br />
<br />
Give me a break Clara, you'd say anything to score points to your side. But can you prove any of it?<br />
<br />
I, Cat and maybe a few other Activist, can show that humanity is clearly being controlled and manipulated, and we need to investigate and get a clear understanding of it. Not settle for New Age interpretation, that only dictates you to be ignorant of the truth. <br />
<br />
And having someone do a lot of PR defending their Alien Master and those doing the controlling, that all kinda suspicious in it's self <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />

Could be, I wouldn't be surprised that human existence is just one huge, cleverly established 'Truman show' where the Aliens have created us in their image and have been pulling the strings the whole time.<br />
<br />
But when do you cut the umbilical cord though? <br />
<br />
Would America still be the country it is today, if we didn't sever our British Crown association long ago?<br />
<br />
We may have originated from different places, and or been assisted and brought up by other governments and religions of whence we came... But it comes the time in a race('s) history, when we are ready to fly and be on our own. <br />
<br />
To be truly free and independent. <br />
<br />
After all, is that not the principle by which all men are considered to be governed?<br />
<br />
Yet there is proof indicating that we are notâ€¦<br />
<br />
What humanity should strive to become as a whole, is independent and strong, diplomatic, yet firm. And most of all, ethical and rational. Not be New Age sissy's and go crying to our mommies and daddies, whenever someone disagrees with us. <br />
 <br />
Just like in Jurassic Park, the Dinosaurs fought back. For it is in their instinct to want to survive, as in all living things. Not surrender and allow to be manipulated.<br />
<br />
That's just wrong, doesn't anyone else think soâ€¦<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Yes TTA,<br />
<br />
In the movie Jurasic park they called it &quot;natures selective choice&quot; to do away with the dinosours.<br />
<br />
Once again in history I think Time Travelers mettled with the prehistoric era causing a cataclysmic change in the enviornment to make way for the advancement of the human race.<br />
<br />
Yes the dinosours were manipulated much in the same way we are today by these time travelers.<br />
<br />
By the way TTA thank you for that post of kind words! I think your character has been defined  and revealed here by your commitment to the post.  The choices that you make and the promises you keep hold strongly to your principles!  You refuse to follow the currents of convenience and other influences! What you say defines who you are.  You are a LEADER in your true intents with a great devotion to a worthy cause! At large you triumph! At worst you fail while daring greatly so that humanitys place will never be with those cold and cowardly souls who know neither victory nor defeat.  You are the representation for all humanity in the fight against time travel!!!   <br />
<br />
The brightest stars in the sky are those that shine for the benefit of others.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks Cat, for those lovely words. I greatly appreciate them <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />. I been here for years doing what I do, speaking out against the Time Travel threat. Making sure that 2 sides are consideredâ€¦ It can get a little tiresome, and stressful dealing with 1 sided people. <br />
<br />
But it's all worth it, when people come to the realization that things aren't always what they appear to be. Being aware of a 2nd side can be difficult for some to accept, but it's only the truth. <br />
<br />
Well thanks again Cat, for the pat on the back... I can tell we will be great colleagues in defending humanity from these Time Travelers someday <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />.<br />
