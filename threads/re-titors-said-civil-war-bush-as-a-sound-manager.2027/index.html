<br />
Edit to articles; would these two factors contribute to a stable dimension to the American work climate, outside of Titor's said claims of a revolution to come?<br />
<br />
In other words, is what the chief executive proposing here, with millions of American jobs now already being outsourced to other countries, such as India, promote a potential domesitc harmony, as well as stability?<br />
<br />
Under the title of time travel predictions, do these similarites have veracity, outside of any said influence by said said John Titor?\\<br />

Copy begins first article&gt;Bush to Propose Change in Immigration Law to Help Millions of Foreign Workers<br />
By Deb Riechmann Associated Press Writer <br />
Published: Jan 6, 2004  <br />
  <br />
WASHINGTON (AP) - A plan being proposed by President Bush would give legal status to foreign workers, including millions already toiling in America's underground economy, removing the fear of deportation but not putting them on a fast track toward permanent U.S. residency. <br />
<br />
In a speech Wednesday at the White House, Bush will ask Congress to approve changes to immigration policy, saying they would make the country safer by giving officials a better idea of who is crossing the border, bolster the economy by fulfilling employers' needs and protect illegal workers' rights. Also, in a nod to conservatives who oppose any reward to those who enter the United States illegally, Bush is including in his plan incentives to entice the workers to go back to their homelands. <br />
<br />
There are an estimated 8 million to 10 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, perhaps half from Mexico. <br />
<br />
Under the Bush proposal, which could smooth relations with Mexico and help Republicans lure Latino voters, foreign workers could apply for legal status for a three-year period if they had U.S. jobs. They could travel to and from the United States and possibly work in the country for additional three-year periods if approved by Congress. <br />
<br />
Senior administration officials who outlined the proposal for reporters Tuesday night said the president is calling for an unspecified, but &quot;reasonable,&quot; increase in the number of green cards available to workers. However, they said that being part of what is being called the &quot;temporary worker program&quot; would not give foreign workers any advantage to applying for green cards, or permanent residency status - the first step toward obtaining U.S. citizenship. <br />
<br />
Immigrant advocacy groups say the president's proposal falls short of comprehensive reform. On the other hand, groups wanting to curb immigration say the president's proposal for a three-year temporary worker plan, rewards foreign workers who broke the law when they entered the United States. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's a two-step amnesty,&quot; said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates strict immigration rules. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not what the folks on the left want, which is a quick green card, but it is an amnesty nonetheless,&quot; he said. &quot;It legalizes illegal immigrants and is going to increase the number of green cards so that people will be able to move through the system faster.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Extremely disappointing,&quot; said Cecilia Munoz, vice president for policy at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic immigrant advocacy group. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's a serious backtracking to where the president was two years ago when the administration was prepared to provide some kind of path to legal status,&quot; she said. &quot;They're proposing to invite people to be guest workers without providing any meaningful opportunity to remain in the United States to become legal permanent residents. It appears to be all about rewarding employers who have been hiring undocumented immigrants while offering almost nothing to the workers themselves.&quot; <br />
<br />
She said that under current immigration law, foreigners who have violated U.S. laws, including entering the country illegally, can be banned from re-entry for three years to life. The White House was unclear whether it wants to waive that law for illegal immigrants who participate in the temporary worker program. <br />
<br />
She also argued that there are only 5,000 green cards a year available for unskilled workers and the wait to get one is about 15 years. Congress would have to increase the number of green cards by hundreds of thousands to accommodate the millions of immigrants in the country illegally who would want to work, Munoz said. <br />
<br />
The announcement comes just before Bush's scheduled meeting with Mexico's President Vicente Fox next week at the Summit of the Americas in Monterrey, Mexico. Mexican officials have complained that the administration sought their help to improve border security and combat drug trafficking but failed to respond to pleas for an easing of U.S. immigration policy. <br />
<br />
Bush also is expected to broadly discuss giving workers from some countries expanded access to Social Security benefits, sources familiar with the plan said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <br />
<br />
Current law generally requires any worker - legal or illegal, citizen or non-citizen - in the United States to have a total of about 10 years of work history to become eligible for Social Security retirement benefits. Under reciprocal agreements the United States has with about 20 nations, some foreign workers are permitted to count work history in their native countries toward the 10 years they need to become eligible for Social Security benefits. These agreements also keep workers and employers from paying taxes into both countries' government retirement systems.  <br />

Mexican AG Probes Possible Terrorism Links <br />
<br />
By E. EDUARDO CASTILLO<br />
Associated Press Writer <br />
<br />
Note edit&gt;In an additional AP article titledBush to propose allowing foreign workers into U.S. in the body copy of this article, as a proposed agreement with Mexican President Vincente Fox, there is a probable allowance of letting ip to half the Mexican work-force into the United States.<br />
<br />
What is proposed here, would the U.S. have ample screaning abilties, to filter out any potential terrorist, at this proposed volume of workers?<br />
<br />
This fact would be in-light of the recient attempts of North Korean Nationals, who had tried to infiltrate into the Southern United States, utalizing the wak points along the U.S. Mexican Border\\<br />
 <br />
  <br />
Second article, copy&gt;MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico has begun a formal investigation into whether terrorists plan to use Mexican flights to launch an international attack, the top organized crime investigator in the country said Tuesday.<br />
<br />
The United States, Canada and Interpol told Mexico that officials suspect terrorists might be using Mexican soil to plan an attack, Deputy Attorney General Jose Vasconcelos told reporters.<br />
<br />
Officials canceled two Aeromexico flights from Mexico City to Los Angeles last week because of terrorism concerns, but Mexican authorities found no evidence of an attack plot.<br />
<br />
A formal investigation was opened in the first days of January &quot;because of the exchange of information about the probability that there could be some attack or terrorist act against some airport installation in Mexico,&quot; Vasconcelos said.<br />
<br />
The type of investigation Vasconcelos announced is an essential step toward filing criminal charges under Mexican law. Vasconcelos wouldn't say if authorities planned to charge anyone for conspiring to commit acts of terrorism, however.<br />
<br />
He said investigators did not have specific information about whether there was going to be an attack against an airplane. &quot;It is just the probability of a terrorist act in flights that are leaving Mexico City,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
On Monday, Mexico said it had increased security measures for international flights two weeks before the canceled flights, and had placed armed Mexican agents on some flights bound for the United States. The measures have delayed many flights by at least 30 minutes and sometimes for hours.<br />
<br />
Unarmed U.S. agents also have been seen at the airport, apparently checking passenger lists and sharing information with Mexican officials.<br />
<br />
Miguel Angel de la Torre, chief of the police Special Operations Group, said Tuesday that about a dozen patrol cars have been circling the airport watching for suspicious activity.<br />
<br />
Officials say that hundreds of police and security agents from a battery of agencies are involved in the security operation in Mexico City.<br />

			"articleBody": "Re:Titor's said civil war; Bush as a sound manager\n\nEdit to articles; would these two factors contribute to a stable dimension to the American work climate, outside of Titor's said claims of a revolution to come?\n\nIn other words, is what the chief executive proposing here, with millions of American jobs now already being outsourced to other countries, such as India, promote a potential domesitc harmony, as well as stability?\n\nUnder the title of time travel predictions, do these similarites have veracity, outside of any said influence by said said John Titor?\\\\\n\nCopy begins first article>Bush to Propose Change in Immigration Law to Help Millions of Foreign Workers\nBy Deb Riechmann Associated Press Writer \nPublished: Jan 6, 2004  \n  \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A plan being proposed by President Bush would give legal status to foreign workers, including millions already toiling in America's underground economy, removing the fear of deportation but not putting them on a fast track toward permanent U.S. residency. \n\nIn a speech Wednesday at the White House, Bush will ask Congress to approve changes to immigration policy, saying they would make the country safer by giving officials a better idea of who is crossing the border, bolster the economy by fulfilling employers' needs and protect illegal workers' rights. Also, in a nod to conservatives who oppose any reward to those who enter the United States illegally, Bush is including in his plan incentives to entice the workers to go back to their homelands. \n\nThere are an estimated 8 million to 10 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, perhaps half from Mexico. \n\nUnder the Bush proposal, which could smooth relations with Mexico and help Republicans lure Latino voters, foreign workers could apply for legal status for a three-year period if they had U.S. jobs. They could travel to and from the United States and possibly work in the country for additional three-year periods if approved by Congress. \n\nSenior administration officials who outlined the proposal for reporters Tuesday night said the president is calling for an unspecified, but \"reasonable,\" increase in the number of green cards available to workers. However, they said that being part of what is being called the \"temporary worker program\" would not give foreign workers any advantage to applying for green cards, or permanent residency status - the first step toward obtaining U.S. citizenship. \n\nImmigrant advocacy groups say the president's proposal falls short of comprehensive reform. On the other hand, groups wanting to curb immigration say the president's proposal for a three-year temporary worker plan, rewards foreign workers who broke the law when they entered the United States. \n\n\"It's a two-step amnesty,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates strict immigration rules. \n\n\"It's not what the folks on the left want, which is a quick green card, but it is an amnesty nonetheless,\" he said. \"It legalizes illegal immigrants and is going to increase the number of green cards so that people will be able to move through the system faster.\" \n\n\"Extremely disappointing,\" said Cecilia Munoz, vice president for policy at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic immigrant advocacy group. \n\n\"It's a serious backtracking to where the president was two years ago when the administration was prepared to provide some kind of path to legal status,\" she said. \"They're proposing to invite people to be guest workers without providing any meaningful opportunity to remain in the United States to become legal permanent residents. It appears to be all about rewarding employers who have been hiring undocumented immigrants while offering almost nothing to the workers themselves.\" \n\nShe said that under current immigration law, foreigners who have violated U.S. laws, including entering the country illegally, can be banned from re-entry for three years to life. The White House was unclear whether it wants to waive that law for illegal immigrants who participate in the temporary worker program. \n\nShe also argued that there are only 5,000 green cards a year available for unskilled workers and the wait to get one is about 15 years. Congress would have to increase the number of green cards by hundreds of thousands to accommodate the millions of immigrants in the country illegally who would want to work, Munoz said. \n\nThe announcement comes just before Bush's scheduled meeting with Mexico's President Vicente Fox next week at the Summit of the Americas in Monterrey, Mexico. Mexican officials have complained that the administration sought their help to improve border security and combat drug trafficking but failed to respond to pleas for an easing of U.S. immigration policy. \n\nBush also is expected to broadly discuss giving workers from some countries expanded access to Social Security benefits, sources familiar with the plan said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n\nCurrent law generally requires any worker - legal or illegal, citizen or non-citizen - in the United States to have a total of about 10 years of work history to become eligible for Social Security retirement benefits. Under reciprocal agreements the United States has with about 20 nations, some foreign workers are permitted to count work history in their native countries toward the 10 years they need to become eligible for Social Security benefits. These agreements also keep workers and employers from paying taxes into both countries' government retirement systems.  \n\nAssociated Press writers Suzanne Gamboa, Leigh Strope and Robert Gehrke contributed to this report. \n\nAP-ES-01-06-04 2210EST\n\nCopyright 2003 Associated Press\n\nMexican AG Probes Possible Terrorism Links \n\nBy E. EDUARDO CASTILLO\nAssociated Press Writer \n\nNote edit>In an additional AP article titledBush to propose allowing foreign workers into U.S. in the body copy of this article, as a proposed agreement with Mexican President Vincente Fox, there is a probable allowance of letting ip to half the Mexican work-force into the United States.\n\nWhat is proposed here, would the U.S. have ample screaning abilties, to filter out any potential terrorist, at this proposed volume of workers?\n\nThis fact would be in-light of the recient attempts of North Korean Nationals, who had tried to infiltrate into the Southern United States, utalizing the wak points along the U.S. Mexican Border\\\\\n \n  \nSecond article, copy>MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico has begun a formal investigation into whether terrorists plan to use Mexican flights to launch an international attack, the top organized crime investigator in the country said Tuesday.\n\nThe United States, Canada and Interpol told Mexico that officials suspect terrorists might be using Mexican soil to plan an attack, Deputy Attorney General Jose Vasconcelos told reporters.\n\nOfficials canceled two Aeromexico flights from Mexico City to Los Angeles last week because of terrorism concerns, but Mexican authorities found no evidence of an attack plot.\n\nA formal investigation was opened in the first days of January \"because of the exchange of information about the probability that there could be some attack or terrorist act against some airport installation in Mexico,\" Vasconcelos said.\n\nThe type of investigation Vasconcelos announced is an essential step toward filing criminal charges under Mexican law. Vasconcelos wouldn't say if authorities planned to charge anyone for conspiring to commit acts of terrorism, however.\n\nHe said investigators did not have specific information about whether there was going to be an attack against an airplane. \"It is just the probability of a terrorist act in flights that are leaving Mexico City,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, Mexico said it had increased security measures for international flights two weeks before the canceled flights, and had placed armed Mexican agents on some flights bound for the United States. The measures have delayed many flights by at least 30 minutes and sometimes for hours.\n\nUnarmed U.S. agents also have been seen at the airport, apparently checking passenger lists and sharing information with Mexican officials.\n\nMiguel Angel de la Torre, chief of the police Special Operations Group, said Tuesday that about a dozen patrol cars have been circling the airport watching for suspicious activity.\n\nOfficials say that hundreds of police and security agents from a battery of agencies are involved in the security operation in Mexico City.\n\nCopyright 2004 Associated Press.
