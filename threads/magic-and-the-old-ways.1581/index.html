								<div class="bbWrapper">Regarding wizards and witches, I think that whatever you beleive in can and will happen, depending on how hard you want something to happen. The old ways talk of many wizards and witches, look at the Merlin story.. it was only a myth, but who really knows for sure. If you have seen this movie you will notice at the end when everyone turns their back on Mab the evil witch, they stop beleiving and she dissapears. They say that we ( Our Minds ) create our surroundings and our world, and I think its true, If a sorcerer beleives in what he does, and these guys were not doubtfull at all, they were true beleivers in what they could do, then anything was and is possible.<br />
Same goes for todays healers, people have been healed by the power of prayer, its all possible when you beleive.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Re: Magic' the old ways, what better?</b><br />
<br />
What is not understood about the word witch, is that in some circles, this term simply means utility agent and nothing more.<br />
<br />
As short a time ago, as the late 18th century in England, the last covens of Essex's on Avon had existed.<br />
<br />
There is a telling of a male witch and a few female left, within the Essex On Avon area, near the Village Of Eastwick, to be exact.<br />
<br />
In England these were older witches, who were in danger of being swept aside, by the industrial revolution.<br />
<br />
An elder witch, George was his name, had the power to stop heavy machinery with only a glance.He did so by hex fixing it there, till the farmers had asked him to let go of his casting on the steam powered tractors.<br />
<br />
These few valuable witches, were what they were, inspite of the Anti-witchcraft act, often 1700s and kept to themselves.<br />
<br />
They could also stop large horses, and donkeys with a raise of their canes.<br />
This forced sometimes asked stopping, was so in order to take firewood to their little shanties. <br />
<br />
In some cases these bundeles weighed over fifty pounds, plus vittles for the evening fare.<br />
<br />
A lot of witches in other communities, had served as readily accessible medicos, as well as fortune tellers, advisors and other supernatural helpers, at low or sometimes bartered cost.<br />
<br />
When many increased his presence in both technology, as well as the gaudiness of his own ego, a lot of these very value people had been swept to the wayside.<br />
<br />
They call today a better place, due to the advent of supposed technology being so valuble.<br />
<br />
However what seems to be lost in the fray of supposed new and better technical ways, are once respected community advisors.These were people who were simply swept away, by those who through that their way was better.<br />
<br />
The quality of today, with too much population wanting better ways of living, out of bottles, without any reverence to past mystical ways, is better Sam?<br />
<br />
They have even dragged the once hallowed learned good arts of some phases of utility craft through the mud, in order to promote the dark side of this arts, as well as give it to Hollywood.<br />
<br />
Of course we as a society today have learned from our past mistakes?<br />
<br />
Thanks Samuel.</div>

<br />
My Friends<br />
<br />
It is funny that you two intermingled magic in a time travel forum.  And one would think that impossible but read about this.<br />
<br />
Some time ago, in the small New England town of Worcester in Mass, there was suppose to be a witch leaving there with her three male consorts. This according to one Goodman Doleman, who was the towns leatherer.  When the group of four was arrested and accused and sent to trial the woman claiming that they were all inmigrants from The Netherlands was ordered shut and separated from her friends.  Some say that she entered into a fasting ritual calling upon the forces of evil, but she simply stropped eating because of the traumatic stress incarceration can impose upon a person.  The other three were ironed and sent to the holding place until the bishop, who was to conduct the hearing, arrived from Holliston.  <br />
Three days went by and something strange ocuured.  The woman was heard to have spoken in a strange tongue and then silently died.  This event caused much up heaval among the citizens who now did not want to wait for the arrival of the bishop for them to hang the poor souls.  Terror ran amok for the following five days.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in FarraTR078.3689/2750^1723EarthTR078.3689 a great event ocurred nearly three thousand years after the event in Worcester, Mass.  According to the people there a great solar flare sent hurling towards the planet an immense solar windcloud that messed up with every single eloctronic equipment in the world.  However it did something else too, it took back in time from that place in two persons that were there as spectators. <br />
<br />
Upon arrival they soon discovered that the supposed witches were refugees from Farra's past who had been implanted to Earth in order to exchange human/farran genetica material after the 25th generation in order to provide their people with a more stable physical constitution and endurance. They also found out that Goodman Doleman was a pawn under the influence of the bishop, who was in turn under the control of a descendant of a British-Raed'ka'noan merchant who wanted the farran experiment stopped for good so that the further exploitation of farrans would become easier.  The two persons then decided to free the farrans posing as humans and re-settle them somewhere in South America, what was to be known as Montevideo.<br />
<br />
After wards the two spectators returned to their own place by timephasing as the rest of the observers do.<br />
<br />
I do not intend you to believe this brief story but at least ponder about it, if it does not make any sense it will do good for a science fiction story.<br />
<br />
Until later becomes now.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">History of Witchcraft<br />
<br />
As I am trying to put this all together, I hope to bring about an <br />
understanding  that Witchcraft, like any religion, has  undergone <br />
it's  changes  throughout  the  centuries.   It  is  my  personal <br />
feeling,  however, that the religion of Witchcraft has  undergone <br />
far fewer changes than any other in history.<br />
<br />
Witchcraft,  sorcery, magic, whatever can only begin to find  its <br />
roots  when we go back as far as Mesopotamia. With their  dieties <br />
for  all  types of disasters, such as Utug - the Dweller  of  the <br />
Desert  waiting  to  take you away if you wandered  to  far,  and <br />
Telal  -  the  Bull  Demon,  Alal  -  the  destroyer,  Namtar   - <br />
Pestilence, Idpa - fever, and Maskim - the snaresetter; the  days <br />
of superstitution were well underway.<br />
<br />
It  was believed that the pharaohs, kings, etc. all  imbued  some <br />
power  of  the gods, and even the slightest  movement  they  made <br />
would cause an action to occur.  It was believed that a  picture, <br />
or  statue also carried the spirit of the person. This is one  of <br />
the reasons that they were carried from place to place, and  also <br />
explains  why  you  see so many pictures  and  statues  of  these <br />
persons with their hands straight to their sides. <br />
<br />
In  the Bible, we find reference to &quot;The Tower of Babel&quot;  or  The <br />
Ziggurat in Genesis 11. &quot;Now the whole world had one language and <br />
a  common speech.  As men moved eastward, they found a  plain  in <br />
Shinar  (Babylonia) and settled there.  They said to each  other, <br />
`Come,  let's  make bricks and bake them thoroughly.'  They  used <br />
brick  instead  of stone, and tar instead of mortar.   Then  they <br />
said,  `Come,  let us build ourselves a city, with a  tower  that <br />
reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for  ourselves <br />
and  not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.' But  the <br />
Lord  came down to see the city and the tower that the  men  were <br />
building.   The  Lord said,`If as one people  speaking  the  same <br />
language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do <br />
will  be  impossible for them.  Come let us go down  and  confuse <br />
their language so they will not understand each other.'&quot; It  goes <br />
on to say that the tower was never finished.<br />
<br />
In  other  references,  we  find that the  &quot;Tower&quot;  was  in  fact <br />
finished,  and that it was a tower that represented the  &quot;stages&quot; <br />
between earth and heaven (not a tower stretching to the heaven in <br />
the literal sense.) From this reference, it was a tower built  in <br />
steps.  A hierarchy on which heaven and hell were based.  It  was <br />
actually a miniature world representing the Mountain of Earth.<br />
.pa<br />
Each stage was dedicated to a planet, with its angles symbolizing <br />
the  four corners of the world.  They pointed to Akkad,  Saburtu, <br />
Elam,  and the western lands.  The seven steps of the tower  were <br />
painted  in different colors which corresponded to  the  planets.  <br />
The &quot;Great Misfortune:, Saturn, was black. The second was  white, <br />
the  color  of  Jupiter.   The third,  brick-red,  the  color  of <br />
Mercury,  followed by blue, Venus; yellow, Mars, gray  or  silver <br />
for  the  moon.  These  colors boded good  or  evil,  like  their <br />
planets.<br />
<br />
For the first time, numbers expressed the world order.  A  legend <br />
depicts  Pythagoras traveling to Babylon where he is  taught  the <br />
mystery  of numbers, their magical significance and  power.   The <br />
seven  steps often appear in magical philosophy. The seven  steps <br />
are: stones, fire, plants, animals, man, the starry heavens,  and <br />
the angels.  Starting with the study of stones, the man of wisdom <br />
will attain higher and higher degrees of knowledge, until he will <br />
be  able  to  apprehend the sublime,  and  the  eternal.  Through <br />
ascending  these steps, a man would attain the knowledge of  God, <br />
whose  name  is  at the eighth degree,  the  threshold  of  God's <br />
heavenly dwelling.  <br />
<br />
The  square  was  also a &quot;mystical&quot; symbol in  these  times,  and <br />
though divided into seven, was still respected.  This  correlated <br />
the  old tradition of a fourfold world being reconciled with  the <br />
seven heavens of later times. <br />
<br />
It is thought that here was the start to numerology, but for this <br />
to  have  developed  to  the point  where  they  had  taken  into <br />
consideration the square as the fourfold world, it would have had <br />
to have developed prior to this.<br />
<br />
From Mesopotamia lets move over to Persia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unlike  the Mesopotamians, and Egyptians, who believed  that  all <br />
was  done with either the favor or lack thereof of the Gods,  the <br />
Chaldean  star  religion taught that luck and  disaster  were  no <br />
chance  events,  but  were controlled from  the  heavenly  bodies <br />
(planets/stars) which send good and bad according to mathematical <br />
laws.  It was their belief that man was incapable of fighting the <br />
will  of  the  planet divinities. Though, the  more  this  system <br />
evolved,  the  more the wise men read ethical values  into  man's <br />
fate.  The  will of the stars was not  completely  separate  from <br />
man's behaviors. The stars were important, but not omnipotent  in <br />
deciding  man's fate. It was believed that the star Sirius  would <br />
carry  messages  to the higher gods and he returned  to  announce <br />
their will. <br />
<br />
Around  the  7th Century B.C. Zoroaster, the Median  prophet  was <br />
preaching the doctrines that evil could be avoided and  defeated. <br />
He  brought  about the principles of the good and  evil  spirits. <br />
Below,  we will look at the beliefs and influences of this  man's <br />
life which created the religion named after him. <br />
<br />
The  first of the belief structure had to do with Ormazd  (Ahura-<br />
Mazda) king of light, and his twin brother Ahriman  (Anro-Mainyu) <br />
prince of darkness.<br />
<br />
Zoroaster  brought  about  the belief in  the  &quot;holy  war&quot;  (that <br />
between  good  and  evil.) In this  faith,  the  archangels  (the <br />
spirits  of  Divine Wisdom,  Righteousness,  Dominion,  Devotion, <br />
Totality, and Salvation) and the demons (the spirits of  Anarchy, <br />
Apostasy,   Presumption,  Destruction,  Decay,  and  Fury)   were <br />
constantly  at  battle  with one another.   The  archangels  were <br />
controled by Ormazd and the demons by Ahriman.<br />
<br />
This  religion  had it's belief that in the end, Ormazd  and  his <br />
demons would prevail, but until then, Ormazd would keep the world <br />
safe.  <br />
<br />
It is interesting that the last of the demons (the demon of Fury) <br />
holds such a hard and fast thought that it was incorporated  into <br />
the  Hebrew and Christian belief structure. The last  archdemon's <br />
name is Aeshma Daeva also know to the Hebrews as Ashmadai and  to <br />
Christians as Asmodeus. <br />
<br />
Asmodeus was the &quot;chief of the fourth hierarchy of evil  demons&quot;, <br />
called  &quot;the  avengers of wickedness, crimes  and  misdeeds.&quot;  He <br />
appears  with  three heads, a bull's, human, and a ram.   He  has <br />
goose  feet, and a snake's tail. To appear more  frightening,  he <br />
also exhales fire and rides upon a dragon of hell.<br />
<br />
It  is said that Asmodeus is not to be feared.  When you  say  to <br />
him:  &quot;In truth thou art Asmodeus,&quot; he will give you a  wonderful <br />
ring.   He  will teach you geometry,  arithmetic,  astronomy  and <br />
mechanics. When questioned, he answers truthfully. <br />
<br />
The  other  demons  tempt people away from the  true  worship  of <br />
Mazda.   They  are  Paromaiti - Arrogance, Mitox  -  The  Falsely <br />
Spoken  Word,  Zaurvan - Decrepitude, Akatasa  -  Meddlesomeness, <br />
Vereno - Lust. <br />
<br />
Much  of the current day Christian beliefs were taken  from  this <br />
man's  religion.  (That of good and evil forces, the  redemption, <br />
the &quot;savior&quot; factor, etc.)<br />
<br />
From  here, let us move on to Egypt where we will look  at  other <br />
mystical symbols and more history of magic and the craft.<br />

<br />
The Sphinx was a mythological creature with lion's body and human <br />
head,  an important image in Egyptian and Greek art  and  legend.  <br />
The  word sphinx was derived by Greek grammarians from  the  verb <br />
sphingein (to bind or squeeze), but the etymology is not  related <br />
to the legend and is dubious.<br />
<br />
The winged sphinx of Boeotian Thebes, the most famous in  legend, <br />
was said to have terrorized the people by demanding the answer to <br />
a riddle. If the person answered incorrectly, he or she was eaten <br />
by  the sphinx.  It is said that Oedipus answered properly  where <br />
upon the sphinx killed herself.  <br />
<br />
The  earliest  and  most famous example in art  is  the  colossal <br />
Sphinx  at Giza, Egypt.  It dates from the reign of  King  Khafre <br />
(4th king of 4th dynasty; c. 2550 b.c.)<br />
<br />
The  Sphinx did not occur in Mesopotamia until around  1500  b.c. <br />
when  it was imported from the Levant.  In appearance, the  Asian <br />
sphinx differed from its Egyptian model mostly in the addition of <br />
wings  to the leonine body.  This feature continued  through  its <br />
history in Asia and the Greek world.  <br />
<br />
Another  version  of  the sphinx was that of  the  female.   This <br />
appeared  in  the  15th  century  b.c.  on  seals,  ivories   and <br />
metalworkings.   They  were  portrayed in  the  sitting  position <br />
usually  with one paw raised.  Frequently, they were seen with  a <br />
lion, griffin or another sphinx.<br />
<br />
The  appearance of the sphinx on temples and the like  eventually <br />
lead  to a possible interpretation of the sphinx as a  protective <br />
symbol as well as a philosophical one.<br />
<br />
The Sphinx rests at the foot of the 3 pyramids of Khufu,  Khafre, <br />
and  Menkure.  It talons stretch over the city of the dead as  it <br />
guards its secrets.<br />
<br />
The myth goes that a prince who later became Thutmose IV, took  a <br />
nap in the shadow of the half-submerged Sphinx. As he slept,  the <br />
Sun-god (whom the Sphinx represents, appeared to him in a  dream.  <br />
Speaking  to  him  as a son, he told the  prince  that  he  would <br />
succeed to the throne and enjoy a long and happy reign.  He urged <br />
the prince to have the Sphinx cleared of the sand.<br />
<br />
In his book on Isis and Osiris, Plutarch  (A.D. 45-126) says that <br />
the  Sphinx  symbolizes  the  secret  of  occult  wisdom,  though <br />
Plutarch  never unveiled the mysteries of the Sphinx. It is  said <br />
that  the magic of the Sphinx lies within the thousands of  hands <br />
that chiseled at the rock.  The thoughts of countless generations <br />
dwell  in it; numberless conjurations and rites have built up  in <br />
it  a mighty protective spirit, a soul that still  inhabits  this <br />
time-scarred giant. <br />
<br />
Another  well know superstition of the peoples of  Ancient  Egypt <br />
was that regarding their dead.<br />
<br />
They believed that in the West lies the World of the Dead,  where <br />
the Sun-god disappears every evening.  The departed were referred <br />
to as &quot;Westerners.&quot; It was believed that, disguised as birds, the <br />
dead  soar into the sky where in his heavenly barge Ra, the  Sun-<br />
god,  awaits them and transforms them into stars to  travel  with <br />
him through the vault of the heavens.<br />
<br />
The  occult of the dead reached it's height when it  incorporated <br />
the  Osiris  myth.   Osiris was born to  save  mankind.   At  his <br />
nativity,  a voice was heard proclaiming that the Lord  had  come <br />
into  the world (sound familiar?).  But his  brother/father  Seth <br />
shut  him  up  in  a chest which he carried to  the  sea  by  the <br />
Tanaitic mouth of the Nile.  Isis brought him back to life.  Seth <br />
then scattered his body all over the place.  It is said that Isis <br />
fastened  the limbs together with the help of the  gods  Nephtis, <br />
Thoth, and Horus, her son.  Fanning the body with her wings,  and <br />
through  her magic, Osiris rose again to reign as king  over  the <br />
dead.  <br />
<br />
The  Egyptian  believed that a person had two souls.   The  sould <br />
known  as Ba is the one that progressed into the afterlife  while <br />
the  Ka  remains  with the mummy. The Ka is believed  to  live  a <br />
magical  life  within  the  grave.   Thus  the  Egyptians  placed <br />
miniture belongings of the deceased into the tomb.  Such items as <br />
images, statuettes, imitation utensils, and miniture houses  take <br />
the place of the real thing.  They believed that the Ka would use <br />
these  as  the real item because the  mortuary  priests  possesed <br />
magic that would make them real for the dead. <br />
<br />
The priests believed that the gods could be deceived, menaced and <br />
forced  into  obedience.   They had such trust in  the  power  of <br />
magic,  the  virtue of the spoken word,  the  irresistibility  of <br />
magic gestures and other ritual, that they hoped to bend even the <br />
good  gods  to their will.  They would bring retribution  to  the <br />
deities  who  failed  to  deal leniently  with  the  dead.   They <br />
threatened  to  shoot lightning into the are of Shu, god  of  the <br />
air, who would then no longer be able to support the sky-goddess, <br />
and  her star-sown body would collapse, disrupting the  order  of <br />
all things. <br />
<br />
When Ikhnaton overthrew the Egyptian gods and demons, making  the <br />
cult  of the One God Aton, a state religion, he  also  suppressed <br />
mortuary magic.  Ikhnaton did not believe in life after death.<br />
<br />
As  Christianity  became  a part of this nation,  there  is  much <br />
evidence to show where the Christians of the time, and the pagans <br />
lived peacefully together.<br />

<br />
In  theology, the differences between early Christians,  Gnostics <br />
(members  -  often  Christian - of dualistic  sects  of  the  2nd <br />
century  a.d.), and pagan Hermetists were slight.  In  the  large <br />
Gnostic  library  discovered at Naj'Hammadi, in upper  Egypt,  in <br />
1945,  Hermetic writings were found side by side  with  Christian <br />
Gnostic  texts.   The  doctrine of the  soul  taught  in  Gnostic <br />
communities was almost identical to that taught in the mysteries: <br />
the soul emanated from the Father, fell into the body, and had to <br />
return to its former home.   <br />
<br />
It was not until later in Rome that things took a change for  the <br />
worse.  Which moves us on to Greece.<br />
<br />
The doctrinal similarity is exemplified in the case of the  pagan <br />
writer  and  philosopher  Synesius.  When the  people  of  Cyrene <br />
wanted  the  most able man of the city to be their  bishop,  they <br />
chose  Synesius,  a  pagan. He was able to  accept  the  election <br />
without  sacrificing  his  intellectual honesty.   In  his  pagan <br />
period,  he  wrote  hymns that follow the fire  theology  of  the <br />
Chaldean Oracles.  Later he wrote hymns to Christ.  The  doctrine <br />
is almost identical. <br />
<br />
To  attempt to demonstrate this...let's go to some  BASIC  tenets <br />
and beliefs of the two religions:<br />
<br />
                        Christian Beliefs<br />
<br />
The 10 Commandments <br />
<br />
1.) You shall have no other gods before me.<br />
<br />
To the Christian, this means there will be no other God.  Yet, in <br />
the bible, the phrase is plural.  I does not state that you  will <br />
not  have another god, it says that you will have no  other  gods <br />
before the Christian God.<br />
<br />
In  the case of the later, it could be interpreted to  mean  that <br />
whereas other gods can be recognised, as a Christian, this person <br />
should  place YHVH ahead of all gods recognising him/her  as  the <br />
supreme being of all. <br />
<br />
2.) You shall not worship idols<br />
<br />
Actually,  what it says in the New International Version is  &quot;You <br />
shall  not make for yourself an idol in the form af  anything  in <br />
heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.  You <br />
shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord  your <br />
God, am a jealour God, punishing the children for the sin of  the <br />
fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate  me, <br />
but   showing  love  to  thousands  who  love  me  and  keep   my <br />
commandments. <br />
<br />
3.) You shall not take the name of the lord in vain.<br />
<br />
This one is pretty self explanitory.  When a person is calling on <br />
the lord he/she is asking the lord for guidance or action.  Thus, <br />
the phrase &quot;God damn it!&quot; can be translated into a person  asking <br />
the  lord  to comdemn whatever &quot;it&quot; is to hell.  The  phrase  &quot;To <br />
damn&quot;  means  to  condem to hell.   In  modern  society,  several <br />
phrases such as the following are common usage:<br />
     &quot;Oh God!&quot;, &quot;God forbid!&quot;, &quot;God damn it!&quot;, &quot;God have mercy!&quot;<br />
Each  of these is asking God to perform some act upon or for  the <br />
speaker with the exception of &quot;Oh God!&quot; which is asking for  Gods <br />
attention. <br />
<br />
4.) Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy.<br />
<br />
Depending on which religion you are looking at (i.e. Jewish, from <br />
which  the 10 commandments come; or Christianity,  which  adapted <br />
them  for their use as well.) the Sabbath is either  Saturday  or <br />
Sunday.   You  may also take a look at the  various  mythological <br />
pantheons  to  corelate which is the first and last days  of  the <br />
week...(i.e. Sun - Sunday.. Genesis 1:3 &quot;And God said, &quot;Let there <br />
be  light,'  and there was light., Moon - Monday..  Genesis  1:14 <br />
&quot;And  God said,&quot;Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky  to <br />
separate  the day from the night, and let them serve as signs  to <br />
mark seasons and days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the <br />
expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.&quot; And it was so. 16 <br />
God  made two great lights - the greater light to govern the  day <br />
and  the  lesser  light to govern the night.  He  also  made  the <br />
stars.&quot;  Thus the Sun was created first.  With the day of the Sun <br />
being  the first in the week, then Saturday would be the  7th  or <br />
Sabbath. <br />
<br />
5.) Honor thy mother and thy father.<br />
<br />
This  is  another that is fairly self explainitory.   It  is  any <br />
parent's  right  after spending the time to raise you  to  expect <br />
that you respect them.  <br />
<br />
6.) You shall not murder.<br />
<br />
This does not say &quot;You shall not murder...except in my name.&quot;  It <br />
says YOU SHALL NOT MURDER. PERIOD. Out of the 10 commandments,  I <br />
have found that over the course of history, this one has been the <br />
most  ignored.   As we look as the spread  of  Christianity  from <br />
around 300 A.D. forward, we find that as politics moved into  the <br />
church  and  those  in charge of man's &quot;souls&quot;  were  given  more <br />
control that this one commandment sort of went out the window. <br />
<br />
We  see  such things as the Crusades, the  inquisition,  and  the <br />
dominating fear that was placed into the Christian &quot;psyche&quot;  that <br />
one should destroy that which is not like you.<br />
<br />
Even  though  we here stories about the &quot;witch trials&quot;,  and  the <br />
&quot;witch  burnings&quot; etc....There were actually very  few  &quot;Witches&quot; <br />
tried  or  burned.   Most  of  these  poor  souls  were  that  of <br />
Protestant  beliefs  (Against  the  Catholic  Church)  yet  still <br />
maintained that they were Christians. But...more on this later. <br />
<br />
7.) You shall not commit adultery.<br />
<br />
You  can  look  up the meaning in the dictionary,  and  this  one <br />
becomes  pretty self-evident.  What it comes down to is  that  no <br />
person who has ever been divorced can marry again, and you  don't <br />
have sex with someone that you are not married to. <br />
<br />
8.) You shall not steal.<br />
<br />
Again, enough said. However...don't go looking at Constantine  to <br />
be  obeying this one!  The Pagan temples were looted to make  his <br />
coinage.<br />
<br />
9.) You shall not give false witness against thy neighbor<br />
<br />
Again,  during the times of the inquisition, this also  went  out <br />
the window.  Such tools as torture were used to pull  confessions <br />
from  these  poor  people who then  signed  statements  that  the <br />
inquisitors  had written up saying that they freely  signed  this <br />
document.   Of course...the inquisitors stated that  this  person <br />
was  not tortured, but it was his clever wit that  had  extracted <br />
this confession.  <br />
<br />
It  was  also  during this time that persons,  refusing  to  take <br />
responsibility  for their own actions or accept that nature  does <br />
in  fact  create strange  circumstances...(i.e.  drought,  flood, <br />
etc.)  and  the resulting illness and  bug  infrestations.   Very <br />
often,  as the Witch-craze developed stronger, the  one  neighbor <br />
would  accuse another of Witchcraft and destroying the fields  or <br />
making their child sick, or whatever. <br />
<br />
10.)You shall not covet your neighbor.<br />
<br />
On  the  surface, this one is pretty  self  explainitory.   Don't <br />
crave your neighbor's possessions.  Yes...I can relate this  back <br />
to  the inquisitional times as well since most of  the  accused's <br />
property   reverted   back  to  the  Catholic  church   at   this <br />
time...there  were  several accused and convicted  of  Witchcraft <br />
simply because they would not sell their property to the  church. <br />
However...How  does  this effect persons today?  How  far  do  we <br />
carry the &quot;Thou shalt not covet...&quot;?  This can be even so much as <br />
a want, however is it a sin to want a toy like your neighbor has?  <br />
If so...we're all in trouble.  How many of us &quot;want&quot; that Porsche <br />
that  we see driving down the road?  Or how about that  beautiful <br />
house  that we just drove past?  Do we carry this commandment  to <br />
this extreme?  If so...I pity the person that can live by it  for <br />
what that would say is &quot;Thou shalt not DREAM.&quot; <br />
<br />
                         Wiccan Beliefs<br />
<br />
Since the religion of Wicca (or Witchcraft) is so diverse in it's <br />
beliefs,  I have included several documents here  that  encompass <br />
the majority of the traditions involved.  Again, this is simply a <br />
basis...NOT the be all and end all.<br />
<br />
                           Wiccan Rede<br />
<br />
                  Bide ye wiccan laws you must,<br />

<br />
                 A Pledge to Pagan Spirituality<br />
I  am  a Pagan and I dedicate Myself to channeling the  Spiritual <br />
Energy of my Inner Self to help and to heal myself and others.<br />
  <br />

differ from my own.<br />
  <br />
*  May I  use the  Force (psychic  power) wisely  and  never  use <br />
it   for aggression nor  for malevolent  purposes. May   I  never  <br />

on to  the best of my ability.<br />
  <br />
*  May I  always  remember  that whatever  is  sent  out   always  <br />

Pagan Spirit.<br />
  <br />

and   transform  it  into positivity. May  my Inner  Light  shine  <br />
so   strongly  that  malevolent forces can not even  approach  my <br />
sphere of existence.<br />
  <br />

.pa  <br />
*  May I  always channel  Love and  Light from  my  being.  May my  Inner <br />
Spirit, rather  than my ego self, guide all my thoughts, feelings, and <br />
actions.<br />
                          SO MOTE IT BE<br />
<br />
In  the  Wiccan Rede above, and scattered in the  oath,  we  find <br />
words  such  as Perfect Love and Perfect Trust.  What  are  these <br />
strange words and what do they mean?<br />
<br />
Before  one  can analyse the meaning behind the  phrase  &quot;Perfect <br />
Love  and  Perfect Trust&quot;, one must first define the  words.  For <br />
this  purpose, I will use the Webster's New World  Dictionary  of <br />
the  American  Language  1982 edition. Perfect:  adj.  [L.  per-, <br />
through  + facere, do] 1. complete in all respects;  flawless  2. <br />
excellent,  as  in  skill or quality 3.  completely  accurate  4. <br />
sheer;  utter  [a perfect fool] 5. Gram. expressing  a  state  or <br />
action completed at the time of speaking - vt. 1. to complete  2. <br />
to make perfect or nearly perfect - n. 1. the perfect tense 2.  a <br />
verb form in this tense - perfectly adv - perfectness n.<br />
<br />
Love: n. [&lt;OE. lufu]  1. strong affection or liking of someone or <br />
something. 2. a passionate affection for one of the opposite sex. <br />
3. The object of such affection, sweetheart. <br />
<br />
Trust:  n.[ON,  traust]  1.  a)  firm  belief  in  the   honesty, <br />
reliability,  etc.  of  another;  faith b)  the  one  trusted  2. <br />
confident  expectation,  hope, etc. 3.  responsibility  resulting <br />
from  confidence  placed in one. 4. Care,  custody  5.  something <br />
entrusted to one....<br />
<br />
Using  these  definitions,  we  come  up  with  &quot;Flawless  strong <br />
affection and flawless faith.<br />
<br />
Is this possible?  Those that follow the religion of Wicca  often <br />
give  excuses for this just being words.  When this is the  case, <br />
they are not obeying their faith....thus..they are not  following <br />
perfect love and perfect trust.  But to the rest...the answer  is <br />
a  resounding YES.  This does not ask that you &quot;like&quot;  a  person.  <br />
It asks that you see the divine light and love within  individual <br />
whether you like them or not.  Can this be done...YES. As to  the <br />
perfect  trust...we  can always trust a fox to be  a  fox  right. <br />
Therefore,  when we are entering circle, we can  honestly  answer <br />
perfect  trust even if it is on shaky ground.  We may have  faith <br />
that this person will act like any other human. <br />
<br />
It  with these beliefs and doctrines that I state that  not  only <br />
was   the  doctrine,  or  teaching  almost  identical,  but   the <br />
vocabulary was extensively the same.<br />
<br />
Greek  life  was  characterized  by  such  things  as  democratic <br />
institutions,  seafaring, athletics theatre and  philosophy.  The <br />
mystery  religions adopted many expressions from  these  domains. <br />
The  word  for their assembly was Ekklesia of  the  mystai.  They <br />
spoke of the voyage of life, the ship, the anchor and the port of <br />
religion,  and the wreath of the initiate.  The  Christians  took <br />
over the entire terminology, but had to twist many pagan words in <br />
order  to  fit  into the Christian world.   The  term  Leitourgia <br />
(meaning  service of the state) became the ritual or  liturgy  of <br />
the  church. The decree of the assembly and the opinions  of  the <br />
philosophers  (dogma) became the fixed doctrine of  Christianity.  <br />
The term for &quot;the correct opinion&quot; (orthe doxa) became orthodoxy. <br />
<br />
The  mysteries  declined  quickly when  the  emperor  Constantine <br />
raised Christianity to the status of the state religion.  After a <br />
short period of toleration, the pagan religions were  prohibited.  <br />
The  property of the pagan gods was confiscated, and the  temples <br />
were  destroyed.  The metal from which Constantine's gold  pieces <br />
were coined was taken from the pagan temple treasuries.<br />
<br />
The main pagan &quot;strong holds&quot; were Rome and Alexandria.  In Rome, <br />
the old aristocracy clung to the mysteries and in Alexandria  the <br />
pagan Neoplatonist philosophers expounded the mystery  doctrines. <br />
In  394, the opposition of the Roman aristocracy was  crushed  in <br />
the battle at the Frigidus River (modern stream of Vipacco, Italy <br />
and stream of Vipava, Yugoslavia). <br />
<br />
According  to  the Christian  theologian  Origen,  Christianity's <br />
development  during the time of the Roman Empire was part of  the <br />
divine  plan.   The whole Mediterranean world was united  by  the <br />
Romans,  and  the  conditions  for  missionary  work  were   more <br />
favorable  than  ever before.  He explains  the  similarities  as <br />
natural considering the cultures etc.  The mystery religions  and <br />
Christianity had many features in common.  Some examples of  this <br />
are  found in their time of preparation prior to initiation,  and <br />
periods  of fasting.  Their were pilgrimages, and new  names  for <br />
the  new  brethren.  Few of the early  Christian  &quot;congregations&quot; <br />
would   be  called  orthodox  according  to  later  more   modern <br />
standards. <br />
<br />
Though for many years, the pagan &quot;churches&quot; of this area tried to <br />
bring  about  a  unity  among  their  &quot;doctrines&quot;,  beliefs,  and <br />
practices  to  raise support for their practices,  the  Christian <br />
philosophies and doctrines were so organized and strong that this <br />
fell  as well.  Little did they know that a couple hundred  miles <br />
away, peoples were still worshipping in pagan temples.<br />
<br />
Let's take a look up north.<br />
<br />
The  worship of trees goes far back into the history of man.   It <br />
was  not until Christianity converted the Lithuanians toward  the <br />
close of the 14th century that tree worship was thought to be  in <br />
the  past.  The truth is...whereas they are not  worshiped,  they <br />
are  still  honored by society today in the burning of  the  Yule <br />
log, May Day bon-fires, Kissing under the Mistletoe, and the ever <br />
famous Christmas tree. <br />
<br />
The worship of the oak tree or god appears to have been universal <br />
by  all branches of the Aryan stock in Europe.  Both  Greeks  and <br />
Italians  associated  the tree with their highest  god,  Zeus  or <br />
Jupiter,  the  divinity of the sky, the rain,  and  the  thunder.  <br />
Possibly one of the oldest and most famous sanctuaries in  Greece <br />
was  that of Dodona, where Zeus was revered in th  oracular  oak.  <br />
The  thunderstorms  which  are  said  to  rage  at  Dodona   more <br />
frequently than anywhere else in Europe, would render the spot  a <br />
fitting  home  for  the god whose voice was heard  alike  in  the <br />
rustling of the oak leaves and in the crash of thunder.  <br />
<br />
Zeus  of Greece, and Jupiter of Italy both were gods  of  thunder <br />
and rain, and to both the oak tree were sacred.<br />
<br />
To  the  Celts,  or Druids, their worship was  conducted  in  oak <br />
groves.  The Celtic conquerors, who settled in Asia in the  third <br />
century b.c., appear to have carried with them the worship of the <br />
oak to their new home.  In the heart of Asia Minor, the  Galatian <br />
senate  met in a place which bore the Celtic name of  Drynemetum, <br />
&quot;the sacred oak grove&quot; or &quot;the temple of the oak.&quot;<br />
<br />
In  Germany, we find that the veneration for sacred groves  seems <br />
to  have held the foremost place.  According to Grimm, the  chief <br />
of their holy trees was the oak.  Again, here we find that it  is <br />
dedicated to the god of thunder, Donar or Thunar, the  equivalent <br />
of  the Norse Thor. Among the Slavs, the oak tree was  sacred  to <br />
the  thunder god Perun. Among the Lithuanians, the oak  tree  was <br />
sacred to Perkunas or Perkuns, the god of thunder and rain. <br />
 <br />
The  Christmas  tree,  usually  a  balsam  or  douglas  fir,  was <br />
decorated  with  lights  and ornaments as  a  part  of  Christmas <br />
festivities.   The use of evergreen trees, wreaths, and  garlands <br />
as  a symbol of eternal life was an old custom of the  Egyptians, <br />
<br />
Chinese,  and  Hebrews.   Tree worship, common  among  the  pagan <br />
Europeans, survived after their conversion to Christianity in the <br />
Scandinavian  customs  of  decorating the  house  and  barn  with <br />
evergreens at the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting <br />
up a tree for the birds during Christmastime.  It survived in the <br />
custom  observed  in Germany, of placing a Yule tree  inside  the <br />
house in the midwinter holidays.<br />
<br />
The  modern  Christmas tree originated in Western  Germany.   The <br />
main prop of a popular medieval play about Adam and Eve was a fir <br />
tree  hung  with apples (the tree of Paradise)  representing  the <br />
Garden  of Eden.  The Germans set up the Paradise tree  in  their <br />
homes  on December 24, the religious feast day of Adam  and  Eve.  <br />
They hung wafers on it (symbolizing the host, the Christian  sigh <br />
of redemption).  In later tradition, the wafers were replaced  by <br />
cookies  of  various  shapes.  Candles were often  added  as  the <br />
symbol  of Christ, though they were also a pagan symbol  for  the <br />
light of the God.<br />
<br />
As  we  can see, even though the pagan community  has  been  trod <br />
upon,  it  was  never  destroyed.   The  date  of  Christmas  was <br />
purposely  fixed on December 25 to push into the  background  the <br />
great  festival of the sun god, and the Epiphany on January 5  to <br />
supplant  an  Egyptian festival of the same day  and  the  Easter <br />
ceremonies were set to rival the pagan spring festival. <br />
<br />
Let's take a look at a few of the holidays and compare.<br />

<br />

<br />
Easter<br />
On Easter Sunday, everywhere, the children hunt the many  colored <br />
Easter  eggs, brought by the Easter rabbit.  This is the  vestige <br />
of  a  fertility rite, the eggs and the rabbit  both  symbolizing <br />
fertility.  The  rabbit was the escort of  the  Germanic  goddess <br />
Ostara  who  gave her name to the festival by way of  the  German <br />
Ostern. <br />
<br />
The first day of Spring holds much in the way of folklore.  It is  <br />
also  known  as the Spring Equinox, Ostara, Eostre's  Day,  Alban <br />
Eilir,  the  Vernal Equinox, or Festival of the Trees.  It  takes <br />
place  between March 19 and 22.  It marks the first day  of  true <br />
spring (verses the balmy weather that may procede it.)<br />
<br />
The day and night is equal on this day, thus the name of Equinox. <br />
There is a story in one culture that says that the sun has  begun <br />
to  win it's race with the night and that the days get longer  as <br />
the sun pulls ahead. (Followed by the fact that the sun begins to <br />
lose  the  race at Mid-Summer, and loses the race  at  Mid-Winter <br />
just to start the race again the next day.)<br />
<br />
It  is  a time of beginnings, of action, of  planting  seeds  for <br />
future grains, and of tending gardens. On the first Sunday  after <br />
the  first full moon following Eostre's Day (the name from  which <br />
the  Easter was derived), the Christian religion celebrates  it's <br />
Easter Day.<br />
<br />
Spring  is  a time of the Earth's renewal, a  rousing  of  nature <br />
after the cold sleep of winter.  As such, it is an ideal time  to <br />
clean your home to welcome the new season.<br />
<br />
Spring cleaning is more than physical work.  Some cultures see it <br />
as  a  concentrated  effort on their part to  rid  themselves  of <br />
problems  and  negativity  of the past  months  and  tho  prepare <br />
themselves for the coming spring and summer.  <br />
<br />
To  do this, they approach the task of cleaning their homes  with <br />
positive thoughts.  They believe that this frees the homes of the <br />
hard  feelings brought about by a harsh winter. Even  then,  they <br />
have  guidlines that they follow such as any scrubbing of  stains <br />
or  hand  rubbing  the floors should be  done  in  a  &quot;clockwise&quot; <br />
motion.   It is their belief that this aids in filling  the  home <br />
with good energy for growth.<br />
<br />
To the Druidic faith, this is a sacred day occuring in the  month <br />
of  Fearn (meaning, &quot;I am the shining tear of the Sun&quot;). Part  of <br />
thier  practices  are to clean and  rededicate  outdoor  shrines, <br />
beliving that in doing so they honor the spring maiden.  This  is <br />
a  time  of fertility of both crops and families.   In  promoting <br />
crops,  they believe that the use of fire and water (the sun  and <br />
rain)  will  reanimate all life on Earth.   They  decorate  hard- <br />
boiled  eggs, the symbol of rebirth, to eat during  their  rites, <br />
and  such foods as honey cakes and milk punch can also be  found. <br />
The  mothers and daughters give dinners for each other  and  give <br />
cards and gifts as a way of merging with the natural flow of life <br />
and  with each other. (The Druids consider this also as  Mother's <br />
Day.)<br />
<br />
In Greek mythology, spring was the time when Persephone  returned <br />
from  the  underworld (where the seed was planted in  the  barren <br />
winter  months) and thus represents the seedlings of the  spring. <br />
Demeter, Persephone's mother represents the fertile earth and the <br />
ripend  grain of harvest since it is alleged that she is the  one <br />
that  created  the need to harvest crops when  her  daughter  was <br />
kidnapped  and  taken  to  the underworld.   It  was  through  an <br />
arrangement that her daughter could return for 1/2 the year  that <br />
Demeter allowed the crops to spring forth for that time until she <br />
again went into mourning for her daughter in the fall.<br />
<br />
In some cultures, even today, the ones that continue to celebrate <br />
the  rites  of  spring rise on Easter morning to  watch  the  sun <br />
&quot;Dance&quot; as it rises.<br />
<br />
The Christian festival commenmorating the resurrection of Christ, <br />
synchronized  with  the  Jewish Pesach,  and  blended  since  the <br />
earliest  days of Christianity with pagan European rites for  the <br />
renewed  season.   In all countries Easter falls  on  the  Sunday <br />
after  the  first  full moon on or following  March  21.   It  is <br />
preceded by a period of riotous vegetation rites and by a  period <br />
of  abstinence,  Lent (in Spain Cuaresma, Germany  Lenz,  central <br />
Italy, Quaresima) and by special rites of Holy Week.<br />
<br />
Everywhere  Easter  Sunday is welcomed with  rejoicing,  singing, <br />
candle processionals, flowers in abundance, and ringing of church <br />
bells.   Many pagan customs survive, such as the lighting of  new <br />
fires  at  dawn, among the Maya as well as in Europe,  for  cure, <br />
renewed life, and protection of the crops.   <br />
<br />
May Day<br />
The first day of May: observed as a spring festival everywhere in <br />
Europe, the United States, and Canada, and as a labor festival in <br />
certain European countries.  <br />
<br />
Rites such as the ever famous May Pole occur in the town  squares <br />
or  in the family's front yard.  The gathering of green  branches <br />
and  flowers on May Eve is the symbolic act of bringing home  the <br />
May, i.e. bringing new life, the spring, into the village.<br />
<br />
The  May Queen (and often King) is choosen from among  the  young <br />
people, and they go singing from door to door throughout the town <br />
carrying  flowers  or the May tree, soliciting  donations  for  a <br />
merrymaking  in  return  for  the &quot;blessing  of  May&quot;.   This  is <br />
symbolic of bestowing and sharing of the new creative power  that <br />
is stirring in the world.  As the kids go from door to door,  the <br />
May Bride often sings to the effect that those who give will  get <br />
of nature's bounty through the year.<br />
<br />
In parts of France, some jilted youth will lie in a field on  May <br />
Day  and  pretend to sleep.  If any village girl  is  willing  to <br />
marry  him, she goes and wakes him with a kiss; the pair then  go <br />
to  the village inn together and lead the dance  which  announces <br />
their engagement.  The boy is called &quot;the betrothed of May.&quot;<br />
<br />
This  festival is also known as Beltane, the Celtic May  Day.  It <br />
officially  begins  at  moonrise on May Day Eve,  and  marks  the <br />
beginning  of  the third quarter or second half  of  the  ancient <br />
Celtic  year.   It is celebrated as an  early  pastoral  festival <br />
accompanying the first turning of the herds out to wild  pasture.  <br />
The  rituals  were held to promote fertility.   The  cattle  were <br />
driven  between the Belfires to protect them from ills.   Contact <br />
with the fire was interpreted as symbolic contact with the sun.  <br />
<br />
The  rowan  branch  is hung over the house fire  on  May  Day  to <br />
preserve  the fire itself from bewitchment (the house fire  being <br />
symbolic of the luck of the house. <br />
<br />
In early Celtic times, the druids kindled the Beltane fires  with <br />
specific incantations.  Later the Christian church took over  the <br />
Beltane  observances, a service was held in the church,  followed <br />
by a procession to the fields or hills, where the priest  kindled <br />
the fire.<br />
<br />
In some rituals, a King and Queen May symbolize the male and female <br />
principles of productivity. <br />
<br />
We  have looked briefly at the similarities of  the  philosophies <br />
and vocabularies, but is that all that they had in common?  Let's <br />
look at symbologies.<br />
<br />
For  many years, the cross has been the symbol  representing  the <br />
death  of the Christian Christ.  It has represented that  through <br />
his  death, man could be reborn into God's grace.  Thus, we  have <br />
the  philosophy  of life in death being connected to  the  cross.  <br />
Is  this the only time where this symbol was recognized as  such?  <br />
Let's go back to Egypt and find out.<br />
<br />
An upright piece of wood, tied to a horizontal beam indicated the <br />
height  of  the  flood waters on the Nile.  This  beam  formed  a <br />
cross.   If  the  waters  failed to rise  during  the  season  of <br />
planting,  it  meant a poor harvest for these people.   Thus  the <br />
cross was revered as a symbol of life and regeneration. <br />
<br />
The Ankh represents the genitals of both sexes.  The cross itself <br />
is  a  primitive form of the phallus, and the loop  that  of  the <br />
womb. Again, we continue the symbol of the cross as the giver  of <br />
life.<br />
<br />
Oh  my gosh...did I use the word phallus in connection  with  the <br />
cross?  Oops!  <br />
<br />
Yes...even  prior  to  this time was the cross a  symbol  of  the <br />
phallus  or  fertility.   This is not the  only  thing  that  the <br />
phallus has symbolized over the many centuries within and without <br />
the pagan world.  It has also been used as a symbol of strength.<br />
<br />
Within the Bible, we find several references to the horn also  as <br />
a  symbol of strength.<br />
<br />
2 Samuel 22:3 - He is my shield, and the horn of my salvation.<br />
Luke 1:69 - And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us.<br />
Psalm 18:2 - He is my shield and the horn of my salvation.<br />
<br />
The move from horn to helmet is followed up also in the bible  as <br />
follows:<br />
Isaiah 59:17 - For he put an helmet of salvation upon his head.<br />
Ephesians 6:17 - Take the helmet of salvation.<br />
1  Thessalonians  5:8  -  ...putting  on  faith  and  love  as  a <br />
breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. <br />
<br />
In  Roman days a warrior would were horns on his helmet.   If  he <br />
came back defeated, he was said to have been dehorned.  There are <br />
several  references  where a soldier who lost his helmet  on  the <br />
field  was killed for this offense because it meant dishonor  for <br />
him to loose his horn.<br />
<br />
Shakespeare had much knowledge of the use of horns as a symbol of <br />
protection  and victory as is evident in his works &quot;As  You  Like <br />
It&quot; (IV,2) and in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; (II,4:16) when he writes: <br />
&quot;Let's  write  good  angell on the devill's horne;  tis  not  the <br />
devill's crest.&quot; <br />
<br />
Even  in modern days, the Catholic Church uses this  symbol  when <br />
setting  the mitre upon the head of a newly  consecrated  bishop.  <br />
The  words used at such a time are: &quot;We set on the head  of  this <br />
Bishop,  O  Lord,  Thy champion, the helmet  of  defense  and  of <br />
salvation, that with comely face and with his head armed with the <br />
horns  of  either  Testament  he  may  appear  terrible  to   the <br />
gainsayers of the truth, and may become their vigorous assailant, <br />
through  the abundant gift of Thy grace, who didst make the  face <br />
of Thy servant Moses to shine after familiar converse with  Thee, <br />
and  didst adorn it with the resplendent horns of Thy  brightness <br />
and Thy truth and commandedst the mitre to be set on the head  of <br />
Aaron,  Thy high priest, Etc...&quot; (Copies in Latin and  translated <br />
can be found in The Order Consecration of a Bishop Elect with the <br />
imprimatur  of H. Card. Vaughn, p. 14, Burns and Oates, 1893.)  <br />
<br />
If  we are looking at protections and the like, we must  look  at <br />
the  use of stones and crystals within our lives.  Yes,  even  in <br />
the Christain bible, the powers and uses of stones is  mentioned. <br />
Exodus  28:15-21 - &quot;Fashion a breastpiece for making decisions  - <br />
the  work  of a skilled craftsman.  MAke it like  the  ephod:  of <br />
gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted <br />
linen.  It is to be square - a span (9 inches) wide - and  folded <br />
double.   Then mount four rows of precious stones on it.  In  the <br />
first  row  there shall be a ruby, a topaz and a  beryl;  in  the <br />
second  row  a  turquoise, a sapphire (or lapis  lazuli)  and  an <br />
emerald; in the third row a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst; in <br />
the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx and a jasper.  Mount them in <br />
gold  filigree settings.  There are to be twelve stones, one  for <br />
each  of  the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved  like  a <br />
seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exodus  28:9-14  - Take two onyx stones and engrave  on  the  the <br />
names  of  the sons of Israel in the order of their birth  -  six <br />
names  on one stone and the remaining six on the other.   Engrave <br />
the  names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the way a  gem <br />
cutter  engraves a seal. Then mount the stones in  gold  filigree <br />
settings  and fasten them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod  as <br />
memorial  stones  for the sons of Israel.  Aaron is to  bear  the <br />
names on his shoulders as a memorial before the Lord.  Make  gold <br />
filigree  settings  and two braided chains of pure gold,  like  a <br />
rope, and attach the chains to the settings. <br />
<br />
Though it does not say as much, we might take the engraving as  a <br />
form of runes, again creating a similarity between the craft  and <br />
religions of old.<br />
<br />
From  man's search for protection, we come to the telling by  the <br />
stars...Astrology, and the use of stars as protectors of man.<br />
<br />
The  lore behind the star of David is an interesting  tale.   The <br />
easy interpretation is that of Zionism.  The more research you do <br />
on  this though, you will find that once again, depending on  the <br />
cultures  you  look at, it's interpretation  changes.   The  six-<br />
pointed  star  formed  by the superimposing of  one  triangle  on <br />
another.  The symbol is a combination of the male (apex  upwards) <br />
and female (apex downwards) triangles;  it is said, in cabalistic <br />
writings, to comprise the signs of the four elements and the four <br />
letters of the Tetragrammaton, and thus it came to be the  symbol <br />
for God.  Since the Biblical commandment puts a taboo on the  use <br />
of  the Name of God and on the depiction of God, the  symbol  was <br />
inscribed as the graphic representation of God in synagogues  and <br />
wherever the Name was appropriate.  In alchemy, the star of David <br />
combined  the  symbols  for  fire  and  water;  hence,  it  meant <br />
distillation.   Until recently, therefore, it appeared  on  shops <br />
selling  brandy.  The star of David is the symbol of Zionism  and <br />
appears  on the flag of Israel.  As Solomon's seal, the  hexagram <br />
possessed  power to control demons of all kinds.  The stopper  on <br />
the  bottle containing the bottle imp or jinni was  stamped  with <br />
the  seal  of Solomon.  In the Nsibidi script of West  Africa,  a <br />
native  form  of  writing,  the symbol  means  ardent  love;  the <br />
universality  of  the  male-female content of the  sign  is  here <br />
apparent. <br />
<br />
Astrology also has interesting roots.  Though the word itself  is <br />
made  up of the Greek words meaning &quot;star logic&quot; (astra  -  star, <br />
Logos  - logic), the actual origin is yet to be  determined.   We <br />
read  in the Epic of Creation of Sumer - Akkad, or Early  Babylon <br />
(ca  2200-1900  B.C.)  that:  &quot;The  Star  -  Jupiter  who  brings <br />
prophecies  to all is my Lord.  My Lord be at peace.  The Star  - <br />
Mercury  allows rain to fall. The Star - Saturn, the star of  Law <br />
and Justice...&quot;<br />
<br />
The  telling  of fortunes by the stars underwent an  avid  growth <br />
spurt during the times of the Roman Empire, and though with minor <br />
qualms with the Christian church, it co-existed peacefully  until <br />
the  time  of  Constantine  when  all  &quot;pagan&quot;  activities   were <br />
outlawed.  Though  outlawed within the  Roman  Empire,  Astrology <br />
continued to thrive within the Middle East.<br />
<br />
I  realize that I said that I would touch on the inquisition  and <br />
such,  however, I think that it is common knowledge the  document <br />
used to persecute those involved was written by the Friars within <br />
the  Catholic  Church  at the time.  The  document,  The  Malleus <br />
Maleficarum,  was a document designed to bring about fear  within <br />
the  Christian community, and more power to the church.  What  is <br />
not widely realized is that the majority of the persons that were <br />
either burned, drowned, or hung were not witches, but Protestants <br />
within the Christian church.  (The ones that were Protesting  the <br />
Catholic church.)<br />
<br />
I realize that, at this time, this is a rather sketchy  document. <br />
I hope in the near future to be able to take the time to  develop <br />
more  of  the depth that I would like to put into  bring  up  our <br />
roots.  I  hope to include in the expanded edition the  times  of <br />
burning,  modern witchcraft, more symbols, and famous persons  in <br />
the craft.<br />
<br />
We've  changed...but  then as a good friend has told me  on  more <br />
than  one occasion...&quot;When we cease to change, we cease to  grow.  <br />
When we cease to grow, life ends.&quot;<br />

All your suggesting is a 'nice' world, a world where everything is 'right' according to your narrow minded thinking. This syndrom is common. People tend to base very important decisions on things that have no evidence to back them. Basically here is the sum of their thinking------<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no evidence aside from one book that says god exists, so he must exist.&quot;<br />
&quot;It doesnt matter that about 400000 other books say he doesnt exist, he still exists.&quot;<br />
&quot;The fact that there are over 50 other world renowned religeons saying that god as one entity doesnt exist doesnt matter, he still exists.&quot;<br />

Your reasoning is quite outstanding, however and pray tell, in what do you base yourself to denominate the fellow believer as SAD.<br />
<br />
In fact I do find his post quite interesting, educative and enlightning at least from an anthropological point of view.  But please tell us why is this being SAD.  Because I sure do not think so laddy.<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">&quot;Look at the Merlin story...it was a myth, but who knows?&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin wasn't a wizard.  He wasn't english.  Walt Disney never does anything right.<br />
Merlin(Ambrosius Merlinnus) was a Welsh prophet and Military commander who servered under 4 kings(Vortigern, can't remember, Uther Pendragon, and Arthur).   Merlin served under Arthur filling the Roman role(in war) as the &quot;Draconarius&quot;(Dragon-bearer).  Merlin carried the Red Dragon of Wales into the battles.  When the Dragon roared and breathed fire(not really-I believe it was a flag, or pennant of some type), the sky turned red, and the Welsh forces would rally behind Merlin, and charge into the Angle, Saxon, and Jute armies(the germanic invaders who poured into Albion when the Roman forces left to defend Rome itself).   <br />
  Merlin predicted his own death, and he predicted the war(and it's outcome) between the Celtic Welsh/Scots vs. Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.<br />
  He was called a &quot;Wizard&quot; to create anti-sentiment.  The opposition(France) didn't like him-but commoners did.  But they didn't like wizards.  So they called him a wizard.  He wasn't a wizard.  He was a Christian priest.  Christianity came to Albion(Celtic name of England because of the White Cliffs of Dover-Albion means &quot;White&quot;-that's where we get &quot;Albino&quot;) during Roman occupation(which lasted about 500 years).   <br />
  Watching a Disney movie doesn't give you a degree in History.<br />
  And I think you've been watching &quot;The Matrix&quot; a little too much.  &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; doesn't work in this Revolution. Sorry.</div>
