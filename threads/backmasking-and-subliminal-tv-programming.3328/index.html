<br />
<b>Backmasking And Subliminal TV Programming</b><br />
<br />
<br />
A select group of people know they are contributing to the success of creating confusion among the masses of this world in order to conceal their true agenda of which all human beings are a part, willing or unwilling. The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government that is the true ruling power. You are governed, your mind is molded, your tastes formed, your ideas suggested, largely by people you have never met or heard of before. This is the logical result of the way in which society functions today. Vast numbers of human beings must co-operate in this controlled manner if they are to live together in peace and prosperity. Whatever attitude one chooses to take toward this conditioning, it remains a fact that in almost every act of daily life whether in the sphere of politics or business, in your social conduct or your ethical thinking, you are dominated by a relatively small number of people who understand the mental processes and mental patterns of the masses. The real issue or concern is whether or not you are aware of the fact that your freedom has been substituted by mind enslavement. <br />
<br />
<br />
The urgency of your attention this very moment is straightforward. Your mind is being controlled by others and used against you. You are now ready to understand the truth and the madness. It is time for you to wake up and take control before you are physically, emotionally and mentally changed forever. Consumerism has been used as the substance of this new creation while psychology is the essence of deceptive change. The general populous has become consumption and economic slaves of addiction. <br />
<br />
<br />
You are in total control of your mind so let no other human being fill your mind with fear, uncertainty, psychic phenomena or mental waste. There is no battle between good and evil. By allowing your mind to dwell on such polarizing symbolism, you allow yourself to keep participating in the subservient deeds of those you don't even know. The checks and balances of the good and evil model provide the illusion of fear, uncertainty, luck or misfortune in your life. Pass no judgments and these phantasms of deception and control have no basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now look around and see how many minds are infected with addiction and consumption. Look at how the &quot;puppet masters&quot; have raped minds through disbanding, fragmenting, splintering and even destroying knowledge that might have helped many realize their own true being and essence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knowledge has been twisted and used against you to control your freedom. Today's society has become rich in academic twisted knowledge and very poor in awareness and truth. Religion, philosophy and new age spiritual teachings are only a few of the various devices being used to blind you from the truth of who and what you really are. Your own mind is being used against you to consume your true identity and keep you under the watchful control of the &quot;puppet masters&quot; who rule through means of fear, uncertainty, addiction, consumption and twisted knowledge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your mind has been turned into an unfathomable and imperishable ocean of deception. It is your own mind that has become your enemy. It is always the habit of the human mind to be thinking about something, to be always contemplating upon the forms and figures of various persons, places and things. It is your mind that has the cravings and desires and the &quot;puppet masters&quot; know this in great detail. Think of how you have been conditioned into deep thought with the planning and scheming of lusting for wealth, power, and control. It is through your mind that you experience the pleasures of success or the agony of defeat. As a friend, your mind uses its techniques of deception to get you to fulfill its desires. As an enemy, it uses fear to threaten you into fulfilling its cravings. Your mind may lead you astray any way it can, by keeping you from discovering your true identify. This is for the most part, the design of those who would willfully deceive you. Whether you believe it or not, you have been living in someone elses world right up until this very moment. Your mind has been conditioned to accept the puppet masters view of pleasure and your physical senses have been shaped to conform to their will. Your awareness right now is beginning to take back control of your life which has been stolen from you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is your mind in love or attached to any physical object? If so, you have been conditioned. Are desires, cravings, attitudes or opinions clouding your attention? If so, your senses are playing on the desires and cravings created by others. You are being moved about like an emotional rag doll. Now think how long it took you to lose control of yourself. It started with your parents and your grandparents. It was a slow methodical process of programming you out of your own true identity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Modify, impair or change the human brain and you reduce, increase, or modify the mind's ability to function autonomously. Your mind needs you to take charge of your desires and cravings. To do this you have to attach your mind to the greatest thought that exists. The thought of your own unique identity, inner peace, and freedom.<br />
<br />
<br />
Need more proof. The reconstruction of your consciousness into this automaton thing is being executed in such a manner that it goes virtually undetected; in fact you are doing it to yourself and don't even know it. Why with the proper incentive, you're doing it to yourself and just love it - look at all the &quot;stuff&quot; you have. You're so comfortable you have become passive, submissive, and you don't even have to think. You just go with the flow. It feels good and quite natural running on automatic. However, disrupt your automatic mental state with even the simplest of problems - like misplacing your keys or wallet - and life becomes a living hell in your mind until you find those keys or wallet to re-establish your habitual routine. This becomes true of any little problem in life. You want it resolved as fast as possible, to stop the mental frustration, torment and confusion. You have become so addicted to living life under the control of others that even small annoyances become stressful events in your life.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are constantly being fed images, sounds and information to keep your mind habitually thinking and speculating upon matters that have little or nothing to do with your life. This keeps you self-programming your mind to react and respond in specific ways to various stimuli when presented. For example, your television is literally programming you. The negative factor associated with the news is the same stress factor that causes changes in your mental and emotional thinking patterns which cause physical changes to your body; sickness, disease, and possibly premature death. Why you even carry the news with you wherever you go, stressing everyone out with it. You argue with others about it, even fight physically about these opinions that were given to you. After only a few years of the news, the stress and this unnatural human interaction, have made you addicted to living someone elses life. You even start things going with those you know will argue and fight with you over a trivial matter. You get your mental and emotional fix in this way. Emotional, drug like habits are being developed in you to generate abnormal states of depression, loneliness, and many other unusual and unnatural states of mind. Through repetition, your mind quickly identifies itself with certain unnatural, emotional, and mental states of consciousness as being normal. A few years ago you would have viewed this as abnormal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your emotions are being used against you to lead directly to the habituation and subsequent automation of your mind. Your emotions are being developed to rule over your intellect because as a determinant, the emotions offer greater subjective identification to unnatural stimuli. A few uncontrolled people see this form of mind manipulation being used to lead the masses towards war. While the reason for war always appears to be developed around intellectual reasoning, the real rallying points pivot around the long term, deep rooted feelings that have been cultivated in your minds over many years.<br />
<br />
<br />
People are medicated so heavily with emotional stimuli, that very few can ever accomplish anything in life. While you imagine, think about, and consider all sorts of things you would like to do in life, you never seem to be able to make your dreams come true. As the years roll by, your mind becomes habituated and addicted to living life in an emotional failure mode. When it comes to making the proper choices and getting things done, your mind continues to worry and speculate upon all sorts of obstacles that prevent you from taking any action towards manifesting your dreams.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are under the influence of, and listening to, the &quot;puppet masters&quot; as they dictate to your mind and its emotions. You are being controlled. Your life is becoming more and more illusionary, lacking less and less in the substance of experience. The computer, the Internet, and virtual reality are quickly habituating many minds into automatons, to function like robots, in the labs and slave factories of society.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have lost consciousness of who you really are. You are a prisoner in your own mind. You are being held hostage by the invisible strings of others you do not even know. In fact, these small groups of people want you to stop reading any further, right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion</b><br />
<br />
<br />
You must learn how to &quot;switch off&quot; these preconceived ideas and open your mind, if only for a few moments at a time to see what is being communicated to you. You must learn how to &quot;switch off&quot; or temporarily ignore the subtle programming and imagery being used to control you, if you are ever going to realize your true identity. Whether you believe these things or not, our shared destiny has been realized, and the choice is now yours.<br />

			"articleBody": "I agree with the following, Do you?\n\nBackmasking And Subliminal TV Programming\n\n\nA select group of people know they are contributing to the success of creating confusion among the masses of this world in order to conceal their true agenda of which all human beings are a part, willing or unwilling. The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government that is the true ruling power. You are governed, your mind is molded, your tastes formed, your ideas suggested, largely by people you have never met or heard of before. This is the logical result of the way in which society functions today. Vast numbers of human beings must co-operate in this controlled manner if they are to live together in peace and prosperity. Whatever attitude one chooses to take toward this conditioning, it remains a fact that in almost every act of daily life whether in the sphere of politics or business, in your social conduct or your ethical thinking, you are dominated by a relatively small number of people who understand the mental processes and mental patterns of the masses. The real issue or concern is whether or not you are aware of the fact that your freedom has been substituted by mind enslavement. \n\n\nThe urgency of your attention this very moment is straightforward. Your mind is being controlled by others and used against you. You are now ready to understand the truth and the madness. It is time for you to wake up and take control before you are physically, emotionally and mentally changed forever. Consumerism has been used as the substance of this new creation while psychology is the essence of deceptive change. The general populous has become consumption and economic slaves of addiction. \n\n\nYou are in total control of your mind so let no other human being fill your mind with fear, uncertainty, psychic phenomena or mental waste. There is no battle between good and evil. By allowing your mind to dwell on such polarizing symbolism, you allow yourself to keep participating in the subservient deeds of those you don't even know. The checks and balances of the good and evil model provide the illusion of fear, uncertainty, luck or misfortune in your life. Pass no judgments and these phantasms of deception and control have no basis.\n\n\nNow look around and see how many minds are infected with addiction and consumption. Look at how the \"puppet masters\" have raped minds through disbanding, fragmenting, splintering and even destroying knowledge that might have helped many realize their own true being and essence.\n\n\nKnowledge has been twisted and used against you to control your freedom. Today's society has become rich in academic twisted knowledge and very poor in awareness and truth. Religion, philosophy and new age spiritual teachings are only a few of the various devices being used to blind you from the truth of who and what you really are. Your own mind is being used against you to consume your true identity and keep you under the watchful control of the \"puppet masters\" who rule through means of fear, uncertainty, addiction, consumption and twisted knowledge.\n\n\nYour mind has been turned into an unfathomable and imperishable ocean of deception. It is your own mind that has become your enemy. It is always the habit of the human mind to be thinking about something, to be always contemplating upon the forms and figures of various persons, places and things. It is your mind that has the cravings and desires and the \"puppet masters\" know this in great detail. Think of how you have been conditioned into deep thought with the planning and scheming of lusting for wealth, power, and control. It is through your mind that you experience the pleasures of success or the agony of defeat. As a friend, your mind uses its techniques of deception to get you to fulfill its desires. As an enemy, it uses fear to threaten you into fulfilling its cravings. Your mind may lead you astray any way it can, by keeping you from discovering your true identify. This is for the most part, the design of those who would willfully deceive you. Whether you believe it or not, you have been living in someone elses world right up until this very moment. Your mind has been conditioned to accept the puppet masters view of pleasure and your physical senses have been shaped to conform to their will. Your awareness right now is beginning to take back control of your life which has been stolen from you.\n\n\nIs your mind in love or attached to any physical object? If so, you have been conditioned. Are desires, cravings, attitudes or opinions clouding your attention? If so, your senses are playing on the desires and cravings created by others. You are being moved about like an emotional rag doll. Now think how long it took you to lose control of yourself. It started with your parents and your grandparents. It was a slow methodical process of programming you out of your own true identity.\n\n\nModify, impair or change the human brain and you reduce, increase, or modify the mind's ability to function autonomously. Your mind needs you to take charge of your desires and cravings. To do this you have to attach your mind to the greatest thought that exists. The thought of your own unique identity, inner peace, and freedom.\n\n\nNeed more proof. The reconstruction of your consciousness into this automaton thing is being executed in such a manner that it goes virtually undetected; in fact you are doing it to yourself and don't even know it. Why with the proper incentive, you're doing it to yourself and just love it - look at all the \"stuff\" you have. You're so comfortable you have become passive, submissive, and you don't even have to think. You just go with the flow. It feels good and quite natural running on automatic. However, disrupt your automatic mental state with even the simplest of problems - like misplacing your keys or wallet - and life becomes a living hell in your mind until you find those keys or wallet to re-establish your habitual routine. This becomes true of any little problem in life. You want it resolved as fast as possible, to stop the mental frustration, torment and confusion. You have become so addicted to living life under the control of others that even small annoyances become stressful events in your life.\n\n\nYou are constantly being fed images, sounds and information to keep your mind habitually thinking and speculating upon matters that have little or nothing to do with your life. This keeps you self-programming your mind to react and respond in specific ways to various stimuli when presented. For example, your television is literally programming you. The negative factor associated with the news is the same stress factor that causes changes in your mental and emotional thinking patterns which cause physical changes to your body; sickness, disease, and possibly premature death. Why you even carry the news with you wherever you go, stressing everyone out with it. You argue with others about it, even fight physically about these opinions that were given to you. After only a few years of the news, the stress and this unnatural human interaction, have made you addicted to living someone elses life. You even start things going with those you know will argue and fight with you over a trivial matter. You get your mental and emotional fix in this way. Emotional, drug like habits are being developed in you to generate abnormal states of depression, loneliness, and many other unusual and unnatural states of mind. Through repetition, your mind quickly identifies itself with certain unnatural, emotional, and mental states of consciousness as being normal. A few years ago you would have viewed this as abnormal.\n\n\nYour emotions are being used against you to lead directly to the habituation and subsequent automation of your mind. Your emotions are being developed to rule over your intellect because as a determinant, the emotions offer greater subjective identification to unnatural stimuli. A few uncontrolled people see this form of mind manipulation being used to lead the masses towards war. While the reason for war always appears to be developed around intellectual reasoning, the real rallying points pivot around the long term, deep rooted feelings that have been cultivated in your minds over many years.\n\n\nPeople are medicated so heavily with emotional stimuli, that very few can ever accomplish anything in life. While you imagine, think about, and consider all sorts of things you would like to do in life, you never seem to be able to make your dreams come true. As the years roll by, your mind becomes habituated and addicted to living life in an emotional failure mode. When it comes to making the proper choices and getting things done, your mind continues to worry and speculate upon all sorts of obstacles that prevent you from taking any action towards manifesting your dreams.\n\n\nYou are under the influence of, and listening to, the \"puppet masters\" as they dictate to your mind and its emotions. You are being controlled. Your life is becoming more and more illusionary, lacking less and less in the substance of experience. The computer, the Internet, and virtual reality are quickly habituating many minds into automatons, to function like robots, in the labs and slave factories of society.\n\n\nYou have lost consciousness of who you really are. You are a prisoner in your own mind. You are being held hostage by the invisible strings of others you do not even know. In fact, these small groups of people want you to stop reading any further, right now.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nYou must learn how to \"switch off\" these preconceived ideas and open your mind, if only for a few moments at a time to see what is being communicated to you. You must learn how to \"switch off\" or temporarily ignore the subtle programming and imagery being used to control you, if you are ever going to realize your true identity. Whether you believe these things or not, our shared destiny has been realized, and the choice is now yours.\n\nFrom:\nhttp:\/\/www.geocities.com\/aliensworldview\/index.html",
