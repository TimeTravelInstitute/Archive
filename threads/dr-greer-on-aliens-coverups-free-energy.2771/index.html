 <br />
by Richard M. Dolan<br />
Phenomena Magazine<br />
September 10, 2004<br />
<br />
Earlier in 2004, Phenomena Editor Richard Dolan interviewed Dr.<br />
Steven Greer.<br />
<br />
Greer is the founder of the Center for [the] Study of<br />
Extraterrestrial intelligence (CSETI), which claimes to have<br />
initiated communication and contact with extraterrestrials on Earth.<br />
<br />
In addition, Greer has founded the Disclosure Project, dedicated to<br />
ending official secrecy regarding UFOs.<br />
<br />
Dolan (D): In 1990, you formed the Center for the Study of<br />
Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI),and within three years you're<br />
getting an invitation to meet with Laurence Rockefeller. How did that<br />
happen so quickly?<br />
<br />
Greer (G): To be honest with you, I think it was the force of the<br />
message. Not only had we put together an enormous amount of<br />
documentation about the phenomenon, but we had also formulated teams<br />
that were going all over the world, and had reproducible results with<br />
hundreds of witnesses - who had been able to signal to these objects.<br />
We had different teams in England, or Belgium, or Mexico, or places<br />
in the United States. From a number of them we got videotapes,<br />
photographs, or other witnesses who saw the event happening.<br />
<br />
D: Some of the stories are extraordinary.<br />
<br />
G: Yes, and they're all absolutely true. In fact they're way<br />
understated. This is what caught the attention of people like<br />
Laurence Rockefeller, Mrs. Buttros Ghali [wife of the former UN<br />
General Secretary], former head of Army Intelligence General<br />
Stubblebine, and eventually friends of the President [Clinton]. Some<br />
very good friends of the President became cognizant of what we were<br />
doing and urgently wanted us to get information to the President, to<br />
his science advisor, as well as to some of the senior military<br />
intelligence people in his administration after he got elected in<br />
1993.<br />
<br />
So we put together briefing materials and had meetings. The main<br />
thing is that this is an inside game. I hate to use that term, but<br />
this has mainly been a process of educating two classes of people who<br />
are &quot;insiders.&quot;<br />
<br />
One are the people who are on the inside, who should know, but don't,<br />
such as Presidents, CIA directors, and so on. The other part of it is<br />
educating, from a new paradigm, the national and international<br />
security control group - which some call MJ-12 - that deals with<br />
these issues. That is a committee of about two or three hundred<br />
people, and I know a number of them.<br />
<br />
The issue here is to educate them to the need for disclosure, for<br />
safe applications of technologies, and for this matter to be handled<br />
wisely. We feel that it has been handled promiscuously and<br />
dangerously. If you look at some of the things that have happened<br />
over the last fifty years, aside from it eroding the rule of law and<br />
democracy, the actual handling of the subject itself has been<br />
dangerous.<br />
<br />
It's a very dangerous thing for example, for the Commander in Chief<br />
of Atlantic Command, Admiral Harry Trane, not to have had adequate<br />
information on the subject and to scramble jets up and down the<br />
eastern seaboard trying to force down one of these objects. [This<br />
refers to an alleged military-UFO encounter from May 1981 - Ed.].<br />
This kind of behavior, which has mainly taken place in a vacuum of<br />
secrecy, is a danger to the national security.<br />
<br />
You have people who have a need to know who can't find out anything.<br />
And then you have other people who do know and are controlling it,<br />
but they're in a cult of secrecy that becomes hermetically sealed.<br />
<br />
D: You briefed CIA director Woolsey, and there's talk that you<br />
briefed some other very high-level Clinton officials. I'm wondering<br />
who those were. For example, the name Al Gore came up. Did you in<br />
fact brief Al Gore on UFOs?<br />
<br />
G: Well, there are a number of people in public life that I don't<br />
want to comment on, who we are currently meeting with. They are and<br />
extensive group of people. They include people who are currently<br />
friends with every living president. There's not a living president<br />
who doesn't have a close associate on our advisory team. So from<br />
that, you can extrapolate.<br />
<br />
D: Can you give a sense of when these briefings were happening, the<br />
kinds of things what were said? What do you think of Bill Clinton<br />
himself, and his sense of all this?<br />
<br />
G: First of all, for the most part, very few people in most<br />
administrations knew anything about the subject. They knew what they<br />
saw on a badly-done documentary on the Discovery Channel. It's a sad<br />
statement, but that is really true.<br />
<br />
This is not just the executive branch. I met with a member of the<br />
intelligence community back in the 1990's. That was Senator Richard<br />
Bryan, and it was traumatic. I use that word because there's this<br />
sense that [these officials] know this is the truth. But the problem<br />
is that if you make the case this is real, and you're talking to<br />
someone who is the head of the CIA, or is a high official in the<br />
intelligence community, you find they have been denied access.<br />
They've made an inquiry through channels and have been told no such<br />
project exists.<br />
<br />
This is frightening. Not in the sense that the phenomenon is is<br />
frightening, but that people could be at those levels of<br />
responsibility and operational divisions where they really do have a<br />
need to know, and where they are completely left in the dark. I would<br />
say that none of the reactions have been, &quot;oh this is silly, it's<br />
nonsense.&quot; This is important to hear: I haven't had a single meeting<br />
with a high official, either scientific, political, or military, who<br />
has had that reaction. Not in the least.<br />
<br />
D: What were some of the other types of reactions?<br />
<br />
G: Dismay, deep concern, and great interest.<br />
<br />
D: Would you say they generally believe there's some kind of cover up<br />
going on?<br />
<br />
G: Oh yeah. I had with a member of congress who is on the House<br />
National Security Committee who said to me, bluntly: &quot;We of course<br />
are window dressing.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll never forget the poignant moment when we were finishing the<br />
nearly three-hour meeting with CIA Director [James] Woolsey and his<br />
wife, Dr. Sue Woolsey (who at the time was the Chief Operating<br />
Officer at the National Academy of Sciences). He was getting ready to<br />
leave, Secret Service were out front, and I gave him a summary packet<br />
with a set of recommendations for the Clinton Administration. This<br />
was in the December of 1993. He looked at me and said, &quot;Dr. Greer,<br />
how can we disclose what we are being denied access to? What would<br />
that say to the world?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a very sobering thought, because part of the illusion here is<br />
that people we elect are actually in control. They're not. This is<br />
something that most people don't discuss. These [government<br />
officials] are not stupid or naive. Clinton was a very bright man.<br />
Cohen was a very brilliant man. Woolsey was a very smart man. They<br />
know there's something going on.<br />
<br />
When we did our first briefing for members of Congress in 1997, we<br />
gathered about a dozen military witnesses of UFO events. Following<br />
that, I had a meeting over at the Pentagon with a senior official, an<br />
admiral at the Joint Chiefs of Staff level. My military advisor, a<br />
man with great access to the senior flag officers, was a friend of<br />
this gentleman. We went over there with a couple of these witnesses.<br />
<br />
Prior to the meeting, I had given him some documents, code names, and<br />
numbers. These were current code names and code numbers. He took them<br />
and made inquiries at the Pentagon into these projects, and he hit<br />
pay dirt. He actually located these projects. When he made an<br />
inquiry, wanting to know what these projects were doing, he was flat<br />
out told, &quot;Sir, you don't have a need to know.&quot; This is an admiral<br />
with the Intelligence Director. They told him he didn't have a need<br />
to know. He was furious.<br />
<br />
D: These are the code words for UFO related programs?<br />
<br />
G: Yes. They're actually ETV, extraterrestrial vehicle, related. No<br />
one uses the word UFO, by the way. UFO was coined after they knew<br />
they weren't unidentified and they knew they didn't fly. (Laughs).<br />
<br />
By the end of this briefing, this admiral said to me, &quot;If this is<br />
true, and I have no reason to doubt it, you're dealing with some of<br />
the most powerful technologies. These are things that could do<br />
circles around my B-2 stealth bombers.&quot; He also said, &quot;Unless the<br />
civilian authorities authorize me to push further, there's not much I<br />
can do.&quot; I then told him what we were planning to do with the<br />
Disclosure Project. To the extent that we could get people and<br />
documents and other things, we were going to put them out there. He<br />
looked at me and said, &quot;If you can do it, do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was in Britain meeting with the Ministry of Defence, and also the<br />
former head of the Ministry of Defence, Lord Hill Norton. He's a Sea<br />
Lord, a Five Star Admiral. At one point he asked, &quot;Why the hell<br />
wasn't I told about this when I was head of the Ministry of Defence?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said &quot;Sir, what would you have done while you were head of the MoD,<br />
and you found out that there was a clandestine group that was<br />
transnational - e.g. transcended national borders - that had this<br />
information. That had lied to the Presidents, Prime Ministers, and<br />
high officials. that had used hundreds of billions of taxpayer<br />
dollars to work on thies projects, and had sequestered them inside<br />
private corporate structures. And had also, literally, engaged in<br />
elimination - murder - in order to keep it secret?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at me and said, &quot;I wouldn't have stood for it for one<br />
bloody minute!&quot; I said, &quot;That's why they weren't going to tell you,<br />
and that's why they will never tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You see, the first thing these folks do is a soul biopsy. By that I<br />
mean they're going to take a reading of you as a person. Your whole<br />
person. If they don't think you'll go along with the game, they're<br />
not going to tell you. Or they'll tell you disinformation, or set you<br />
on the wrong track.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you know has nothing to do with your position. This is<br />
the big mistake that the UFO research community has made. Assumptions<br />
have been make, [like] &quot;oh, you're the head of the National Security<br />
Agency, you know.&quot; Some NSA chiefs have known, some haven't. [Former<br />
NSA Director] Bobby Ray Inman knew. Others haven't. Some CIA<br />
directors had knowledge, others didn't. Bill Colby knew a great deal.<br />
<br />
D: Is that why Bill Colby died?<br />
<br />
G: Yeah, basically, I mean that's an untouched story.<br />
<br />
D: He died in 1996, in what was described as an 'unfortunate boating<br />
accident...<br />

			"articleBody": "by Richard M. Dolan\nPhenomena Magazine\nSeptember 10, 2004\n\nEarlier in 2004, Phenomena Editor Richard Dolan interviewed Dr.\nSteven Greer.\n\nGreer is the founder of the Center for [the] Study of\nExtraterrestrial intelligence (CSETI), which claimes to have\ninitiated communication and contact with extraterrestrials on Earth.\n\nIn addition, Greer has founded the Disclosure Project, dedicated to\nending official secrecy regarding UFOs.\n\nDolan (D): In 1990, you formed the Center for the Study of\nExtraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI),and within three years you're\ngetting an invitation to meet with Laurence Rockefeller. How did that\nhappen so quickly?\n\nGreer (G): To be honest with you, I think it was the force of the\nmessage. Not only had we put together an enormous amount of\ndocumentation about the phenomenon, but we had also formulated teams\nthat were going all over the world, and had reproducible results with\nhundreds of witnesses - who had been able to signal to these objects.\nWe had different teams in England, or Belgium, or Mexico, or places\nin the United States. From a number of them we got videotapes,\nphotographs, or other witnesses who saw the event happening.\n\nD: Some of the stories are extraordinary.\n\nG: Yes, and they're all absolutely true. In fact they're way\nunderstated. This is what caught the attention of people like\nLaurence Rockefeller, Mrs. Buttros Ghali [wife of the former UN\nGeneral Secretary], former head of Army Intelligence General\nStubblebine, and eventually friends of the President [Clinton]. Some\nvery good friends of the President became cognizant of what we were\ndoing and urgently wanted us to get information to the President, to\nhis science advisor, as well as to some of the senior military\nintelligence people in his administration after he got elected in\n1993.\n\nSo we put together briefing materials and had meetings. The main\nthing is that this is an inside game. I hate to use that term, but\nthis has mainly been a process of educating two classes of people who\nare \"insiders.\"\n\nOne are the people who are on the inside, who should know, but don't,\nsuch as Presidents, CIA directors, and so on. The other part of it is\neducating, from a new paradigm, the national and international\nsecurity control group - which some call MJ-12 - that deals with\nthese issues. That is a committee of about two or three hundred\npeople, and I know a number of them.\n\nThe issue here is to educate them to the need for disclosure, for\nsafe applications of technologies, and for this matter to be handled\nwisely. We feel that it has been handled promiscuously and\ndangerously. If you look at some of the things that have happened\nover the last fifty years, aside from it eroding the rule of law and\ndemocracy, the actual handling of the subject itself has been\ndangerous.\n\nIt's a very dangerous thing for example, for the Commander in Chief\nof Atlantic Command, Admiral Harry Trane, not to have had adequate\ninformation on the subject and to scramble jets up and down the\neastern seaboard trying to force down one of these objects. [This\nrefers to an alleged military-UFO encounter from May 1981 - Ed.].\nThis kind of behavior, which has mainly taken place in a vacuum of\nsecrecy, is a danger to the national security.\n\nYou have people who have a need to know who can't find out anything.\nAnd then you have other people who do know and are controlling it,\nbut they're in a cult of secrecy that becomes hermetically sealed.\n\nD: You briefed CIA director Woolsey, and there's talk that you\nbriefed some other very high-level Clinton officials. I'm wondering\nwho those were. For example, the name Al Gore came up. Did you in\nfact brief Al Gore on UFOs?\n\nG: Well, there are a number of people in public life that I don't\nwant to comment on, who we are currently meeting with. They are and\nextensive group of people. They include people who are currently\nfriends with every living president. There's not a living president\nwho doesn't have a close associate on our advisory team. So from\nthat, you can extrapolate.\n\nD: Can you give a sense of when these briefings were happening, the\nkinds of things what were said? What do you think of Bill Clinton\nhimself, and his sense of all this?\n\nG: First of all, for the most part, very few people in most\nadministrations knew anything about the subject. They knew what they\nsaw on a badly-done documentary on the Discovery Channel. It's a sad\nstatement, but that is really true.\n\nThis is not just the executive branch. I met with a member of the\nintelligence community back in the 1990's. That was Senator Richard\nBryan, and it was traumatic. I use that word because there's this\nsense that [these officials] know this is the truth. But the problem\nis that if you make the case this is real, and you're talking to\nsomeone who is the head of the CIA, or is a high official in the\nintelligence community, you find they have been denied access.\nThey've made an inquiry through channels and have been told no such\nproject exists.\n\nThis is frightening. Not in the sense that the phenomenon is is\nfrightening, but that people could be at those levels of\nresponsibility and operational divisions where they really do have a\nneed to know, and where they are completely left in the dark. I would\nsay that none of the reactions have been, \"oh this is silly, it's\nnonsense.\" This is important to hear: I haven't had a single meeting\nwith a high official, either scientific, political, or military, who\nhas had that reaction. Not in the least.\n\nD: What were some of the other types of reactions?\n\nG: Dismay, deep concern, and great interest.\n\nD: Would you say they generally believe there's some kind of cover up\ngoing on?\n\nG: Oh yeah. I had with a member of congress who is on the House\nNational Security Committee who said to me, bluntly: \"We of course\nare window dressing.\"\n\nI'll never forget the poignant moment when we were finishing the\nnearly three-hour meeting with CIA Director [James] Woolsey and his\nwife, Dr. Sue Woolsey (who at the time was the Chief Operating\nOfficer at the National Academy of Sciences). He was getting ready to\nleave, Secret Service were out front, and I gave him a summary packet\nwith a set of recommendations for the Clinton Administration. This\nwas in the December of 1993. He looked at me and said, \"Dr. Greer,\nhow can we disclose what we are being denied access to? What would\nthat say to the world?\"\n\nIt's a very sobering thought, because part of the illusion here is\nthat people we elect are actually in control. They're not. This is\nsomething that most people don't discuss. These [government\nofficials] are not stupid or naive. Clinton was a very bright man.\nCohen was a very brilliant man. Woolsey was a very smart man. They\nknow there's something going on.\n\nWhen we did our first briefing for members of Congress in 1997, we\ngathered about a dozen military witnesses of UFO events. Following\nthat, I had a meeting over at the Pentagon with a senior official, an\nadmiral at the Joint Chiefs of Staff level. My military advisor, a\nman with great access to the senior flag officers, was a friend of\nthis gentleman. We went over there with a couple of these witnesses.\n\nPrior to the meeting, I had given him some documents, code names, and\nnumbers. These were current code names and code numbers. He took them\nand made inquiries at the Pentagon into these projects, and he hit\npay dirt. He actually located these projects. When he made an\ninquiry, wanting to know what these projects were doing, he was flat\nout told, \"Sir, you don't have a need to know.\" This is an admiral\nwith the Intelligence Director. They told him he didn't have a need\nto know. He was furious.\n\nD: These are the code words for UFO related programs?\n\nG: Yes. They're actually ETV, extraterrestrial vehicle, related. No\none uses the word UFO, by the way. UFO was coined after they knew\nthey weren't unidentified and they knew they didn't fly. (Laughs).\n\nBy the end of this briefing, this admiral said to me, \"If this is\ntrue, and I have no reason to doubt it, you're dealing with some of\nthe most powerful technologies. These are things that could do\ncircles around my B-2 stealth bombers.\" He also said, \"Unless the\ncivilian authorities authorize me to push further, there's not much I\ncan do.\" I then told him what we were planning to do with the\nDisclosure Project. To the extent that we could get people and\ndocuments and other things, we were going to put them out there. He\nlooked at me and said, \"If you can do it, do it.\"\n\nI was in Britain meeting with the Ministry of Defence, and also the\nformer head of the Ministry of Defence, Lord Hill Norton. He's a Sea\nLord, a Five Star Admiral. At one point he asked, \"Why the hell\nwasn't I told about this when I was head of the Ministry of Defence?\"\n\nI said \"Sir, what would you have done while you were head of the MoD,\nand you found out that there was a clandestine group that was\ntransnational - e.g. transcended national borders - that had this\ninformation. That had lied to the Presidents, Prime Ministers, and\nhigh officials. that had used hundreds of billions of taxpayer\ndollars to work on thies projects, and had sequestered them inside\nprivate corporate structures. And had also, literally, engaged in\nelimination - murder - in order to keep it secret?\"\n\nHe looked at me and said, \"I wouldn't have stood for it for one\nbloody minute!\" I said, \"That's why they weren't going to tell you,\nand that's why they will never tell you.\"\n\nYou see, the first thing these folks do is a soul biopsy. By that I\nmean they're going to take a reading of you as a person. Your whole\nperson. If they don't think you'll go along with the game, they're\nnot going to tell you. Or they'll tell you disinformation, or set you\non the wrong track.\n\nWhether or not you know has nothing to do with your position. This is\nthe big mistake that the UFO research community has made. Assumptions\nhave been make, [like] \"oh, you're the head of the National Security\nAgency, you know.\" Some NSA chiefs have known, some haven't. [Former\nNSA Director] Bobby Ray Inman knew. Others haven't. Some CIA\ndirectors had knowledge, others didn't. Bill Colby knew a great deal.\n\nD: Is that why Bill Colby died?\n\nG: Yeah, basically, I mean that's an untouched story.\n\nD: He died in 1996, in what was described as an 'unfortunate boating\naccident...\n\nMore- http:\/\/disclosureproject.org\n\n*[Phenomena Magazine SGInterview Sept.10\/04]*",
