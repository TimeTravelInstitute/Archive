								<div class="bbWrapper">THE DOGONS AND THE SIRIUS LORE<br />
<br />
The information given here of the esoteric knowledge of the Dogons was given to French anthropologists by four priests and priestesses of the Dogon Tribe of Mali in Africa who claimed they had only a &quot;slight acquaintance&quot; with this extremely secret body of knowledge. These revelations represent only one phase of a level of the teaching permitted to ranking initiates, of which there are four graduated levels of initiation. <br />
<br />
1. Giri so or word at face value: the lowest level consisting of simple explanations involving mythical characters, often disguised, their adventures simplified and not linked together. &quot;It had to do with invisible deeds concerning the ordinary rituals and materials;&quot; Cf. Greek section on mythology of gods and heroes - Sirius Mystery, R. Temple.<br />
<br />
2. Benue so, or word on the side, includes giri so but also a thorough study of certain parts of rites and representations. Their coordination only appears within the great divisions of learning which are not completely revealed.<br />
<br />
3. Bolo so or word from behind, completes the preceding learning and furnishes the syntheses that apply to a vaster whole, but does not include instruction in the truly secret parts of the tradition.<br />
<br />
4. So dayi or clear word, which concerns the edifice of knowledge and its complexity. Note that so dayi sounds like the Sod Ihoh of the Hebrews (see note at end of Dogon section).<br />
<br />
The Dogons do not claim to have been visited by extraterrestrial fish men or &quot;Nommo&quot; as they call them. They make no such claims. They learned the following from their forefathers. Ethnologists say the Dogons are the cultural and biological descendents of &quot;ancient Greeks&quot; from the Isle of Lemnos in the Aegean Sea. (These are Turkic-Turanian peoples: Reading of the Lemnos Island Inscription, By Polat Kaya, M. Sc. E. E.). The Lemnians themselves claimed descent from the fifty Argonauts of Jason in Greek legend who, according to the legend, went to Libya, migrated westward as the Garamantians, were driven south and eventually reached the River Niger in Mali after many centuries to interbreed with the natives and teach them. We will see later that the legend of the Nommo existed throughout the ancient Mediterranean and Near-Eastern world. It is very common for teaching or doctrine to survive in a relatively pure form unchanged after many centuries once it has been transmitted to an isolated, backward people. <br />
<br />
Temple's original research connects what the Dogons believe, as learned from the Lemnians, back to the people the Lemnians learned it from: Egyptians, Babylonians, Sumerians. This tradition he calls the &quot;Sirius Mystery.&quot; This tradition is sometimes also referred to as the Great Tradition, Secret Doctrine, Cult of Isis, though this results in much confusion because &quot;Secret Doctrine/Great Tradition&quot; often refers to the Void Doctrine (Dark Tradition) while the Cult of Isis refers, or should refer, more specifically to the Sirius lore. This will be dealt with later, when the focus is on Egypt, Babylonia and Sumeria. There one will see two different traditions linked together for the deepest initiates, as well as a usurpation of the Sirius cult of Isis by a Cult of Astarte, which superceded it, submerging and erasing it as much as possible.<br />
<br />
The Dogons possess the Sirius Mystery in a rather pure form, separated from any void/dark tradition knowledge or other esoteric traditions such as the Cult of Astarte (e.g., of the Hebrews). <br />
<br />
Note that Temple of not an occultist. For his own research in writing the Sirius Mystery, he won a prestigious fellowship in the Royal Astronomical Society of London. He won this because the Dogons, in revealing their knowledge of the Nommo to French anthropologists, revealed also very advanced astronomical knowledge, some of it not yet equaled by modern radio and mathematical astronomy! <br />
<br />
The Dogons say:<br />
<br />
1. The star Sirius (known to the Dogons as &quot;Sigi tolo&quot; or &quot;Yasigi tolo.&quot; &quot;Tolo&quot; means star; they mean &quot;Star of Sigui and Star of Yasigui&quot;) has an invisible (to the unaided eye) companion star (known to modern astronomers as Sirius B). The Dogons say this star orbits Sirius A in an egg shaped or elliptical orbit with Sirius A at one focus of the ellipse. The orbit, they say, takes about 50 years for one circuit. This has all been confirmed by modern radio astronomy.<br />
<br />
2. The Star Sirius B revolves on its own axis in about one year's time. Modern astronomical equipment can not (at the time this was written up) observe such detail!<br />
<br />
3. The material of Sirius B is super dense &quot;star metal&quot; vastly heavier than anything found on earth. They call it &quot;sagala.&quot; Modern calculations have confirmed this!<br />
<br />
4. There is a third star in the Sirius system they call &quot;Emma ya&quot; (see CM section) four times as light in weight as Sirius B, traveling along a greater orbit around Sirius A but in the same direction as Sirius B, also taking 50 years to complete one orbit. Emma ya moves 90 degrees behind Sirius B as it orbits. The existence of a Sirius C or third Sirius companion is controversial among modern astronomical observers. Dogons say Sirius C is bigger than Sirius B. <br />
<br />
5. The Nommo came from the Sirius system.<br />
<br />
6. Saturn has invisible (to the unaided eye) rings and Jupiter has four great moons, likewise invisible (to the unaided eye).<br />
<br />
7. The planets orbit the sun, as does the earth, and the earth rotates on its own axis fixing day and year length.<br />
<br />
8. The sun distributed light in space and on the earth with its rays.<br />
<br />
9. The Milky Way (our galaxy) contains all the visible stars and the earth and sun are part of this system or world of spiraling stars. The Dogons say an infinite number of such spiraling worlds exist. These worlds are populated by many creatures such as men with tails or men with wings. The moon, however, they flatly say is dry and dead. <br />
<br />
The Dogon also know things an enlightened person of knowledge, ancient Greek or Lemnian might have known, e.g., that the red blood circulates in the body and the essence of nourishment passes into the red blood after the body changes food and beverage.<br />
<br />
The Dogon priests have a subtle concept of matter. They say the universe is based on two principles; one a principle of the vibrations of matter, the other a principle of the general movement of the universe as a whole. The original germ of life is symbolized by the smallest cultivated seed. This seed, quickened by internal vibrations, bursts the enveloping sheath and emerges to reach the uttermost confines of the universe. Note: Christ, in explaining the Kingdom of God, compared it to a mustard seed, a tiny cultivated seed, which grows into a tree (see Christian section). At the same time this unfolding matter moves along a path which forms a spiral or helix. Two fundamental notions are thus expressed: on the one hand the perpetual helical movement signifies the conservation of matter; further, this movement is held to represent the perpetual alteration of opposites, right and left, high and low, odd and even, male and female, reflecting a principle of twinness which ideally should direct the proliferation of life. These pairs of opposites support each other in an equilibrium which the individual being conserves within himself. On the other hand, the infinite extension of the universe is expressed by the continual progression of matter along this spiral path. <br />
<br />
Note that the aforesaid implies the possibility of individuals not having the equilibrium conserved in themselves. These beings would be partial beings or sub-humans and in this way unlike the universe as a whole. (Cf St. Paul's comments on his own body, in Christian section.)<br />
<br />
Such ideas as these existed in ancient Greece. These astronomical, scientific and philosophical ideas are, to the Dogon priests, subsidiary to their main body of knowledge, the knowledge of the Nommo to which they attach the supreme importance. It is as follows:<br />
<br />
Our solar system belongs to Ogo, but Sirius and its system belongs to Nommo. Nommos came to earth, amphibious fish-men, founding culture and civilization, teaching men astronomy, time keeping, agriculture, all arts and sciences. Sirius is called the &quot;land of the fish.&quot; The matter in the Sirius system is called &quot;pure earth&quot; but in our solar system it is called &quot;impure earth.&quot; The landing of the Nommo on earth is called the &quot;day of the fish.&quot; The earth itself is envisioned as the center of Ogo's activity in this sun or solar system, where Ogo plugged into our system of planets. Ogo used our solar system as a placenta to give birth. Ogo is humans, cosmically impure, evolved here, the imperfect, the outcasts, the meddlers. Ogo rebelled at his own creation and remained unfinished or incomplete. In order to atone for our impurity, the Dogons say the Nommo dies and is resurrected, acting as a sacrifice for us, to cleanse and purify the earth. Nommo is crucified on a tree and forms a eucharistic meal for humanity and is then resurrected. So while humans are cosmic pariahs as is Ogo, there is hope to the Dogons, hope of redemption, not from some sort of sin or some sort of rules infraction, but more from a form of impurity such as Ogo represents. The Dogons say Nommo will return. A certain star will appear in the sky once more as a testament to Nommo's resurrection. When Nommo originally landed on earth he crushed Ogo, thus marking Nommo's future domination over the earth, which Ogo had had prior to this. Mankind is envisioned as a mixture in which Nommo and Ogo battle and struggle. The Dogons are not talking about a spiritual thing here. They are saying that our FLESH is of Ogo and impure. <br />
<br />
The Dogon say Venus and Jupiter emerged from the blood which fell on the placenta of our sun. Venus, they say, was red when she was created, her color fading progressively. Mars too is a coagulation of nebula blood or matter.<br />
<br />
The god of the universe, the Dogon's chief god, is Amma (Cf Egyptian Ammon in Egyptian section). Amma dwells in original darkness! His son is Nommo, instructor of the new world. (Note Nommo: key syllable to Om - the Demiurge, loose, theoretical connection). Amma sent the amphibious Nommo to earth. Nommo can also mean an individual. The Nommo's collectively are the &quot;masters of the water,&quot; the &quot;instructors&quot;, the &quot;monitors.&quot; The Dogons say the Nommos seat is in the water. They are said to have landed northeast of West Sudan (the Dogon's home). This would be in the direction of Egypt or the Middle East or further beyond.<br />
<br />
The Dogon describe the sound of the landing of the Nommo on earth in their ark. They say it sounded like the echoing of the four large stone blocks being struck with stones by the children, according to special rhythms, in a very small cave near Lake Debo. This is presumably a sound like a thunderous vibration. <br />
<br />
The ark landed on Ogo's dryland. Ogo is called &quot;the fox.&quot; The Dogon describe a fire propelled landing ark and a mother ark hovering above. <br />
<br />
The Nommo is the monitor of the universe the father of mankind, guardian of man's spiritual principles, dispenser of rain and master of the water generally (cf Tangaroa in Polynesian section). Not all Nommos came to earth. The one called Nommo-die, or Great Nommo, remained in heaven with Amma and he is his vicar. He manifests himself in the rainbow which is called the path of the Nommo. He is the guardian of the spiritual principles of the living creatures on earth.<br />
<br />
There are 3 other distinct Nommos, each personified as individuals.<br />
<br />
1. Nommo-Titiyayne, messenger or deputy of the Nommo-die; he executes the latter's great works. The Nommos who came to earth in an ark are presumably of this class.<br />
<br />
2. Another class of Nommos are represented by O-Nommo, Nommo of the pond. He will be sacrificed for the purification and regeneration of the universe. He will rise in a human form and descend on earth in an ark with the ancestors of men; then he will take on his original form, will rule from the waters and will give birth to many descendents. (cf Christ's death and resurrection in Christian section). <br />
<br />
3. The fourth Nommo is the disrupter Ogo, or Nommo-anagonno. As he was about to be finished being created he rebelled against his creator and introduced disorder into the universe. Eventually, he will become the Pale Fox which is the image of his fall.<br />
<br />
Nommo comes from the Dogon word &quot;nomo,&quot; to make one drink. It is said: The Nommo divided his body among men to feed them; that is why it is also said that as the universe had drank of his body the Nommo also made men drink. He also gave all his life principles to human beings. He was crucified on a &quot;kileng&quot; tree which also died, and was resurrected.<br />
<br />
The second and third Nommos are really the same in successive stages because the one who came down from the sky became &quot;Nommo of the pond&quot; and men will not utter his name out of respect, but instead call him Di-tigi, &quot;master of the water.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the future, his twin will descend with the Black Smith twin of the victim (this is an incorporation of the DT) who will also be transformed in the pond. They will have many descendents and will always be present in the fresh made water of brooks, rivers, ponds and wells and also in the female sea water (cf, Sumerian section).<br />
<br />
The Dogon say the Nommos breathed through their clavicles. <br />
<br />
The Dogon associate a 60 year period with the creation of the world by Amma. A rite or celebration called Sigui is practiced every 60 years. The symbol of this rite is called the Kanaga sign: similar to Pisces the fishes. Sigui renovates the world. Circumcision is a part of this rite. To the Dogon, the act of circumcision (meaning &quot;to cut around&quot;) symbolizes the orbit of Sirius B around Sirius A - this is speculation on Temple's part: the rites could have to do with the appearance of the generative organs of the Nommo, i.e., they would then presumably lack foreskins. The Dogon associate the number 60 with the cosmic placenta, the outer border of our solar system or major outer border which would be the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter. These two planets come together in orbit every 60 years. The Dogons associate the mutilation domination of circumcision with a victory over the femininity of Yasigni. Thus genital mutilation is symbolically associated with heavenly movements in the Sirius system. (A footnote in Josephus quotes from Ammonius suggesting that certain tribes in the ancient world were &quot;by nature&quot; circumcised from the beginning. There is no reason to assume, e.g., that the ancient Phoenician tribe of Cadmus had foreskins. Africans such as the Dogon do. One may wonder whether the Nommo or Hindu Prachetasas (fish men) had foreskins. This seems to be an area little studied by anthropology or ethnology. <br />
<br />
The Dogon call Sirius B &quot;digitaria&quot; and believe a ray of this star or beam scans the earth periodically once a year. (cf Sumerian section on the ray of Enki and the CM section on the Elder Pharos). <br />
<br />
The Dogon recognize an annual &quot;bad day&quot; which upsets people and places them in an unsure relationship with themselves and with each other. This occurs when Digitaria revolves upon its own axis once a year, ejecting on this day from its &quot;three spirals&quot; (?) the beings and the things which it contains. (cf. Call of Cthulhu by HP Lovecraft and the general disturbance Cthulhu's activity arouses in sensitive, artistic and insane minds, e.g., in Wilcox the artist in the story, CM section.) <br />
<br />
Note on Ogo's creation:<br />
<br />
Nommo and Ogo were created on twin placentas which were to give birth respectively to a pair of Nommo instructors. What happened, however, was that a single male being emerged from one of the placentas; in order to find his twin, this being tore off a piece of this placenta which became the earth. This intervention upset the order of creation: he was transformed into an animal, the pale fox, &quot;Yurugg,&quot; and communicated his own impurity to the earth which rendered it dry and barren! But the remedy to this situation was the sacrifice, to the sky, of one of the Nommo instructors which had issued from the other placenta, and the descent of his twin to earth with life giving purifying rain. The destiny of Yurugg is to pursue his twin to the end of time. Please note that pale literally means lacking in color and they are talking about fleshly things, not spiritual things. <br />
<br />
Also, there is a contradiction: Sigui is celebrated every 60 years, yet the orbital period of Sirius B is 50 years. French anthropologists have noted that Sigui appear to be brought forward so that the ceremonies are actually celebrated every 50 years. The uninitiated are thereby confused. This is one possible explanation of the contradiction. <br />
<br />
The Dogons mention eight ancestral Nommos and the initial couple of Nommo. <br />
<br />
NOTE on the Sod Ihoh: the word Sod means arcanum or religious mystery. In the Old Testament, Psalm 25 Verse 14, we read, &quot;The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him.&quot; This is a mistranslation and actually reads: &quot;Sod Ihoh are for those who fear him.&quot; Sod Ihoh would mean the mysteries or arcanum of Ihoh. Members of Priest Colleges were called Sodales in Latin. Cicero says worshipers of the Mighty Mother studied what were called the Sodalities in the Idaean Mysteries of the Mighty Mother. Sod was the name for the greatest mysteries of Baal, Adonis, and Bacchus, who at one time or another were all sun gods with Serpents as symbols. Moses was the chief of the Sodales. In the Old Testament, the dying Jacob thus describes his sons Simeon and Levi: they &quot;are brethren, instruments of cruelty are their habitations. O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly.&quot; In the original Hebrew, the words &quot;their secret&quot; reads &quot;their Sod.&quot; (Psalm 86, verse 7.) <br />
<br />
Note similarity of this syllable Sod to Sadogowah of HP Lovecraft and August Derleth's &quot;Lurker at the Threshold: Billington's Wood.&quot; It says in the tale: &quot;It had ye name Ossadogawah, which signifi'd 'ye child of Sadogowah.&quot; Cf also &quot;The Seven Geases&quot; by CA Smith, (a gease is a spell that compels you to carry out an action or series of actions) in which Ralibar Vooz is sent by the sorcerer Ezdagor as an offering to &quot;Lord Tsathoggua.&quot; HP Lovecraft also used the name Tsathoggua in &quot;Whisperer in Darkness&quot; crediting CA Smith for its invention. Note also similarity of Sod Ihoh to Sod Io or &quot;secrets of Io&quot; (see section on Io in Temple's book. See also Jewish section here.).<br />
<br />
COMMISSAR'S NOTE - BIG KEY: Right here, one can easily see how this kind of doctrine, talking about impure flesh versus pure flesh, can easily lead to a doctrine of Racial Superiority and Inferiority! Why, &quot;we were created by the PURE Nommo, our flesh is PURE. But you see those other people over there? They were created by the IMPURE Ogo and their flesh is garbage.&quot; And to think, the original indicator of &quot;impurity&quot; was paleness. Interesting! Not only did the occultists of our own early group have this information, but the &quot;Sirius Mystery&quot; by Temple was also being sold in stores catering to early Afrocentrism! <br />
<br />
When this kind of thinking got blended into the LT groups, it lead to a whole variety of Salvation Doctrines where it got transformed into a spiritual salvation or cleansing. It can lead to the Gnostic type or Manichaean dualisms where &quot;the spirit is pure and clean but the flesh is filthy.&quot; And since these LT groups came to think of the Darkness as evil when they became dualists, they came to think of all things dark as evil - or impure: including dark people. And that thinking was prevalent right up until modern times (cf: &quot;On Blackness without Blacks&quot; collection of essays by European scholars, by Gilman). <br />
<br />
This is a real historical curiosity, and what these primitive people knew - and learned about Sirius from Lemnians is positively astounding. But whoever (or whatever) invented this other &quot;fish man&quot; stuff or inspired it has caused not only a lot of misery for humans, but taught humans how to hate for no real reason. <br />
<br />
EGYPTIAN<br />
<br />
Sothis is the ancient Egyptian name for Sirius as spelled by the ancient Greeks. Sothe and sothesetai are Greek words used in the New Testament to mean saved and salvation as in the Gospel of Mark and Luke! <br />
<br />
Sirius was known to the Egyptians as Spd or Spdt (&quot;t&quot; is a feminine ending). This is transliterated in our Roman alphabet as Sept. The constellation Orion, a hunter armed with a sword shield and dagger, which rises just one hour before Sirius, was known as S3h which is transliterated as Sah. <br />
<br />
Isis was called Ast. Asti refers to the sequentiality of Egyptian thrones (see succession of Hastur Kings in Chambers, CM section.) Note similarity of the syllable Ast to the root syllables of Astarte in all of succeeding notes including its containment in the word astral, astrology, astronomy, etc. Note also pronunciation of Hastur in the CM is similar and containing the word &quot;star.&quot; Also Astaroth sounds like the same thing, plus has both &quot;ast&quot; and the word &quot;star&quot; in it. By the 18th Dynasty, Astarte had become a goddess of healing in Egypt, referred to as Astar of Syria. Ramses III calls Astarte his shield. See also Hebrew section on Canaanite Asherah, Astarte and Anath worship.<br />
<br />
Isis's consort is As-Ar or Osiris as spelled by the Greeks. Isis was identified with the very bright star Sirius, her consort with the invisible companion known to the Egyptians as the &quot;eye star.&quot; The ancient Egyptians knew just as little about the original meaning of the name As-Ar and the hieroglyphs for it as we do, suggesting that even to them the sources were exceedingly ancient and dimly recollected, or perhaps highly secret and known only to the initiates and/or priests. The confusion is extreme, especially when Temple tells us the invisible companion of Sirius was called the &quot;eye star&quot; rather than the visible one, as common sense would expect. <br />
<br />
The entire Egyptian calendar was based on the rising of the star Sirius! Traditional interpreters have explained this weakly by saying that the Egyptians worshiped Sirius because it happened to rise when the Nile flooded and irrigated Egyptian fields. This explanation is weak, circumstantial, narrow and based on a great deal of ignorance about what Egyptians actually said in their own Sirius worship.<br />
<br />
The oldest known hieroglyph for Osiris has a throne over an eye. The earliest dynastic (historical) Egyptians (ca 3200 BC) had already forgotten or lost the reason for the use of this combination. The Bozo tribe of Mali, related to the Dogon, also call the invisible companion of Sirius the eye star. Aristotle's friend Eudoxus said that the Egyptians believed their god Osiris had his legs grown together (like a Merman). <br />
<br />
To this day, Sirius is called the Dog Star and is in the constellation Canis Major, the Great Hound. Near it in the sky is Canis Minor, the Little Hound. These constellations come down to us from ancient Greece. In Plato's dialogues, the speakers swear oaths and curse &quot;By the Dog.&quot; This is thousands of years later than the Egyptian periods dealt with here. A complete review of the constellations in the sky as they relate to this Sirius lore will be given in the Greek Section, since we have a rather complete version of it through them. In fact, the entire story is told by a stellar portraiture of a &quot;battle in the sky&quot; (between Sirius and Aldebaren) that links it all together clearly and simply. Recall that the Lemnians taught the Dogon. The Greeks received their astronomy from ancient Mesopotamian sources: our constellations come from the Greeks who got them from Sumeria by way of Babylon. Sumeria predates dynastic Egypt. All of this points to the idea that even as recently as in ancient Greece, the complete story was known to some and had formed the foundation for their culture. <br />
<br />
Anubis is the Egyptian Dog headed god (cf Sumerian An). The Egyptian is actually Anpu and Agga is a synonym.<br />
<br />
After referring to the fact that Anubis was born of Nephthys, the dark sister goddess of Isis, Plutarch states: &quot;By Anubis they &lt;Egyptians&gt; understand the horizontal circle which divides the invisible part of the world, which they call Nephthys, from the visible, to which they give the name Isis; and as this circle equally touches upon the confines of both light and darkness, it may be looked upon as common to them both -- and this circumstance arose that resemblance, which they imagine between Anubis and the Dog, it being observed of this animal, that he is equally watchful as well by day as night.&quot; Plutarch indicates that Anubis protects the gods as dogs protect men. He identifies Isis with the Greek goddess of wisdom and mind: Athena. <br />
<br />
Temple interprets this passage as describing an orbit of Sirius B around Sirius A; while this is not incorrect, it is superficial. Plutarch really seems to be describing a barrier-world between worlds of light and dark and the guardians (dogs, furies, hounds) who lurk there. The light and dark worlds are the visible and invisible worlds, respectively. (This would be a DT interpretation, similar to the Chod.) There is clearly a system here of superficial versus profound interpretation or meaning depending on the level of learning or initiation involved, as in the 4 layered Dogon stages of initiation. <br />
<br />
Nephthys was the creator, the spirit of god, which hovered over the primeval waters (See CM section on Nephren Ka and further in this section on Black Rite of Osiris and Lord in Perfect Black.) Plutarch wrote in Greek, and was a priest himself, a Delphic initiate. He lived in the Roman Empire. (See note at end of this section on Plutarch's &quot;Isis and Osiris.&quot;)<br />
<br />
Nephthys in Egyptian is Nebt-het. (Cf Nebo and Nub and Neb in Sumerian section and in CM section). Neb in Egyptian means Lord.<br />
<br />
Egyptians said Anubis was the son of Isis, but is really the son of Nephthys, Isis's dark sister. Temple interprets this as a teaching geared to placing a visible stand-in (Isis) for an invisible thing (Nephthys), i.e., Sirius A as a substitute for the invisible Sirius B. The idea that divine characters are really stars, planets, etc., and even their dynamic qualities (Anubis as an orbit) was a common view of ancient pagans, as can be seen in the writings of Proclus. Temple seems unaware that these &quot;quaint&quot; stories of divine characters have also a level of meaning beyond mere astronomy or physics and go deeper into metaphysics where Anubis is not just an orbit, but rather a hound-fury like guardian of the barrier between the realm of light and dark between two kinds of space! <br />
<br />
Egyptians sometimes portrayed Isis (Sirius A) as traveling in a boat with two companions (Sirius B and C). One of them is Anubis (cf Annunaki in Sumerian section). <br />
<br />
Wallis Budge seems to have interpreted this as Temple did. E. g., Budge interpreted Anubis to mean a dynamic quality, i.e., time and a circle (see Plutarch's statement) which would equal circular motion, i.e., Anubis equals an orbit.<br />
<br />
Anubis worship was a secret mystery religion restricted to initiates in Egypt. It continued to exist right through the Roman world as the &quot;Cult of Isis.&quot; Egyptian magical treatises refer to the &quot;Black Rite&quot; of &quot;Black Osiris,&quot; The highest degree of secret initiation possible in ancient Egyptian religion. Budge believes the cult of Anubis in Egypt was older than that of Osiris.<br />
<br />
The Greek name for the Egyptian author of these treatises was Hermes Trismegistus. Hence these works are referred to as HERMETIC, or Trismegistic. (The Hermetic tradition is the one I explain in the article we sell on &quot;Set,&quot; contrasting it against the fish tradition or Spdt.)<br />
<br />
The Hermetic treatise called &quot;The Virgin of the World&quot; calls Osiris the &quot;Lord in the Perfect Black.&quot; Initiation into this rite was considered initiation into the unseen world, the mysterious black; the most secret and highest rite of all. This rite was supposedly taught by a personage referred to as Hermes who, after teaching it and other arts of civilization to mankind, with charge unto his kinsmen of the Gods to keep sure watch, he mounted to the stars. According to this treatise, mankind is a troublesome lot requiring constant scrutiny and, at rare intervals of crisis, intervention. After Hermes returned to the stars, there were people in Egypt designated as Tat (Greek word Thoth) who were these initiates.<br />
<br />
Hermes was later known as Mercury to the Romans, a swift traveling messenger of the Gods (Hermod was Odin's son and messenger in Scandinavian mythology). (CF. H. P. Lovecraft and others who refer to Nyarlathotep as the soul and messenger of the Old Ones where it is said Nyarlathotep came to ancient Khem &lt;Egypt&gt; in the form of a black man, but not a Negro. In CM section). Temple gets into difficulty and begins stretching comparisons by attempting to make the Cult of Anubis equal the Cult of Isis; Hermes equal Dagon; and Hermians equal Dogon Monitors, etc., as if there is only ONE tradition involved here - the Sirius lore of the Oannes. There were two distinct traditions and two persons or races or brotherhoods; that of the Dogon and that of the Hermetic. Had Temple understood the Chandravansa history, he'd have known that these two traditions were, and often are, at war with each other! In fact, the Dogon might be earlier than the Hermetic which would mean that Budge's information on the precedence of the Cult of Anubis refers only to Egypt or else it is incomplete. It is possible that the highest initiates had complete initiation into both teachings. According to the esoteric tradition (not referenced by scholars) the Black Rite of Osiris does involve knowing both traditions as I point out in the article &quot;Set.&quot; (cf in CM section, HPL's Haunter of the Dark, in which Dr. Dexter states he is afraid of the avatar of Nyarlathotep, who in antique and shadowy Khem took the form of man. He screams at the end of the story &quot;the three lobed burning eye.&quot; This compares with the description of Hermes as Trismegistic (thrice megistic, i.e., holy great or Magi-like) and seems to refer once again to the eye star. It also refers to Trilochana in Tantra. Damascius, the Neo-platonist, says that the Egyptian philosophers, who are resident among us, explain their occult truth as this, &quot;The one principle of the universe is celebrated as Unknown Darkness, and this three times pronounced as such.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anubis is described often as &quot;time&quot; and &quot;time the devourer.&quot; This would be like Sri Kala Chakra in Tantra: Lord Time Devourer. He is accused of devouring Apis the bull. Apis, the animal into which the dead Osiris was sewn and transported (known under the Ptolemies as Serapis) was known as Asar-Hapi. A cult of Jupiter-Serapis existed even as late as the Roman Empire. <br />
<br />
An interesting passage from the &quot;Virgin of the World&quot; refers to the secret books: &quot;The sacred symbols of the cosmic elements were hid away hard by the Secrets of Osiris. Hermes ere he returned to heaven, invoked a spell on them and spake these words: ' O holy books, who have been made by my immortal hands, by incorruption's magic spells, free from decay throughout eternity remain and incorrupt from time! Become unseeable, unfindable, for everyone whose foot shall tread the plains of this land, until old heaven doth bring forth meet instruments for you, whom the creator shall call Souls.' Thus spake he and, laying spells on them by means of his own works, he shut them safe away in their own zones (gates, mychos). And long enough the time has been since they were hid away.&quot; (This is pure DT stuff, Pentamychos tradition.)<br />
<br />
In this treatise, the highest objective of the ignorant men searching for truth is described as: &quot;Men will seek out the inner nature of the holy spaces which no foot may tread. In their daring they will track out Night, the farthest Night of all.&quot; (Cf CM section in HPL's Necronomicon &quot;The Old Ones are, not in the spaces as we know, but between them... where they still tread.... no one can behold them as they tread.). This is standard Dark Tradition stuff, the gates are the five mychos, the Pentamychos tradition. (Commissar says: One need not tread all that far: Read my stuff where these secrets are....) No joking. This stuff is secret in the same way MUSIC is secret to the tone deaf! I DO explain it - all of it. (So buy it now, order now!! Heh...) <br />
<br />
Khem means star in Egyptian, having specific reference to 50 days. Khem also means &quot;shrine, holy of holies, sanctuary&quot; and &quot;little, small&quot; also &quot;he whose name is unknown,&quot; also &quot;god of procreation and generative power,&quot; also &quot;to be hot,&quot; also &quot;unknown.&quot; <br />
<br />
Egyptians believed in holy emanations from Sirius and Orion which vivify gods, men, cattle, and creeping things, both gods and men, and are a pouring out of the soul. (cf. rays of Digitaria, Nipper and Elder Pharos of Dogon, Sumerians and CM sections respectively).<br />
<br />
They believed the deceased spirit of man goes to Nephthys in a boat. <br />
<br />
A prayer to Osiris from one of the Pyramid Texts implores &quot;Be not wroth in thy name of Tchenteru.&quot; Tchenteru means anger. Tchenteru is a two-headed god. A form of Osiris worshiped in lower Egypt was Asar-uu. Plutarch also gives Omphis as a name for Osiris (See omphalos in Greek section).<br />
<br />
Tcham is a mysterious, potent stellar metal which is said to be the power of Anubis, the personification of the orbit of Sirius B. Tcham also means heavy and weight. Plutarch says Egyptians call the lodestone (magnetic pyrite stones) the bone of Horus and call iron the bone of Typhon.<br />
<br />
Pepi I is described as directing his boat with the uas (Uaser or Asar) scepter and the tcham scepter. <br />
<br />
Septit also means Sirius and septu means triangle: Sirius has a triangle shaped tooth-like symbol as its hieroglyph. This triangle was associated with teeth, especially serpent's teeth. In Egyptian geometry, the base of the triangle was thought of as its mouth or beginning.<br />
<br />
The Sphinx is called &quot;arq ur&quot; (ur means chief or great). In Sanskrit, arksha means stellar (see Hindu section). Arq is related to our word arc for a circle, circumference, orbit or parts thereof.<br />
<br />
The Egyptian hieroglyph for a thorn, called by them a plant tooth, is almost identical to the sign for Sothis-Sirius. The Egyptian word for tooth is abeh and is the same hieroglyph as the word for earth. The syllable Ab is connected throughout Egyptian language with purity, priests, offerings, etc. The Abt is the emblem containing the head of Osiris worshiped at Abydos. Note how in modern English, words carrying the syllable &quot;ab&quot; mean the opposite, i.e., they mean dirty, base, vulgar, etc., as in abscess, abnormal, abysmal, abhorrent. This is a cultural reversal of some kind. <br />
<br />
Abeh means tooth and jackal. Anubis is a jackal. Aba means to make strong, and abt means path as of a star? or orbit?, or a way. <br />
<br />
Note on change of Egyptian culture: After abut 1000 BC, innovations in Egyptian culture took place and the old system fell into complete decay, like a relic. Ra arose in popularity as a Sun god. In this period, the supreme god was called Ammon-Ra. Sirius became less important to impatient priests who wanted more obvious ideas. Perhaps when this began to happen, some purists may have gone off to other places where they hoped to retain traditions without interference from decadent Pharaohs. This may explain legends of the sailing of the Argonauts to Rhodes, the Greek Thebes as opposed to Thebes in Egypt, etc. <br />
<br />
The Egyptian monster of darkness is Apap. He possessed many names. To destroy him it was necessary to curse him by each and every name by which he was known. A list of such names is on the Papyrus of Nesi-Amsu, one of them is Tutu, also one of the names of Marduk (see Sumerian section). Tutu is, according to Budge, a form of the god Shu, whose symbol is a lion walking. Shu is similar to the Sumerian Shuba. Shu and Shuba both mean bright. <br />
<br />
Horus in Egyptian is Heru, an ancient name of the sun god. Heru also means face. There are many references in Egyptian writings to Horus-Osiris. Neb could also be derived from Neb-Heru; then Neb-Heru means lord of the sun. There is a Heru-ami-Sept-t or Horus of Sothis; and also a Heru-Sept, or Horus the Dog Star. <br />
<br />
Egyptians temples were oriented to the rising of the star Canopus in the Constellation Argo. Another name for Canopus, which forms the rudder of the constellation Argo (which is an ark, or boat) is Kahi-Nub. In Coptic Egyptian, Kahi-Nub means Golden Earth. Canopus was considered a star of Osiris. Canopus has the root syllable &quot;can&quot; which means dog. The Alfonsine Tablets tells how the designation of Canopus as heavy was once applied to another star near Orion (obviously Sirius), but fled to the south (Argo is south of Orion and Sirius in the sky). Again, Temple takes this to be another instance in which references to the invisible Sirius B became attached to a visible star - this time Canopus. It is more likely that a cultural change occurred. <br />
<br />
In Egypt, Qeti is a god of the abyss. Another version is Qetqet, one of their 36 gods: Qeti also means orbit and oarsmen. The constellation Argo is an arc or boat with 50 oarsmen (cf Sumerian Annunaki who hold large wooden beams like oars; also 50 Argonauts). <br />
<br />
The Christians destroyed a site of rites of Canopus by destroying the temple sites near the mouth of the Nile near Behdet in order to supplant paganism there. This destroyed the continued Sirius tradition there.<br />
<br />
There is a sacred cow identified with Isis called Hathor. Hathor is our form of the Egyptian He-t-her, which means House of Horus. <br />
<br />
Asti refers in Egyptian to the sequentiality of thrones, their succession (cf the succession of Hastur kings in Chambers &quot;King in Yellow: Repairer of Reputations.&quot; CM section). <br />
<br />
Aakhuti means the two spirits, Isis and Nephthys. <br />
<br />
The Egyptians also associated a 60 year period with Osiris. The Hymn to Osiris says &quot;most terrible is his name of Asar. The duration of his existence is an eternal henti period in his name of Un-nefer.&quot; The henti period consisted of two periods, each containing 60 years. <br />
<br />
The Egyptians, like the Dogons, had a rite of circumcision which the Jews acquired from them while in bondage or captivity there.<br />
<br />
Note that Shu is symbolized by a lion walking, as previously mentioned. The domain of Osiris is surrounded by an iron enclosure. The Egyptians also called the star which was the domain of Osiris, &quot;Osiris-Eloh&quot; (as in Elohim). He came here to relieve man of trouble, encountered evil, was temporarily overcome by it, killed, buried and after 3 days arose and ascended to heaven and in this regard, is like Horus. This was written 4,000 years before the birth of Christ and the comparisons are all too obvious! <br />
<br />
Horus is the son of Osiris, who kills Apap (Apophis) the Serpent of Evil. Horus is of the same substance as his father Osiris, an incarnation of him, but also identical to him. He is chaste, has no lovers. He is associated with the judgement of men and introduces souls to his father Osiris the judger of the dead. The Feast of Horus was December 21. At this time, a fish-like baby would be carried about in a carriage, representing Horus. This custom existed long after Egypt declined. An ancient Egyptian title of Horus was &quot;Guardian of the Gates.&quot; Again, the comparison is too obvious. <br />
<br />
Typhon is identified with Apap. Typhon incarnates in Apap and devours souls. <br />
<br />
Much of this information on Typhon comes down to us by way of ancient Greece and Rome. Typhon is said to be a lower aspect or shadow of Osiris, but also his brother; i.e., of the divine body of Osiris, but lower. Typhon battles the God of Wisdom (Thoth) who has authority over all other gods. Typhon steals reason from the soul and is therefore the enemy of wisdom, Thoth. Thoth is the master of the dog-headed apes. Aasten is one of these ape-gods in the company of Thoth. He presided over the seven (other ape-gods). <br />
<br />
Thoth may have originally been pronounced Tahuti. Izzu-Tahuti was a power behind Tahuti. <br />
<br />
Later writers describe him as good and call him Typhon-Set. The slaying of Osiris by Set could be interpreted as an allegory to code or conceal the destruction of the Osiris knowledge later on. The Osiris Mystery cults declined or concealed themselves thereafter. The rise of monotheism evidenced in Sumeria (Cult of Marduk) was conjoined with the destruction of the Cult of Osiris and of Isis. Venus (the planet) was called Typhon-Set as envisioned above, battling Isis-Osiris. Keep in mind, as TeVelda states in &quot;Seth God of Confusion,&quot; all things we'd call Semite were at this time called Set by Egyptians as their tribal name (descendents of Seth - or Set) and this antagonism toward the Deity may have been due to antagonism toward people, rigid monotheists who condemned the pagans around them, that didn't get along with others. The meanings of the Deity names changed during this later time. It may have been well known in the ancient world that Moses (Moshe) was none but Thut Moshe, the former priest of Akhnaten - and Akhnaten was hated for his intolerance and monotheism. <br />
<br />
The Pharaoh Tutankhamen was originally named Tutankhaten (note ankh, amen and aten). His father in law was Akhnaten and mother in law Nerfititi. A geodetic religious market dispute lay behind Akhnaten's desire to build a new geodetic capital city which he did, outraging priests. He was also intolerant of other cults. <br />
<br />
Note on Plutarch's &quot;On Isis and Osiris.&quot; Typhon here refers to Set, not to Sutekh the original Hyksos wild-boar god. In this work, Plutarch states &quot;for Isis is a Greek word, and so is &quot;Typhon, her enemy; for he is puffed up by ignorance and deceitfulness; he tears in pieces and buries out of sight the sacred word, which the goddess again gathers up and puts together and gives into the care of those who are initiated.&quot; <br />
<br />
Plutarch states her temple is called the Iseion (cf, Zion, the city of David on Mount Zion, i.e., Jerusalem. See Hebrew section). However, Zion may be etymologically delivered from the Hebrew Tsiyon, a hill. ? <br />
<br />
Plutarch states that fish are forbidden to eat in her cult at Hermoupolis.<br />
<br />
He states that of the 365 days of the year, the Egyptians consider the 5 additional and celebrated them as birthdays of the gods. On the first, Osiris was born; on the second Arueris whom some call Apollo, some the elder Horus; on the third, Typhon was born neither in due time nor in the right place, but by breaking through with a blow and leaping out of his mother's side; on the fourth Isis, in the moist regions; on the fifth, Nephthys. Isis they (Egyptians) say was begotten by Hermes, Osiris and Arueris by the Sun and Typhon and Nephthys by Kronos. The third day (of Typhon) was considered inauspicious and no one would do business on it, not even attending to bodily needs until evening. <br />
<br />
When Osiris became king, he made the Egyptians give up their destitute and brutish mode of life, showing them the fruits produced by cultivation and giving them laws and teaching them how to worship the gods. After doing this he traveled over the whole earth, civilizing it, introducing music and all kinds of music. When this kind returned, Set devised a plot against him with a helper queen who came from Ethiopia whom they call Aso. The first to discover this plot were the Pans and Satyrs. Anubis, Plutarch states, is said to guard the gods just as dogs guard men. (Mytho-jargon: Seti people allied with Ethiopians and people in the Pan cultures discovered it. Explained in Set.)<br />
<br />
Horus, Isis's son, battled Set for many days. Horus was victorious but Isis, after receiving from him Set bound in chains, did not destroy him, but on the contrary, released him and let him go free. (The Schesu-her - Horus culture, did this to the Seti people). <br />
<br />
Plutarch says that it is correct to credit Set with whatever in the elements is either immoderate or disordered by reason of excesses of deficiencies, while all that is well ordered and good and beneficial we must reverence and honor as the work of Isis, and as the image, imitation, and reason of Osiris. Osiris, he states, is life giving moisture; Set the fatal heat and dryness of the desert. Set stands for all that is hostile to and destructive of life. Osiris is the reason and logos in the soul and the principle of order in the material world. Set is the opposite. Plutarch interchanges Typhon and Set here. Plutarch also speaks of when Osiris became Phtah spirit, Lunus intuition; Logos reason and Typhon passion. Set is against all this. Isis is like a Mother Goddess. These Greeks changed all of this into this. Set or Spdt may have once been Sirius A, an objective star. When Set was Sutekh, the Greek Typhon-passion it was not the Egyptian's own God but the conquering Hyksos's God - a wild boar. Later, Typhon was passion, Set was a deceiver yet the two were mentioned together. Typhon-Set was like a liar - and Typhon in the Greek sense was passion. It's obvious to anyone who knows how to read it that they are talking about groups of people. When Set was good, Seti people were liked. When Set was no good, Seti people, or some of them, were considered no good, battled, chained up and then set free. <br />
<br />
Another Roman, Apuleius, who wrote of an initiate into the cult of Isis named Lucius, has Lucius testifying as to the great power of Isis, whose right hand is so powerful that she can unweave even the inextricable skein of the Fates; the tempests of Fortune she assuages and restrains the baleful motions of the stars. It is she that whirls the sphere of heaven, that gives light to the sun, that governs the universe and tramples down Tartarus... the elements serve Isis. Note that a skein is a tangle as of yarn or thread and the Fates are Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos, who weaved the web of a man's life. The power of the stars over a man's destiny was a truism of the ancient world (and still exists in Astrology today). The sun's power was universally recognized. Tartarus signified the infernal regions wherein the wicked are punished. Yet Isis had dominion over all this. <br />

Infact when I did a search as to some of the resourses listed in your copy and paste jobber, I FOUND THE EXACT WORD FOR WORD PARAGRAPH under another web site!<br />

HOW DOES THAT SHOW ME HOW INTELEGENT YOU ARE? <br />

<br />
Glad to see you back and up an running to take care of this joker.  Frankly, he bores me with his diatribes.  He really thinks he has a corner on this &quot;esoteric&quot; knowledge.  You have more patience than I do with this type.  He won't last long.  He actually believes that there are followers here according to his &quot;advice&quot; to Natas.  It should be fun to watch you guys take this one down a bit.  I know, Christians shouldn't have this much fun!!&lt;hr size=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; color=&quot;#000099&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Zerubbabel--The Seed of Babylon</div>
