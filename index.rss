What John Titor had done, was come back from an undetermined future and say lots about possable events, that could, or could not have happened.<br />

<br />
There are about three other realities besides this one, that are scailer adjustment parallel to this reality.<br />
<br />
In one, the Axis had fought a non-allied United States...<br />

The quantum Hall effect, discovered in the 1980s, is an important fundamental effect in condensed matter physics that links topological states with electronic properties in two-dimensional systems. The quantized conductance is prescribed by an integer global topological invariant and is therefore protected against perturbations. Such invariants are characterized by a so-called...<br />
